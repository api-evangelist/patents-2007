title: Reuse of business logic of reports as data sources
abstract: An InfoSet API calls a query, the call defining selections for data retrieval. These selections are passed by the query to a report, which obtains data responsive to the selections via a data source. The obtained data is persisted in a global memory which allows such data to be accessed in multiple sessions. The persisted data is retrieved from the global memory by the query which in turns provides such data in response to the InfoSet API call. Techniques for automatically creating aspects of Infosets are also described as well as other related techniques, apparatus, systems, and articles.
