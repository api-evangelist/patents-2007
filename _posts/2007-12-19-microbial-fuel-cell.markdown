title: Microbial fuel cell
abstract: A modified microbial fuel cell with a halogen salt or salt water oxidizer. The fuel cell is a batch cell, but flow-through cell embodiments are also envisioned. The cathode and anode are separated by a cation exchange membrane or saline bridge. The anode contains microorganisms in media or various water bed sediments. The cathode contains water and a halogenated salt oxidizer. The fuel cells operated continuously for over 3 months, providing approximately 10 times more power than those in the current literature for batch cells.

This application claims priority to currently pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 870 656 entitled Microbial Fuel Cell filed on Dec. 19 2006 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. DASG60 00 C 0089 awarded by Special Operations Command SOCOM . The Government therefore has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates to microbial fuel cells. Specifically the invention relates to using halogen salt oxidizers to increase the electrical output of microbial fuel cells.

The availability of energy to power instruments devices or equipment for different purposes is very important. For remote or unattended applications batteries or fuel cells are needed. The choice of power source for instruments and communication networks are dependent on the environment and power needs of the device. For equipment that is placed in remote locations such as at the bottom of the ocean or intended for long term deployment power sources that run for a long duration are advantageous.

Work on fuel cells began in the early 19th century. Whereas batteries release energy stored in a closed system fuel cells are energy conversion systems transferring electricity from replenishing sources of external fuel. Fuel cells may produce electricity continuously if provided a sufficient flow of the external fuel as opposed to batteries.

Microbial fuel cells are being developed to provide long term power for a variety of applications for remote sensing and long duration studies. The cells are an attractive choice for this application due to the longevity of the cells. Microbial fuel cells convert chemical energy to electrical through a catalytic reactions using microorganisms. The cells are comprised of two chambers separated by a cation exchange membrane. The anode chamber contains microorganisms in a microorganism specific media. The media is a fed into the fuel cell where microorganisms catabolize the compound under anaerobic conditions producing carbon dioxide protons and electrons.

The second chamber is a cathode chamber containing deionized D.I. water with an oxidizer. Typical microbial fuel cells use potassium ferricyanide potassium hydrogen phosphate oxygen hydrogen peroxide manganses dioxide or copper chloride as the oxidizer.

Electrons gained from this process enter an electrical circuit providing current. One drawback of microbial fuel cells is the low power output due in part to electron transfer efficiency. Previous modifications to address this shortcoming have included electron mediators or mediatorless microbes. Redox mediators couple the electron reduction through oxidative metabolism in a microbe to the reduction of the electron acceptor on the cathode. Zeikus et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 495 023 columns 3 and 4 .

However even with the advances made in microbial fuel cells the process still produces only small electrical currents far below the energy production of other fuel cells. What is needed is a more efficient electron transfer device.

The microbial fuel cells are comprised of two chambers separated by a cation exchange membrane. The anode chamber contains microorganisms in a media and the cathode chamber contains D.I. water with one of various oxidizers. The fuel cell is a batch cell but flow through cell embodiments are also envisioned. The cathode chamber and anode chamber are separated by either a cation exchange membrane or saline bridge. Nafion 117 DuPont and CMI 7000 Membranes International Inc. have been used as the cation exchange membrane. In other embodiments a potassium chloride agar saline bridge was utilized to transfer cations.

The anode chamber contains microorganisms in a media. Microgoranisms may include and . The mixed microorganisms in various water bed sediments have also been utilized in the anodic chamber. The microorganisms are suspended in media appropriate to the selected microorganism. Appropriate media includes Luria Bertani LB media carbohydrates such as glucose or acetate Tartoff Hobbs broth Terriffic Broth LBM media GTE solution SOB media SOC media minimal medium for or other. Electron mediators such as 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid disodium salt AQDS safranine O resazurin methylene blue and humic acids can be used to aid in the electron transfer process as known in the art.

The cathode chamber contains water and an oxidizer. Typical cells use oxygen potassium ferricyanide potassium hydrogen phosphate hydrogen peroxide manganese dioxide or copper chloride the copper cathode as an oxidizer. These chemicals are coupled with various cathodes graphite cloth or rods or metals platinum or palladium . The present invention uses halogenated salts as the oxidizer in the cathode. Examples of useful halogenated salts are lithium fluoroantimonate V LiSbF LiClO lithium bis oxalato borate LiB CO lithium triflate LiCFSO LiN SOCF lithium hexafluorophosphate LiPF lithium tetrafluoroborate LiBF lithium hexafluoroarsenate monohydrate LiAsF LiCFSO LiBC and LiBF. Further suitable lithium salts include chelated orthoborates and chelated orthophosphates collectively hereinafter ortho salts . Exemplary ortho salts include lithium bis oxalato borate LiBOB lithium bis malonato borate LiBMB lithium bis difluoromalonato borate LiBDFMB trichloro isocyanuric acid and sodium dichloro isocyanuric acid lithium malonato oxalato borate LiMOB lithium difluoromalonato oxalato borate LiDFMOB lithium tris oxalato phosphate LiTOP and lithium tris difluoromalonato phosphate LiTDFMP .

In one embodiment fuel cell is powered by a mixed population of microbes in marine sediment. The fuel cell uses the marine sediment as the anode chamber with the release of electrons occurring in the sediment itself. The electrons are collected by the anode about 10 cm below the surface of the sedimentation and transferred to an electrical circuit. The cation produced by the microbe reduction passes through the sediment which acts as a cation exchanger to the cathode chamber filled with a halogen salt oxidizer which oxidizes the cation to form water.

The fuel cell chambers use a cathode and an anode made of graphite cloth graphite rod carbon fiber veil carbon mesh carbon cloth or platinum or palladium covered metal.

The microbial fuel cell of the current invention is preferably comprised of two chambers separated by a cation exchange membrane. The anode chamber is a closed or batch system and contains a non renewing suspension of microorganisms in media.

The batch fuel cell seen in comprises an anode chamber containing DH5 in LB broth media. The LB broth is prepared as specified on the bottle 25 g in 1 L and autoclaved for 15 minutes at 121 C. A cation exchange made of Nafion 117 DuPont or CMI 7000 Membranes International Inc. are employed. The cathode chamber contains deionized water and a halogenated salt oxidizer. The exemplary fuel cells employed trichloro isocyanuric acid or sodium dichloro isocyanuric acid. shows an alternative embodiment where the fuel cell is a flow through cell.

The anode and cathode are made from carbon mesh with an area of about 18 cm. The cathode also has a platinum or palladium coating on the electrode which acts as a catalyst.

The fuel cells shown after testing in operated continuously for over 3 months providing around 260 mW mand between 0.4V 0.6V with a 1000 load. This is a factor of 10 times greater than those in the current literature for batch cells. Another example of future cell microbial fuel design employing the current invention is shown in .
