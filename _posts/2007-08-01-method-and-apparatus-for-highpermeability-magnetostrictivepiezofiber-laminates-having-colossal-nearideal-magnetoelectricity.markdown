title: Method and Apparatus for High-Permeability Magnetostrictive/Piezo-Fiber Laminates Having Colossal, Near-Ideal Magnetoelectricity
abstract: An ME composite laminate of at least one (1-3) piezo-fiber layer coupled with high-permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers, optionally formed of FeBSiC or equivalent. The composite laminate alternates the (1-3) piezo-fiber and high-permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers in a stacked manner. Optionally, the magnetization direction of the high-permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers and polarization direction of the piezo-fiber layer are an (L-L) arrangement. Optionally, thin film polymer layers are between the (1-3) piezo-fiber layer and high-permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers. Optionally, piezo-electric fibers within the (1-3) piezo-fiber layer are poled by inter-digitated electrodes supported by the thin film polymer, arranged as alternating symmetric longitudinally-poled “push-pull” units.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 834 557 filed Aug. 1 2006.

This invention was made with government support under Grant Number N00014 04 1 0492 awarded by the Office of Naval Research. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates generally to structures having coupled piezoelectric and magnetostrictive structures and more particularly to laminate composites of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers.

Magnetoelectricity ME is a characteristic of certain materials and composites defined as a magnetization induced by an applied electric field and the inverse i.e. an electric polarization induced by an applied magnetic field. Materials and composites exhibiting ME can be employed for various purposes including detecting magnetic fields. Sensitivity the ratio of the change in polarization to the change in magnetic field is one ME performance metric. One measure of sensitivity is the ME field coefficient or defined as the E H ratio in volts per centimeter per Oersted V cm Oe .

ME is exhibited by certain single phase bulk materials such as CrOand BiFeO and certain single phase epitaxial films. However the highest published ME measurement at room temperature of CrOcrystals shows a sensitivity of approximately 2.67 10s m or equivalently E H 0.01 V cm Oe. See e.g. V. J. Folen et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 6 607 608 1961 . The sensitivity of such single phase materials however is generally too low to be useful for most applications.

ME effects exhibited by certain multiphase arrangements formed of mechanically coupled magnetostrictive and piezoelectric phases are significantly greater. In fact the ME sensitivity of such composites can be orders of magnitude higher the sensitivity of known single phase materials. Therefore because sensitivity is a critical requirement in various devices and applications employing ME such composites are almost always utilized.

The general principles by which composites of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric phases exhibit ME effects are straightforward. When the composite is placed in a magnetic field the magnetostrictive phase undergoes dimensional change. This in turn distorts the piezoelectric phase that is mechanically coupled to the magnetostrictive phase. The piezoelectric phase therefore generates a voltage.

There are many known arrangements of such ME composites. One arrangement is a composite laminate which is a lamination of layers of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric phases in a generally alternating sequence. One classification scheme for such composite laminates is the Newnham which is generally in terms of the respective relative directions of the polarization axis of the piezoelectric layer s the magnetization axis of the magnetostrictive layer s and the axes in which the layers extend. Known types include the L P the L T and the L L which are discussed in greater below.

Existing composite laminates of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric phases employ a steady state or DC magnetic field referenced herein as Hto increase the ME sensitivity of the devices. In prior art ME composite laminates high sensitivity requires a high H. High H though typically requires high power consumption.

The highest attained in the prior art has been termed giant ME field coefficients. Examples of such giant ME coefficients have been reported for L T longitudinally magnetized transversely poled composites of piezoelectric Pb Zr Ti O PZT layers laminated with layers of magnetostrictive TbDyFeor Terfenol D 2V cm Oe see .S. Dong J. F. Li and D. Viehland Appl. Phys. Lett. 83 2265 2003 or laminated with Permendur 0.8V cm Oe see U. Lestin et al. Applied Physic A Materials Science Processing 78 1 33 2004 or Fe Ga 0.4V cm Oe see S. Dong et al. J. Appl. Phys. 97 10392 2005 or NiFeO 0.45V cm Oe see G. Srinivasab et al. Phys. Rev. B 64 214408 2001 .

Further composite laminates having giant ME coefficients are disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 7 023 206 the 206 patent issued to inventors of the present invention which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIG. 2 of the 206 patent discloses an example L P configuration and FIG. 5 of the 206 patent discloses example L L configuration. Magnetic sensors according to the 206 patent s L P configuration have shown ME sensitivities of approximately 55 mV Oe at a bias of about 500 Oe. Magnetic sensors according to the 206 patent s L L configuration have shown sensitivities of approximately 225 mV Oe at a bias in the approximate range of 600 800 Oe.

The values obtained by the prior art however are orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical values for reasons not known in the prior art.

The present invention is an ME composite laminate providing a colossal ME coefficient approaching that of the theoretical limit of ME composite laminates.

Embodiments include L L configurations providing values of approaching the theoretical limit of L L ME composite laminates providing more than one hundred times the ME coefficient of the known existing L L ME composites at approximately one hundredth the Hbias level. These embodiments obtain the near ideal magnetoelectricity latent in the L L configuration which prior art L L ME structures have not achieved.

The present invention achieves these and other described benefits with an arrangement of high permeability magnetostrictive alloy layers coupled to a 1 3 piezo fiber layer.

Samples embodying the present invention have been constructed and clearly exhibit colossal ME coefficients of greater than 20 V cm Oe under biases as small as 5 Oe. This approaches the theoretical limit identified by the present inventors for L L configuration ME composite laminates.

The present inventors identify the theoretical limit of in V cm Oe in the case of perfect or ideal ME coupling as

where Sand Sare the elastic compliances for the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive layers kthe electromechanical coupling coefficient of the piezoelectric layer dand gthe longitudinal piezomagnetic and piezoelectric voltage coefficients and n a thickness fraction of magnetostrictive layers.

The present inventors identify the L L configuration having a theoretical upper limit to its ME sensitivity higher than any other composite laminate configuration e.g. L T P P or L P .

The present inventors have identified however that prior art implementations of the L L configurations have nowhere approached the theoretical limit defined by Eq. No. 1.

Referring to Eq. No. 1 is proportional to the piezoelectric voltage gcoefficient rather than to the piezoelectric constant d.

The present inventors identify that further to Eq. No. 1 the prior art has attempted lamination of piezo layers with a 1 3 phase connectivity rather than a monolithic piezoelectric layer to magnetostrictive layers. Example include prior art investigations include 1 3 ME composites consisting of PZT rods in a Terfenol D matrix described by C. W. Nan et al. Appl. Phys. Lett. 87 012503 2005 .

The present inventors identify these attempts as unsuccessful as none has obtained anywhere close to the theoretical limit of for reasons that are not known in the prior art. The recorded by Nan et al. was approximately 00.5 V cm Oe under a required Hof 2000 Oe. The L L configuration illustrated at FIG. 5 of the 206 patent shows a value of approximately 0.225 mV cm Oe at a bias in the approximate range of 600 800 Oe. According to the present inventors investigation this is nowhere near the theoretical maximum defined by Eq. No. 1.

The present invention solves these problems with L L configurations of the prior art and obtains approaching the ideal value defined by Eq. No. 1. This is more than 100 times the attained in the prior art attempts and this solving a long felt need for a very high .

Embodiments of the present invention include laminates of at least one 1 3 piezo fiber layer with high permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers. One illustrative example high permeability alloy for the magnetostrictive layer is FeBSiC. Embodiments include L L configurations. As described in greater detail below these L L embodiments provide values of approaching the theoretical limit of L L ME composite laminates more than one hundred times the ME coefficient of the known existing L L ME composites at approximately one hundredth the Hbias level.

Preferably the arrangement of the laminate alternates in a stacked manner 1 3 piezo fiber and high permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers.

Preferably the number of high permeability alloy magnetostrictive layers exceeds the number of 1 3 piezo fiber layers by one.

One embodiment comprises an L L ME composite laminate formed of one 1 3 piezo fiber layer arranged between two high permeability magnetostrictive alloy layers.

One example arrangement is one 1 3 piezoelectric PZT fiber layer between two high permeability magnetostrictive FeBSiC alloy e.g. Metglas foils.

The enormous ME coefficient values of ME composite laminates according to these embodiments at low very biases is colossal magnetoelectricity.

The present inventors observe without any statement of theoretical conclusion that the colossal effects provided by these embodiments occur due to the following three effects and phenomena i optimum stress transfer in the L L 2 1 configuration ii the large dand magnetic flux concentration effect of high permeability FeBSiC alloy layer and iii the high gof the 1 3 piezofiber layer.

The present inventors observe without any statement of theoretical conclusion that the prior art ME composite laminates do not adequately provide or attain these effects and phenomena and therefore fall orders of magnitude short of the theoretical limit to ME defined by for example Eq. No. 1.

Further certain arrangements according to the present invention provide a colossal ME coefficient that is frequency independent in the quasi static range.

Further certain arrangements according to the present invention exhibit a colossal ME coefficient that at a selected resonant frequency is even more significantly increased.

Also arrangements according to the present invention provide a colossal ME coefficient with a response that is highly anisotropic offering unidirectional sensitivity.

Referring to the thickness not separately labeled of the high permeability magnetostrictive alloy layers A and B is selected and optimized as understood and readily performed by a person of ordinary skill in the art upon reading this disclosure using well known computer modeling and simulation methods based on the intended application and performance characteristic. One illustrative example thickness is approximately 25 microns thickness having a relative permeability of 40 000 due to low magneto crystalline anisotropy and having a low saturation magnetostriction of 40 ppm at H

With continuing reference to the piezo fiber layer is preferably a 1 3 piezoelectric active fiber epoxy composite having the piezo fibers oriented along the longitudinal axis LX of the layer. The fibers may for example be PZT 5A ceramic fibers PMN PT or PZN PT single crystal fibers or equivalent. An illustrative example fiber thickness not separately numbered may for example be approximately 100 m and an illustrative example fiber width not separately numbered may for example be approximately 350 m. The fibers preferably extend the length of the piezo fiber layer .

With continuing reference to an upper thin polymer e.g. Klapton or equivalent insulating field A and lower insulating field and B with inter digitated ID electrodes A and B respectively may be placed between the high permeability magnetostrictive alloy layers A and B and the piezo layer .

Referring to the exploded view region of the inter digitated ID electrodes A and B are preferably formed with respect to the piezo fibers in the piezo fiber layer such that each fiber not separately numbered has numerous alternating symmetric longitudinally poled push pull units each formed of a center electrode pair upper and lower A of one polarity surrounded by two outer electrode pairs B arranged with a spacing between adjacent like polarity electrodes in the LX direction. An illustrative example 2 IP dimension is approximately 1 mm. This multiple push pull L L configuration is preferable as the present inventors observe without any statement of theoretical conclusion that likely this optimizes stress transfer and enhances the dielectric capacitance of the laminate.

With continuing reference to all of the upper electrodes ID of the inter digitated electrodes A of positive polarity are connected together by a rail conductor not separately numbered extending in the LX direction which connects to a plus terminal labeled P. Likewise all of the lower electrodes ID of the inter digitated electrodes B of the same positive polarity are connected together by a rail conductor not separately numbered extending in the LX direction which connects to the same positive terminal labeled P. Similarly all of the upper electrodes ID of the inter digitated electrodes A of negative polarity are connected together by a rail conductor not separately numbered extending in the LX direction and all of the lower electrodes ID of the inter digitated electrodes B of negative polarity are connected together by a rail conductor not separately numbered also extending in the LX direction both of these rails connecting to a negative terminal labeled N.

The positive terminal P and the negative terminal N may connect to an amplifier not shown in accordance with conventional ME sensor methods.

The layers A B and insulating fields A B with inter digitated ID electrodes A B may be assembled into the laminate composite using an epoxy resin not shown .

One sample was constructed having a 1 3 piezo fiber layer according to layer approximately 30 mm long between two FeBSiC high permeability magnetostrictive alloy layers arranged according to the layers A and B each approximately the same 30 mm in length.

A second longer laminate sample was also constructed by laminating a 1 3 piezo fiber layer also having a length of approximately 30 mm between two high permeability magnetostrictive FeBSiC layers each approximately 100 mm in length. Following Nenham s composite nomenclature these ME laminates have a 2 1 connectivity of magnetic piezoelectric phases.

With continuing reference to the inset shows d dt as a function of the length of the FeBSiC and Terfenol D layers measured using a search coil. The present inventors note that the flux in the FeBSiC layer cross section area is A 7 0.025 mm is much higher approximately twenty times greater than that of Terfenol D A 6 1.5 mm and also that d dt 1 for the FeBSiC layer. As will be understood by a person or ordinary skill this shows the FeBSiC layer arranged as described herein as a superior dc biased piezomagnetic layer for ME laminate composites and that can operate under reduced H.

The voltage induced across the ID electrodes of the piezo fiber layer of the samples was measured as a function of i Hand ii as a function of the frequency under the following conditions i as a function of Hin response to a constant ac 1 kHz magnetic drive of H 1 Oe both applied along the length of the laminate and ii as a function of under constant H 1 Oe and H 4 Oe. In this measurement an electromagnet was used to apply H a pair of Helmholtz coils was used to generate a small H and the induced voltage was measured by a lock in amplifier.

Referring to is shown as a function of H with data shown for both short LN 30 mm and long LN 100 mm laminates arranged according to .

With continuing reference to present inventors observe without any statement of theoretical conclusion that likely at least the following two phenomena are exhibited by ME composite laminates according to the invention 

These data reveal maximum values of 10 short and 22 V cm Oe long under Hdc of 20 and 4 Oe respectively which corresponds to 1.8 10and 4 10s m or C m Oe. These maximum values are colossal compared to the closest performing comparable prior art that art showing an in the range of approximately 0.5 to 2.2 V cm Oe and an of approximately 0.1 V cm Oe at Hof 300 Oe and requires biases approximately 1 60 of what is required by such art.

These colossal values of approach the theoretical limit for the case of near ideal MA coupling shown in Eq. 1 as illustrated in .

Magnetostrictive piezoelectric laminates operated in an L T mode have been analyzed showing ME voltage coefficient Vcan be given as

In Table I important parameters for Metglas and PZNPT are given. The maximum dof FeBSiC is 3 4 times larger than that of Terfenol D and dof PZNPT crystals approximately 5 times larger than that PZT. Accordingly much higher values of Vand Qcan be expected for L T FeBSiC PZNPT fiber laminates than for Terfenol D PZT ones. Furthermore the extremely high permeability 40 000 of FeBSiC alloys will dramatically reduce the saturation field relative to that of Terfenol D 10 which subsequently will result in a dramatic reduction in the required dc magnetic bias H. Furthermore according to Eq. 3 a ME laminate containing more piezoelectric fibers will have a larger A resulting in a higher ME charge coefficient Q.

The present inventors chose high permeability FeBSiC alloy ribbons Metglas Inc Conway S.C. as the magnetostrictive layers and PZN 7 PT single crystal fibers poled in a dconfiguration Microfine Materials Tech Singapore as the piezoelectric one. A thin PZN PT crystal plate oriented along 100 in its length direction was cut into fibers of size 15 mm in length 0.4 mm in width and 0.1 mm in thickness. A piezoelectric fiber layer has a high capacitance in its thickness direction which is quite thin therefore it has potential for achieving high ME charge coupling.

The FeBSiC ribbons were 100 mm long 5 mm wide and 25 m thick. Two FeBSiC alloy ribbons and one PZN PT single crystal fiber layer were then bonded together using an epoxy resin and heated at 80 C. for 30 minutes forming a long type ME composite with a two dimensionally connected magnetic phase and one dimensionally connected piezoelectric phase i.e. a 2 1 phase connectivity.

During ME measurements dc H and ac H magnetic fields were applied along the length of the laminates. An electromagnet was used to provide H and a Helmholtz coil was used to generate H 1 Oersted. A lock in amplifier SR850 generated a controllable input current to the Helmholtz coil and was also subsequently used to measure the output voltage induced across the PZN PT layer of the ME laminate by H.

The present inventors measured the effect of length of the FeBSiC layer on the required Hfor the ME laminate in . The present inventors identify that in the prior art the flux in ME laminates is near linearly increased as the length of the Metglas layer is increased this is simply because long type high layers can collect more magnetic flux. In addition long magnetic layers in ME laminates are important in lowering the required H because it can effectively decrease the demagnetization factor N and reduce the saturation field.

The present inventors measured the ME responses of the FeBSiC PZN PT L T mode laminate of . shows the low frequency 1 kHz ME voltage coefficient as a function of dc magnetic bias H. The maximum value of this coefficient at sub resonant frequencies can be seen to be V 10V cm Oe under a very low H 2 Oe this is approximately 5 times higher than the highest value for a L T configuration previously reported which was for Terfenol D PMN PT V 2V cm Oe under a H 500 Oe. The required H 2 Oe is dramatically lower than that of the prior art.

The present inventors determined that the corresponding maximum value in the ME charge coefficient was Q 1 nC Oe.

Referring to Eq. Nos. 2 and 3 the present inventors observe without any statement of theoretical conclusion that these large values of the ME coefficients can likely be attributed to i the high apparent piezomagnetic coefficient dof the magnetostrictive FeBSiC alloy phase due to flux concentration ii the high gand dof the PZN PT single crystal fibers and iii the 2 1 connectivity of the ME laminate configuration that causes a more intimate contact between the two phases.

Further the present inventors observe without any statement of theoretical conclusion that the low value of H can be attributed to i the high m of the FeBSiC magnetic layers ii long type configuration of the ME laminate and iii the large compliance of the piezoelectric fibers.

Finally we also measured the magnetic field sensitivity of L T FeBSiC PZNPT fiber laminates at 1 Hz and 20 kHz. The experimental data not given showed that this type of ME laminate had a ME sensitivity of approximately 10T and 10T at 1 Hz and resonance respectively.

In summary the present inventors identify that the present invention s long type FeBSiC PZNPT fiber laminates operated in a L T mode have large ME voltage and charge coefficients of 10.5V cm Oe and 1 nC Oe respectively at low frequency and under a lowest dc magnetic bias H 2 Oe which were dramatically enhanced under resonance drive to 400V cm Oe and 42 nC Oe respectively. On the present inventors review of the prior art these values of the ME coefficients obtained by these sample structure according to the invention are approximately five times higher than that previously reported for any L T laminates.

While certain embodiments and features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the spirit of the invention.
