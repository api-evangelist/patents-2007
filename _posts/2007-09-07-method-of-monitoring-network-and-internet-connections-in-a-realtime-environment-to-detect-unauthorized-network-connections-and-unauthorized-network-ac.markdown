This application claims benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 824 830 filed Sep. 7 2006 which is herein incorporated in its entirety by reference.

The present invention relates generally to the field of network utility professional programming and more particularly but not exclusively to network communications and methods of intercepting network communications and determining if the connections are authorized or unauthorized in a real time environment.

As networking and automation expands in business and organizations one of the most important new technical capabilities in today s modern network computing is the ability for organizations to establish free local host networks for access to the Internet and other network service providers. In essence organizations are allowing connectivity from their local area network LAN to the Internet and any other public network which can be accessed from the Internet. Many public corporations private corporations state and federal government including the Department Of Defense have established host LAN connection access for employees and visitors to those organizations. As an example it would be very common to walk into a local coffee shop in a medium to large city and for that coffee shop to have free access to a wireless host LAN for access to the Internet.

Another issue is that a 32 64 bit Microsoft computer automatically creates hidden administrative shares for its logical drives C D etc. which it names C D etc. respectively. The 32 64 bit Microsoft computer also creates an Admin hidden share for the WINNT or Windows folder. Domain administrators design these shares for remote access support. By default if these administrative shares are deleted they are automatically recreated when the computer is rebooted. These active administrative shares allow any individual user to remotely log into a 32 64 bit Microsoft computer if the remote user knows the system name and password of that particular computer. What compounds the issue is that an individual who is allowed to access and utilize an organization s host LAN frequently has 100 administrative access rights i.e. privileges to their computer while they are connecting into and utilizing the host LAN. Other shares may also be of issue including but not limited to an ipc share which is a network share that is used to facilitate communication between processes and computers. This share is often used to exchange authentication data between computers.

The issue of establishing host LANs for public connection access is actually a three way problem. It is a problem for the host organization if an individual utilizing the host LAN successfully breaks into an unauthorized area of the host LAN. It is a problem for the individual utilizing the host LAN if an administrator of the host LAN gains unauthorized access to the individual s computer while that individual is utilizing the host LAN. It is a problem for the individual utilizing the host LAN if another individual who is also utilizing the host LAN gains unauthorized access to the other individual s computer while they are both utilizing the host LAN.

The problem becomes much more complicated when an organization attempts to apply the most current common technology solutions available in the industry to combat the problems as defined in the previous paragraphs.

The majority of the current technical solutions for these defined problems are firewalls and intrusion detection systems IDS . The problem with a majority of these technical solutions is that parameters must be defined and applied in the form of policy absolutes without any consideration for allowing any use of logical ports or connections for other legitimate purposes. As an example many personal firewalls simply have one of two possible configurations when installed and configured to function on a networked computer which is either 1 allow i.e. enable other computers to make a direct connection to this computer or 2 disallow i.e. disable the ability for any other computer to make a direct connection to this computer. Unfortunately there is no middle of the road margin for other policy options for connection scenarios. Additionally many personal firewalls either allow a logical port to be opened for use or the logical port must be permanently disabled. Again there is no middle of the road margin for other policy options for logical port scenarios. In summary when available technical solutions can only be applied in the form of policy absolutes these solutions are usually never applied as permanent security solutions in real world operational networks.

While all the previous issues and problems stated are extremely important to the background of this invention one that is more important than all of these issues and problems actually being identified and defined by the information system IS network security industry is commonly referred to as the Inside Threat . Many experts in the IS network security industry believe that the real problem of the Inside Threat has not been solved and will not be solved for some time in the future.

In order to define the exact problem of the Inside Threat it is necessary to understand the fundamental mechanics of network operations and what must happen in order for a network to function as a network.

The fundamental design mechanics of a network requires that a network continuously publicly broadcast information throughout the network in order to actually manage and maintain the operational integrity of the network. The information that is continuously broadcasted includes domain information regarding MAC media access codes Internet Protocol IP addresses device configuration status reporting event signaling etc. One can determine that if a network is required to publicly broadcast this information in order to maintain itself in proper working order then how would it be possible to secure and verify network communications from the Inside Threat if all possible network connectivity is continuously broadcast throughout the network 

In essence this is the actual problem of the Inside Threat because for a network to function the network must broadcast information but at the same time the network is broadcasting information a new technology is needed to protect the network from itself.

In summary the true definition of the Inside Threat is the problem of protecting a network from itself in the course of the network performing its normal network operations.

In order to create a technical solution that will protect the network from itself and resolve the problem of the Inside Threat the solution must be dynamic work in real time conditions and allow network communications to function until such time as an unauthorized event is detected then terminate the event and reestablish the logical port for authorized communications.

As an example a current state of the art Microsoft 32 bit computer or a 64 bit Microsoft computer may be connected to a network i.e. a host LAN which is connected to the Internet which in turn is connected to several other networks. This computer may have a user with administrative privileges and also have tools installed in that computer that allow the user to automatically probe the network to find security holes weaknesses and available passwords to other computers. If the tools are successful in retrieving certain information the user can gain access and log into another computer connected into the same network i.e. host LAN and successfully penetrate and retrieve any information from that computer. Therefore the unauthorized access to another company can be successfully achieved data extracted new programs installed without any knowledge of the unauthorized activity ever known by the host LAN administrators who manage the network. The terms Microsoft PC Microsoft Server Microsoft computer Microsoft 32 bit computer and or any other similar variations and combinations using Microsoft to describe a specific computer device and or server may be used interchangeably to mean a computer device and or server on which a Microsoft operating system O S is implemented.

Because of the problems described in the previous paragraphs a new technology such as for example but not limited to a utility is needed that has the ability to perform an analysis of a 32 64 bit Microsoft personal computer PC or Server from the time the computer is turned on i.e. boots up and that can perform an analysis of a Microsoft computer s internal communications configuration then can configure the computer for secure communications by only allowing direct connections inside the LAN from authorized computers with approved Internet protocol IP addresses. Additionally the solution must configure the network computer to allow the use of all logical communication ports and if an unauthorized event occurs then terminate the event and allow authorized communications to continue on the same logical port.
