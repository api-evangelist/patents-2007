The present invention relates to a bobbin changer apparatus for automatically changing or replacing a bobbin case containing a lower thread bobbin mounted in a rotary hook of a sewing machine.

Lower thread change apparatus are arranged to when a bobbin contained in a bobbin case mounted in a rotary hook supported on a rotary hook base has run out of a lower thread automatically replace the empty bobbin case with a new or replacement bobbin case containing a bobbin with a sufficient supply of lower thread thereon and such lower thread change apparatus have been commonly known as bobbin changers or bobbin changer apparatus e.g. Japanese Patent Application Laid open Publication No. HEI 8 196766 which will hereinafter be referred to as Patent Literature 1 . Further in Japanese Patent Application Laid open Publication No. 2000 157774 hereinafter referred to as Patent Literature 2 there is disclosed a multi head sewing machine equipped with a plurality of machine heads where a bobbin changer is provided for each of the machine heads i.e. for each of rotary hook bases and drive mechanisms of the individual bobbin changers are drivable via a same or common drive source.

In the bobbin changer disclosed in Patent Literature 2 a bobbin stock section or bobbin changing cassette is disposed adjacent to the front end edge of a sewing table closer to a human operator and a transfer mechanism is provided to reciprocally transfer a bobbin grasping device or bobbin chuck mechanism between the rotary hook supported on the rotary hook base located beneath the machine head disposed adjacent to the rear end edge of the sewing table and the bobbin stock section. The bobbin stock section or bobbin changing cassette is equipped with a plurality of bobbin cases and receives and delivers bobbin cases to and from i.e. exchange bobbin cases with the bobbin changer. Namely when a thread wound on a lower thread bobbin mounted in any one of the rotary hooks has run short or run out the bobbin grasping device is moved or transferred via the transfer mechanism to the rotary hook in response to a lower thread runout detection signal takes out from the rotary hook the bobbin case containing the empty bobbin then transferred via the transfer mechanism to the bobbin stock section with the taken out bobbin case grasped by the device and then delivers the bobbin case to an empty bobbin stock position of the bobbin stock section. After that the bobbin stock section is rotated through a predetermined angle to allow the bobbin grasping device to take out a new or replacement bobbin case containing a bobbin with a sufficient supply of lower thread thereon from another bobbin stock position of the bobbin stock section. Then the bobbin grasping device is moved via the transfer mechanism to the rotary hook with the taken out new bobbin case held by the device and places the new bobbin case in the empty rotary hook. Bobbin changing operation is automatically carried out generally in accordance with such an operational sequence.

With the bobbin changer of the type disclosed in Patent Literature 2 the human operator only has to perform operation for retrieving an empty bobbin case from the bobbin stock section provided adjacent to the front end edge of the sewing table machine table and replenishing or resupplying the bobbin stock section with a new bobbin case containing a bobbin having a sufficient supply of lower thread thereon. Thus the bobbin changer disclosed in Patent Literature 2 allows the human operator to perform the necessary operation with considerable ease. On the other hand with the bobbin changer disclosed in Patent Literature 1 where no transfer mechanism is used and the bobbin stock section is disposed near the rotary hook the human operator itself has to manually change a bobbin case in the rotary hook on the rotary hook base by getting under the sewing table which is very troublesome operation. Thus in large size industrial sewing machines not only ordinary industrial sewing machines but also embroidery sewing machines the bobbin changer of the type disclosed in Patent Literature 2 is becoming essential in order to enhance the efficiency of a sewing operation. However the conventionally known bobbin changers have much room for improvement and in fact such improvement has been hoped for over the years.

In the bobbin changer disclosed in Patent Literature 2 for example a guide plate for guiding the movement of the bobbin grasping device has a linear first guide groove and a second groove having orientation changing slanted portions near the opposite ends thereof. By being guided by the orientation changing slanted portions of the second groove the orientation of a chuck section of the bobbin grasping device can be changed at each end of a transfer stroke of the grasping device. Namely the transfer mechanism i.e. guide plate has integrally incorporated therein a mechanism for changing the orientation of the chuck section at the opposite ends of the transfer stroke.

As well known in the art the sewing machines come in variety of sizes depending on for example the range to be embroidered and the distance from the rotary hook bases to the front end edge of the sewing table i.e. from the rotary hooks to the bobbin stock sections also differs depending on the size of the sewing machine. Thus guide plates of various types sizes would be required which correspond to different distances from the rotary hooks to the bobbin stock sections. With the aforementioned conventional technique disclosed in Patent Literature 2 where the guide plate has integrally incorporated therein the mechanisms for changing the orientation of the chuck section at the opposite ends of the transfer stroke it is necessary to separately make such guide plates having integrally incorporated therein the mechanisms for changing the orientation of the chuck section at the opposite ends of the transfer stroke in various sizes and constructions suited for various types of sewing machines which tends to take a lot of time and labor in manufacturing of component parts and therefore results in high cost.

In view of the aforementioned prior art problems WO2005 047586 hereinafter referred to as Patent Literature 3 discloses a more sophisticated bobbin changer apparatus which includes a first orientation change mechanism for during transfer by a transfer mechanism of a bobbin grasping device toward a rotary hook changing the orientation of a chuck section of the bobbin grasping device so that the chuck section faces toward the rotary hook and a second orientation change mechanism for during transfer by the transfer mechanism of the bobbin grasping device toward a bobbin stock section changing the orientation of the chuck section of the bobbin grasping device so that the chuck section faces toward the bobbin stock section. In the bobbin changer apparatus disclosed in Patent Literature 3 the first and second orientation change mechanisms are detachable from the transfer mechanism.

However in each of the bobbin changers disclosed in Patent Literature 2 and Patent Literature 3 where the first and second orientation change mechanisms for orientating the chuck section of the bobbin grasping device toward the rotary hook and bobbin stock section respectively are provided separately there would arise the problems that the overall construction of the bobbin changer apparatus becomes complicated and the number of necessary components increases.

Further because air actuators are used as driving devices for the transfer operation of the transfer mechanism and opening closing operation of the chuck section of the bobbin grasping device in the conventionally known bobbin changer apparatus the drive mechanisms would become extremely complicated in construction and require high cost. Furthermore in the case where the bobbin changer apparatus is applied to a multi head sewing machine equipped with a plurality of machine heads it is difficult to perform control for changing a bobbin of a particular one of a plurality of rotary hooks because one common drive source is shared among the bobbin changer apparatus corresponding to the rotary hooks.

Furthermore in the conventionally known bobbin changer apparatus there have been taken no appropriate measures against errors in bobbin changing operation. In addition the conventionally known bobbin changer apparatus are not constructed to allow a lower thread color change to be effected as desired in the course of sewing of a given sewing pattern.

In view of the foregoing it is an object of the present invention to simplify the construction of an orientation change mechanism in a bobbin changer apparatus of a type which transfers a bobbin case containing a lower thread bobbin between a rotary hook of a sewing machine and a bobbin stock section provided on a machine table adjacent to the front end edge of the machine table remotely from the rotary hook to thereby change the lower thread bobbin.

It is another object of the present invention to provide a bobbin changer apparatus which has drive mechanisms of a simplified construction and which can selectively change a bobbin only in a particular rotary hook with utmost ease.

It is still another object of the present invention to provide a sewing machine which is arranged to take appropriate anti error measures and permits reliable delivery receipt of a bobbin case.

It is still another object of the present invention to provide a sewing machine which allows a lower thread color change to be effected as desired in the course of a sewing operation.

According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an improved bobbin changer apparatus for changing a lower thread bobbin mounted in a rotary hook of a sewing machine by acquiring a replacement bobbin case containing a lower thread bobbin from a bobbin stock section provided apart from the rotary hook which comprises a bobbin grasping device for grasping a bobbin case at a distal end portion of a chuck section a transfer mechanism for reciprocatively transferring the bobbin grasping device between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section and an orientation change mechanism for in a position near one end of a stroke of transfer by the transfer mechanism of the bobbin grasping device i.e. transfer stroke of the bobbin grasping device changing an orientation of the chuck section of the bobbin grasping device being transferred toward the rotary hook so that the chuck section faces toward the rotary hook and changing the orientation of the chuck section of the bobbin grasping device being transferred toward the bobbin stock section so that the chuck section faces toward the bobbin stock section.

According to the preset invention the orientation of the chuck section of the bobbin grasping device can be changed via the single orientation change mechanism near the one end of the transfer stroke of the bobbin grasping device in two directions i.e. in the direction toward the rotary hook and in the direction toward the bobbin stock section thus the preset invention can provide a simplified orientation changing construction with a reduced number of component parts. Further even if the distance between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section i.e. transfer distance over which the bobbin grasping device is transferred changes depending on the type of the sewing machine it is possible to readily deal with such a change in the distance between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section.

According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided an improved bobbin changer apparatus for changing a lower thread bobbin mounted in a rotary hook of a sewing machine by acquiring a replacement bobbin case containing a lower thread bobbin from a bobbin stock section provided on a machine table adjacent to the front end edge of the machine table remotely from the rotary hook which comprises a bobbin grasping device for grasping a bobbin case at a distal end portion of a chuck section a transfer mechanism for reciprocatively transferring the bobbin grasping device between the bobbin stock section and the rotary hook and an orientation changing motor mounted on the bobbin grasping device for pivoting the chuck section to thereby selectively cause the chuck section to face toward the rotary hook and cause the chuck section to face toward the bobbin stock section.

By the orientation changing motor mounted on the bobbin grasping device the orientation of the chuck section can be changed in two directions i.e. in the direction toward the rotary hook and in the direction toward the bobbin stock section thus the preset invention can provide a simplified orientation changing construction with a reduced number of component parts. Further even if the distance between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section i.e. transfer distance over which the bobbin grasping device is transferred changes depending on the type of the sewing machine it is possible to readily deal with such a change in the distance between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section.

In a preferred embodiment as an actuator for selectively performing a grasp operation for causing the chuck section in an empty state to grasp a bobbin case and a release operation for releasing a bobbin case from the chuck section a driving motor of the transfer mechanism is provided independently for each of the rotary hooks to which a plurality of the bobbin changer apparatus correspond. Further in the case where the bobbin stock section is provided for each of the rotary hooks the bobbin stock section provided for each of the rotary hooks may include a plurality of bobbin holding portions a selection mechanism for selectively positioning any one of the bobbin holding portions at a predetermined bobbin changing position and an independent motor for driving the selection mechanism. Thus as compared to the conventional bobbin changer apparatus where air cylinders are driven by a common air power supply the present invention can significantly simplify the construction of the drive mechanisms. Further with the independent motors employed for the individual rotary hooks it is possible implement a bobbin change replacement only for a particular one of the rotary hooks.

According to still another aspect of the present invention there is provided an improved sewing machine which comprises a bobbin stock section for holding replacement bobbin cases the bobbin stock section including a plurality of bobbin holding portions a selection mechanism for selectively positioning any one of the bobbin holding portions at a predetermined bobbin changing position and a detection section for detecting whether or not a bobbin case is currently held by the bobbin holding portion positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position a bobbin changer apparatus for changing a lower thread bobbin mounted in a rotary hook of the sewing machine the bobbin changer apparatus including a bobbin grasping device for grasping a bobbin case at a distal end portion of a chuck section and a transfer mechanism for reciprocatively transferring the bobbin grasping device between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section a control section for halting transfer by the transfer mechanism of the bobbin grasping device toward the bobbin stock section once the detection section detects that a bobbin case is currently held by the bobbin holding portion positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position when the bobbin case grasped by the bobbin grasping device is to be passed to the bobbin holding portion positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position and for halting transfer by the transfer mechanism of the bobbin grasping device toward the bobbin stock section once the detection section detects that no bobbin case is currently held by the bobbin holding portion positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position when the bobbin grasping device is transferred toward the bobbin holding portion positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position in order to receive a bobbin case from the bobbin holding portion positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position.

Namely in the bobbin stock section the detection section is provided for detecting whether or not a bobbin case is currently held by the bobbin holding portion positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position and in accordance with a result of the detection by the detection section the control section performs control for halting the transfer by the transfer mechanism of the bobbin grasping device toward the bobbin stock section. Such arrangements can prevent a mechanical damage from occurring by the bobbin grasping device being transferred to pass a bobbin case to the bobbin holding portion positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position when another bobbin case is currently held by the bobbin holding portion positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position thereby reliably preventing erroneous operation. The above described arrangements of the invention can also prevent the possibility that although no bobbin case is currently held at the predetermined bobbin changing position the bobbin grasping device may be transferred to the predetermined bobbin changing position in order to receive a bobbin case from the predetermined bobbin changing position and then returned to the rotary hook with no replacement bobbin case grasped thereby. In this way the bobbin changer apparatus can be controlled to perform reliable delivery receipt of bobbin cases i.e. exchange of bobbin cases between the bobbin stock section and the rotary hook.

According to still another aspect of the present invention there is provided an improved sewing machine for performing sewing with an upper thread passed through a sewing needle and a lower thread paid out from a bobbin mounted in a rotary book which comprises a bobbin stock section holding at least two bobbin cases containing lower threads of different characteristics the bobbin stock section positioning a selected one of the bobbin cases at a predetermined bobbin changing position a bobbin grasping device having a chuck section for grasping a bobbin case a transfer mechanism for transferring the bobbin grasping device between the bobbin stock section and the rotary hook and a lower thread change control section for in response to a lower thread change signal performing control such that a bobbin case is taken out from the rotary hook by the bobbin grasping device the bobbin grasping device with the bobbin case taken out from the rotary hook is transferred by the transfer mechanism to the bobbin stock section a new bobbin case is positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position of the bobbin stock section the new bobbin case is grasped by the bobbin grasping device and then the bobbin grasping device with the new bobbin case grasped thereby is transferred by the transfer mechanism to the rotary hook.

In the sewing machine thus arranged the bobbin case set in the rotary hook can be changed with a new bobbin case in response to a lower thread change signal thus a bobbin case containing a lower thread of a suitable characteristic corresponding to the lower thread change signal can be set into the rotary hook as needed which allows a lower thread change to be implemented as desired in the course of a sewing operation.

According to still another aspect of the present invention there is provided an improved sewing machine for performing sewing with an upper thread passed through a sewing needle and a lower thread paid out from a bobbin mounted in a rotary book which comprises a bobbin stock section holding at least two bobbin cases containing lower threads the bobbin stock section positioning a selected one of the bobbin cases at a predetermined bobbin changing position a bobbin grasping device having a chuck section for grasping a bobbin case and a transfer mechanism for transferring the bobbin grasping device between the bobbin stock section and the rotary hook the bobbin stock section including a bobbin holder unit having a plurality of bobbin holding portions each for holding a bobbin case and a mechanism having a moving member the mechanism detachably attaching the bobbin holder unit to the moving member and positioning one of the bobbin holding portions of the attached bobbin holder unit at the predetermined bobbin changing position by moving the moving member.

With such a sewing machine where the bobbin holder unit having a plurality of bobbin holding portions is detachably attached to the moving member a plurality of bobbin cases can be set onto the bobbin stock section collectively in a short time so that the operating efficiency can be significantly enhanced.

According to still another aspect of the present invention there is provided an improved bobbin changer apparatus for changing a lower thread bobbin mounted in a rotary hook by acquiring a replacement bobbin case containing a lower thread bobbin from a bobbin stock section which comprises a bobbin grasping device for grasping a bobbin case at a distal end portion of a chuck section and a transfer mechanism for reciprocatively transferring the bobbin grasping device between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section the bobbin grasping device including the chuck section for selectively performing a grasp operation for grasping a bobbin case and a release operation for releasing a bobbin case a support section for supporting the chuck section in such a manner that the chuck section is slidable within a predetermined range the support section being transferable by the transfer mechanism and a spring member for normally biasing the chuck section supported by the support section toward a bobbin case the chuck section being slidable relative to the support section within the predetermined range in accordance with resiliency of the spring member.

Because the chuck section supported by the support section is normally biased by the spring member toward the bobbin case the chuck section can be resiliently pressed against the bobbin case when the bobbin case is difficult to grasp so that the bobbin case can be reliably grasped by the chuck section. When the bobbin case is passed to i.e. released toward the rotary hook or bobbin stock section on the other hand even if the support section is moved by the transfer mechanism away from the rotary hook or bobbin stock section after having released the bobbin case the bobbin case can be reliably passed to the rotary hook or bobbin stock section because the chuck section keeps pressing the bobbin case for some time i.e. over the predetermined range the chuck section slides relative to the support section .

According to still another aspect of the present invention there is provided an improved sewing machine including a plurality of machine heads and a bobbin stock section and bobbin changer apparatus provided for each of rotary hooks corresponding to the machine heads each of the bobbin changer apparatus changing a lower thread bobbin mounted in the rotary hook by acquiring a replacement bobbin case containing a lower thread bobbin from the bobbin stock section corresponding thereto each of the bobbin changer apparatus including a mode selection switch operable to select a bobbin changing operation mode a switch operable to instruct execution of a bobbin changing operation in accordance with the bobbin changing operation mode selected via the mode selection switch and a display for displaying a state of the bobbin changer apparatus.

With the provision of the mode selection switch bobbin changing operation execution instructing switch and state displaying display a human operator can instruct a necessary mode selection bobbin changing operation etc. after having checked via the display a current state of the bobbin changer apparatus and thus an enhanced operability can be achieved.

The following will describe embodiments of the present invention but it should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the described embodiments and various modifications of the invention are possible without departing from the basic principles. The scope of the present invention is therefore to be determined solely by the appended claims.

The following paragraphs describe the embodiment of the bobbin changer apparatus with reference to . and are a right side view left side view and bottom view respectively of the bobbin changer apparatus rotary hook base and bobbin stock section and is a sectional view taken along the A A line of .

As shown in the bobbin changer apparatus includes a bobbin grasping device for grasping and transferring a bobbin case B the above mentioned transfer section for transferring the bobbin grasping device between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section and an orientation change mechanism i.e. section denoted at and for changing the orientation of the bobbin grasping device during transfer by the transfer section of the bobbin grasping device . The bobbin grasping device includes a chuck device for grasping a bobbin case B at its distal end portion and a moving member pivotally supporting the chuck device .

The transfer section includes a pair of upper and lower guide bars extending horizontally between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section and the moving member of the bobbin grasping device is slidably supported on the two guide bars . Each of the guide bars is disposed between a first bracket via which the bobbin changer apparatus is fixed to the underside of the machine table and a second bracket fixed to the rotary hook base . Further the guide bars are disposed substantially in parallel to the machine table and removably attached by means of mounting screws.

As shown in a driving pulley and driven pulley are supported on the first bracket and second bracket respectively and a timing belt is wound on and extends between the driving pulley and the driven pulley . Lower straight traveling portion of the timing belt extends along a side of the lower guide bar and a lower portion of the moving member is coupled to the lower straight traveling portion by means of a coupling member .

As seen in the driving pulley is connected to a motor shaft of a motor fixed to the first bracket and the moving member is driven by forward and reverse driving of the motor to move in a front rear direction of the sewing machine thus the bobbin grasping device provided with the chuck device is transferred between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section . Note that the transferring motor is provided separately for each of the bobbin changer apparatus corresponding to the rotary hooks . Therefore as compared to the conventional bobbin changer apparatus where air cylinders are driven by a common air power supply the instant embodiment can significantly simplify the construction of the drive mechanisms. Further with the independent motor provided for each of the rotary hooks it is possible to drive only the transfer section corresponding to a particular one of the machine heads so that a bobbin case change can be implemented easily only for the rotary hook.

As shown in a support shaft extending horizontally at a right angle to the guide bars is rotatably supported on the moving member of the bobbin grasping device . Support arm is fixed to one projecting end of the support shaft and the chuck device is supported on the support arm . In this manner the chuck device is pivotally supported by the moving member .

First with reference to as well as and a description will be given about details of the chuck device . is an enlarged bottom view of the chuck device which also shows a bobbin case B in order to explain behavior of the chuck device when grasping the bobbin case B. The chuck device includes a holding member for catching and holding a bobbin case B a claw for pulling out a knob B of the bobbin case B and a linear motor for opening and closing the claw . As seen in the holding member has at its distal end edge an engagement portion for receiving the bobbin case B and it pivotably supports the claw via a pin . Actuating lever is coupled to the claw via the pin and these elements and can be caused to pivot together.

The linear motor is mounted via a bracket on the support arm supporting the holding member and a linearly moving rod of the linear motor has its distal end facing the actuating lever so that the rod when it is in its projecting position can push the actuating lever . The actuating lever and claw are normally biased by a torsion spring in a clockwise direction of so that its free end is normally held in abutment against the distal end of the linearly moving rod of the linear motor as indicated by a solid line in the figure . As the linearly moving rod projects through activation of the linear motor the actuating lever is caused to pivot in the counterclockwise direction so that the claw also pivots to pull out the knob B of the bobbin case B. As well known by the knob B of the bobbin case B being pulled out the bobbin case B is released from retention by a bobbin case holding device such as the rotary hook or bobbin stock section but also can reliably hold the bobbin therein against accidental dropping from the case B.

When a grasp operation i.e. chucking operation is to be performed for causing the chuck device in its empty state to grasp a bobbin case B the chuck device is moved close to the bobbin case B held by the bobbin case holding device such as the rotary hook or bobbin stock section . Then after the engagement portion of the holding member abuts against the front surface of the bobbin case B the linearly moving rod is advanced through activation of the linear motor to a position indicated by an imaginary line in so as to cause the claw and actuating lever as indicated by imaginary lines in . During that time the knob B of the bobbin case B is pulled out by the pivoting movement of the claw . The chucking operation is completed when the knob B has been pressed via the claw against a receiving portion of the holding member by that time the front surface of the bobbin case B has also been received by the engagement portion of the holding member . The chuck device can keep grasping the bobbin case B by the linearly moving rod of the linear motor being maintained in the projecting state.

 release operation for releasing the bobbin case B grasped by the chuck device is performed in accordance with an operational sequence opposite to the above mentioned operational sequence of the grasp operation i.e. chucking . Namely the chuck device with the bobbin case B grasped thereby is moved close to the bobbin case holding device such as the empty rotary hook or bobbin stock section and the linearly moving rod of the linear motor is retracted to the position indicated by the solid line in after the bobbin case B has been passed to the bobbin case holding device. Thus the actuating lever and claw pivot in the clockwise direction from the imaginary line positions of to the solid line positions of so that the knob B having so far been pulled out is returned to the original or retracted position. In this manner the bobbin case B is released from the chuck device .

In the bobbin grasping device as seen in and an actuating member a type of cam is fixed to the other end of the support shaft which projects in an opposite direction from the end of the shaft having the support arm chuck device mounted thereto thus the actuating member and the chuck device are pivotable together. Further a torsion spring see is fitted over the support shaft between the moving member and the support arm . Via the torsion spring the support shaft actuating member and chuck device are normally biased in the clockwise direction of counterclockwise direction of . Stopper pin is provided on and projects from a predetermined position of the moving member and the chuck device is held in a posture as shown in by a predetermined portion i.e. engaging arm of the actuating member abutting against the stopper pin . Direction in which the bobbin grasping device is transferred by the transfer section toward the bobbin stock section i.e. direction of arrow F in will hereinafter be referred to as first direction and the chuck device shown in is oriented i.e. faces in the first direction . Namely by the biasing force of the torsion spring and engaging force of the stopper pin the chuck device is normally oriented in the first direction . Further a direction in which the bobbin grasping device is transferred by the transfer section toward the rotary hook i.e. direction of arrow R in will hereinafter be referred to as second direction .

Orientation changing mechanism is provided in a predetermined position of a stroke of transfer by the transfer section the bobbin grasping device i.e. near one end of the transfer stroke adjacent to the rotary hook base in the illustrated example of . Namely as illustrated in the support plate is fixed to the second bracket secured to the rotary hook base and engaging pins projections and are provided on the support plate the engaging pins projections and project from the support plate by appropriate amounts in the direction perpendicular to the guide bars . The engaging pins projections and project in such a manner that only the actuating member of the bobbin grasping device moving along the guide bars engage with the engaging pins projections and . In the instant embodiment the actuating member includes first and second engaging arms and extending at respective predetermined angles with respect to the support arm of the chuck device namely the first and second engaging arms and together form a substantial L shape. Normally the first engaging arm extends upwardly in a substantial vertical direction while the second engaging arm extends horizontally as seen in . The above mentioned engaging pins projections and are spaced apart from each other on the support plate near the one end of the transfer stroke so that they sequentially engage with the first and second engaging arms and traveling in the second direction R.

As the bobbin grasping device moves in the second direction R from the position indicated in toward the rotary hook base to reach the orientation change mechanism section where the engaging pins and are provided the first engaging arm of the actuating member abuts against the first engaging pin . Following the abutment of the first engaging arm as the bobbin grasping device further moves in the second direction R the actuating member pivots in the counterclockwise direction against the biasing force of the torsion spring in response to which the chuck device too pivots in the counterclockwise direction. In response to the pivoting movement of the chuck device the second engaging arm having so far lied horizontally starts moving upward so that the distal end free end of the arm gets to a region between the first and second engaging pins and and then arrives at a position where it can abut and engage with the second engaging pin as shown in . Then as the bobbin grasping device further moves in the second direction R the abutment between the first engaging arm and the first engaging pin is canceled and then the actuating member and chuck device further pivots in the counterclockwise direction by the engagement between the second engaging arm and the second engaging pin as shown in .

Then once the bobbin grasping device further moving in the second direction R reaches a position where the actuating member no longer pivots in the counterclockwise direction 180 inversion i.e. orientation change of the chuck device is completed i.e. the chuck device has been placed in a state where its distal end is oriented i.e. faces in the second direction R i.e. toward the rotary hook as shown in . In the orientation change completed position the engagement portion of the holding member of the chuck device is in alignment with at the same height as the front of the bobbin case B mounted in the rotary hook and a positioning pin projecting from a predetermined position of the chuck device has reached an opening of a guide groove of a guide member fixed to the second bracket . is a right side view corresponding to a state of which shows the bobbin changer apparatus rotary hook base and bobbin stock section .

As the bobbin grasping device further moves in the second direction R the abutting engagement between the second engaging arm and the second engaging pin is canceled but the positioning pin fits into the guide groove of the guide member and the chuck device is maintained in the posture where it is oriented i.e. faces in the second direction R i.e. toward the rotary hook . The guide groove of the guide member extends in parallel to the guide bars and the posture of the chuck device does not change after the positioning pin fits into the guide groove of the guide member . Then when the moving member of the bobbin grasping device has been stopped by abutting against a stopper S positionally adjustably mounted on the guide bar the chuck device is now in a state where it can pass or receive a bobbin case B to or from the rotary hook . Namely when a bobbin case B is to be received from the rotary hook the engagement portion of the holding member of the chuck device abuts against the front surface of the bobbin case B mounted in the rotary hook . When a bobbin case B is to be passed to the rotary hook on the other hand the bobbin case B grasped by the chuck device is reliably inserted into the rotary hook . In the state shown in the linear motor is controlled so that the above mentioned grasp operation is performed when a bobbin case B is to be received from the rotary hook while the above mentioned release operation is performed when a bobbin case B is to be passed to the rotary hook .

When the bobbin grasping device located in the position shown in is to be transferred in the first direction F i.e. toward the bobbin stock section the aforementioned operational sequence of is reversed during which time the actuating member and chuck device are caused to pivot in the clockwise direction by the biasing force of the torsion spring . When the second engaging arm has abutted against the stopper pin the actuating member is placed in a state where it no longer pivots in the clockwise direction even if the bobbin grasping device further moves in the first direction F so that 180 inversion i.e. orientation change of the chuck device is completed i.e. the chuck device has been placed in a state where its distal end is oriented in the first direction F i.e. toward the bobbin stock section as shown in . After that the bobbin grasping device is transferred in the first direction F toward the bobbin stock section with the chuck device kept in the posture where the device is oriented i.e. faces in the first direction F i.e. toward the bobbin stock section .

Namely according to the instant embodiment the orientation of the chuck device of the bobbin grasping device can be changed via the single orientation change mechanism provided in the predetermined one position i.e. section where the engaging pins and are provided in the transfer stroke both in the direction toward the rotary hook and in the direction toward the bobbin stock section thus the instant embodiment can provide a simplified orientation changing construction with a reduced number of component parts. Further even if the distance between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section i.e. transfer distance over which the bobbin grasping device is transferred changes depending on the type of the sewing machine it is only necessary to change the length of the guide bars thus it is possible to readily deal with such a change in the specifications. Note that the orientation change mechanism i.e. section where the engaging pins and are provided may be disposed near the other end of the transfer stroke adjacent to the bobbin stock section rather than at the aforementioned end of the transfer stroke adjacent to the rotary hook .

In the embodiment shown in the bobbin stock section includes a holding block having four bobbin holding portions H provided at 90 angular intervals for holding one bobbin case B each and a driving motor for driving a drive shaft supporting thereon the holding block . As shown in the drive shaft is supported by a base that is in turn fixed to the first bracket . The drive shaft is connected to the driving motor and the driving motor is fixed to the base via a base member and stud . Further a positioning cam is fixed to the drive shaft .

As the rod is retracted as indicated by an imaginary line in by activation energization of the solenoid the pivot lever pivots in the clockwise direction so that the engaging pin disengages from the engaging recessed portion and thus the locking of the positioning cam is canceled. During that time any one of the bobbin holding portions H can be selectively positioned at a predetermined bobbin changing position by the drive shaft being caused to pivot in 90 degrees by the driving motor . For example when a bobbin case B is to be received from the bobbin grasping device it is only necessary that an empty bobbin holding portion H currently having no bobbin case B held thereby be selectively positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position. Further when a bobbin case B containing a desired lower thread bobbin is to be passed from the stock section to the bobbin grasping device it is only necessary that one of the bobbin holding portions H having held thereby the bobbin case B containing a desired lower thread bobbin be selectively positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position. Note that the bobbin selecting driving motor is provided separately for each of the bobbin changer apparatus corresponding to the rotary hooks . Thus as compared to the conventional bobbin changer apparatus where air cylinders are driven by a common air power supply the instant embodiment can significantly simplify the drive mechanisms. Further with the motor provided separately per rotary hook a desired lower thread can be selected per rotary hook so that the color of the lower thread can be changed per machine head. In the present invention lower threads of same characteristics e.g. white cotton threads may be contained in the plurality of bobbin cases B held by the bobbin stock section as in the conventional bobbin changer apparatus or lower threads of different characteristics may be contained in the plurality of bobbin cases B.

 Detection of Presence Absence of Bobbin Case on the Bobbin Stock Section and Control Based on the Detection 

The above mentioned predetermined bobbin changing position is where the bobbin holding portion H faces the chuck device of the bobbin grasping device transferred by the transfer section so that delivery receipt of a bobbin case B can be implemented by the chuck device . In order to take safety measures and reliable delivery receipt of the bobbin case B the bobbin stock section has a microswitch provided thereon for detecting whether or not a bobbin case B is currently held by i.e. present at the bobbin holding portion H located at the predetermined bobbin changing position. The microswitch includes a detection piece that advances or retracts depending on whether or not a bobbin case B is currently held by the bobbin holding portion H located at the predetermined bobbin changing position. Namely when a bobbin case B is currently held by the bobbin holding portion H located at the predetermined bobbin changing position the detection piece retracts by abutting against the bobbin case B so that the detection piece is turned on. When no bobbin case B is currently held by the bobbin holding portion H located at the predetermined bobbin changing position on the other hand the detection piece advances so that the detection piece is turned off.

If a NO determination has been made at step S i.e. it has been determined that no bobbin case B is currently held by the bobbin holding portion H located at the predetermined bobbin changing position the control device branches to step S where a further determination is made as to whether the current transfer of the bobbin grasping device toward the bobbin stock section is for the bobbin grasping device to pass a bobbin case B to the bobbin stock section . If a YES determination has been made at step S it means that the bobbin changer apparatus is currently operating normally and thus the control flow proceeds to step S in order to continue the bobbin case passing operation. If a NO determination has been made at step S on the other hand it means that the bobbin changer apparatus is currently operating abnormally because no bobbin case B is currently held by the bobbin holding portion H located at the predetermined bobbin changing position although the current transfer of the bobbin grasping device toward the bobbin stock section is for the bobbin grasping device to receive a bobbin case B from the bobbin stock section . Therefore the control flow branches from step S to step S in order to temporarily stop or halt the transfer by the transfer section of the bobbin grasping device after which the control flow proceeds to step S. At step S the control devices warns the human operator. In this way the human operator can take necessary action for removing the abnormality such as causing another bobbin holding portion H with no bobbin case B to be positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position. At next step S the control device checks whether or not the abnormality has been removed. If so the control device resumes the transfer of the bobbin grasping device to carry on with the operation that was being performed immediately before the stoppage of the transfer.

The above described arrangements can prevent a mechanical damage from occurring by the bobbin grasping device being transferred to pass a bobbin case B to the bobbin stock section when a bobbin case B is currently held at the predetermined bobbin changing position thereby securing safety. The above described arrangements can also prevent the possibility that although no bobbin case B is currently held at the predetermined bobbin changing position the bobbin grasping device may be transferred to receive a bobbin case B from the predetermined bobbin changing position and then returned to the rotary hook with no replacement bobbin case B thus the bobbin changer apparatus can be controlled to perform reliable delivery receipt of a bobbin case B.

The bobbin grasping device is normally held at a standby position a little away from the bobbin stock section toward the rotary hook base . Upon detecting that the lower thread in the bobbin case mounted in the rotary hook has run out the transfer of the bobbin grasping device is started. First the bobbin grasping device is transferred toward the rotary hook in the second direction R the bobbin case B mounted in the rotary hook is chucked by the chuck device . Then the bobbin grasping device is transferred toward the bobbin stock section in the first direction F and once the bobbin grasping device reaches the bobbin stock section it passes the bobbin case B being held thereby to an empty bobbin holding portion H of the bobbin stock section . If at that time a bobbin case B is currently set at i.e. held by the bobbin holding portion H the bobbin case B grasped by the chuck device will undesirably interfere with the bobbin case B held by the chuck device . Thus when it has been determined on the basis of the ON OFF state of the microswitch that a bobbin case B is currently held by the bobbin holding portion H the transfer of the bobbin grasping device is stopped and the human operator is warned of the presence of the bobbin case B at the bobbin holding portion H so that the human operator can remove the abnormality as set forth above.

After the bobbin case B having run out of the lower thread has been passed to the bobbin stock section not only the chuck device is retracted a little toward the rotary hook but also the holding block of the bobbin stock section is rotated through 90 degrees so that a bobbin case containing a bobbin loaded with a lower thread is positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position. If it has then been determined on the basis of the ON OFF state of the microswitch that no bobbin case B is currently held by the bobbin holding portion H located at the predetermined bobbin changing position the transfer of the chuck device is temporarily stopped and the human operator is warned of the absence of a bobbin case B so that the human operator can remove the abnormality as set forth above. If on the other hand it has been determined on the basis of the ON OFF state of the microswitch that a bobbin case B is currently held by the bobbin holding portion H the chuck device is further transferred toward the bobbin stock section and the bobbin case B held by the bobbin holding portion H is chucked by the chuck device .

The position where the chuck device is to be stopped upon arrival at the bobbin stock section is controlled by the moving member abutting against a stopper S positionally adjustably provided on the lower guide bar in generally the same manner as when the chuck device transferred toward the rotary hook base is to be stopped. Further when the chuck device has arrived at the bobbin stock section it can be held in a stable posture by the positioning pin of the chuck device fits into a guide groove of a guide member provided on the first bracket .

After the chuck device has received a new i.e. replacement bobbin case B from the bobbin stock section it is transferred toward the rotary hook base in the second direction R and passes the new bobbin case B to the rotary hook . After that the chuck device is returned to the above mentioned standby position in this way one bobbin changing operation cycle is completed.

Alternatively a bobbin case change may be implemented at any other suitable time than when the lower thread of the bobbin case B mounted in the rotary hook has run out. For example a bobbin case change may be implemented automatically when the number of embroidering stitches has reached a preset value or may be implemented as needed in accordance with a manual operation instruction from the human operator or the like.

Other structural details of the bobbin grasping device in the instant embodiment are similar to those in the above described embodiment. Namely the torsion spring is fitted over the support shaft between the moving member and the support arm . Via the torsion spring the support shaft and the actuating member and chuck device are normally biased in the clockwise direction of . Stopper pin is provided on and projects from a predetermined position of the moving member and the chuck device is normally held in a predetermined posture oriented in the first direction F i.e. in a posture where the cam is raised as shown in by a predetermined portion of the actuating member abutting against the stopper pin .

Once the bobbin grasping device arrives at a position indicated in by being transferred away from the bobbin stock section in the second direction R the cam surface of the actuating member abuts against the engaging pin . After the abutment as the bobbin grasping device is further transferred in the second direction R with the abutting engagement between the cam surface and the engaging pin maintained the actuating member pivots in the counterclockwise direction against the biasing force of the torsion spring in response to which the chuck device too pivots in the counterclockwise direction.

Because of the shape of the cam surface when the actuating member has reached a position where it no longer pivots in the clockwise direction even if the bobbin grasping device further moves in the second direction R 180 inversion i.e. orientation change of the chuck device is completed i.e. the chuck device has been placed in a state where its distal end is oriented i.e. faces in the second direction R i.e. toward the rotary hook as shown in . In the orientation change completed position the engagement portion of the holding member of the chuck device is in alignment with at the same height as the front of the bobbin case B mounted in the rotary hook as in the above described embodiment. Further the positioning pin projecting from a predetermined position of the chuck device has reached the opening of the guide groove of the guide member fixed to the second bracket . As the bobbin grasping device further moves in the second direction R the positioning pin fits into the guide groove of the guide member and the chuck device is maintained in the posture where it is oriented in the second direction R i.e. toward the rotary hook even after the engagement between the cam surface and the engaging pin is canceled. Then when the moving member of the bobbin grasping device has been stopped by abutting against the stopper S positionally adjustably mounted on the guide bar the chuck device is now in a state where it can pass or receive a bobbin case B to or from the rotary hook .

When the bobbin grasping device is to be transferred in the first direction F toward the bobbin stock section from the position facing the rotary hook the aforementioned operational sequence of is reversed during which time the actuating member and chuck device are caused to pivot in the clockwise direction by the biasing force of the torsion spring . When a predetermined position of the actuating member has abutted against the stopper pin as shown in the actuating member is placed in a state where it no longer pivots in the clockwise direction even if the bobbin grasping device further moves in the first direction F so that 180 inversion i.e. orientation change of the chuck device is completed i.e. the chuck device has been placed in a state where its distal end is oriented in the first direction F i.e. toward the bobbin stock section . After that the bobbin grasping device is transferred in the first direction F toward the bobbin stock section with the chuck device kept in the posture where the device is oriented in the first direction F i.e. toward the bobbin stock section .

In the above described embodiments the claw of the chuck device is integrally coupled with the actuating lever via the pin so that these elements and are always caused to pivot together. However the present invention is not so limited and the chuck device may be constructed in a manner as shown in . a of is a perspective view showing a modification of the chuck device and b of is an exploded perspective view showing a modification of the chuck device .

In the modification of the chuck device shown in the actuating lever is fixed to a pin T intercoupling the claw and the actuating lever but the claw is fitted over the pin T in such a manner that it is pivotable relative to the pin T. As clearly seen from b of the claw is rotatably fitted over a shaft portion of the pin T. Further the claw is normally biased by a torsion spring provided between a flange formed on the pin T and the claw and the pivoting movement of the claw is restricted by the claw abutting against a stopper . Similarly to the torsion spring shown in the torsion spring is provided for returning the claw and actuating lever to a predetermined posture. In the instant modification the claw whose pivoting movement is restricted by abutment against the stopper is caused to pivot relative to the pin T by the linearly moving rod of the linear motor being projected by activation of the linear motor so that the claw fully pulls out the knob B of the bobbin case B and then the linearly moving rod being further projected. Consequently the claw will resiliently hold the knob B of the bobbin case B through a resilient restoring force of the torsion spring .

The following paragraphs describe an embodiment of the sewing machine where lower thread change control is performed in accordance with the principles of the present invention.

In the case where each of the needle bar cases in contains 12 twelve needle bars embroidery using embroidering threads upper threads of up to 12 twelve colors is permitted through needle bar selection by sliding movement of the needle bar case . With the conventionally known techniques on the other hand no lower thread color change corresponding to sewing data could not be implemented so that a lower thread of only one color normally white cotton thread was used thus the reverse sides of embroidery products where the lower thread appears tend to be uninteresting or unattractive.

In view of the inconvenience presented by the conventional known techniques the present invention proposes a novel sewing machine which allows a lower thread color change to be implemented as desired in the course of a sewing operation. Thus with the sewing machine of the present invention an embroidery pattern interesting or attractive to a considerable degree can also be formed on the reverse side of an embroidering fabric with lower threads of various colors. Further threads different in color from upper threads or needle threads may be used as lower threads in which case too a color pattern interesting or attractive to a considerable degree can also be formed on the reverse side of an embroidering fabric by implementing a lower thread color change as necessary thus the present invention can manufacture interesting or attractive embroidery products that have heretofore been impossible to manufacture. Whereas the following paragraphs describe lower thread color change control the present invention is not limited to the lower thread color change and it can perform control for changing a currently used lower thread to another lower thread differing from the currently used lower thread in characteristic such as a thickness material or stretching property.

With a YES determination at step S operations of steps S and S are performed. Namely at step S the operation of the sewing machine is stopped temporarily and the bobbin grasping device is transferred in the second direction R and caused to perform the grasp operation for taking out the bobbin case B from the rotary hook as set forth above. Then the bobbin grasping device is transferred in the first direction F and caused to perform the release operation at the predetermined bobbin changing position of the bobbin stock section for passing the bobbin case B to the bobbin stock section . Because this routine is intended to implement a lower thread change it does not necessarily matter whether the lower thread in the bobbin case B mounted in the rotary hook has run short or not.

At step S a bobbin case B containing the lower thread of the desired characteristic e.g. color is selected in the bobbin stock section in accordance with the lower thread designating data included in the lower thread change signal read out as the current control event and the thus selected bobbin case B is positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position. The bobbin grasping device is transferred in the first direction R and caused to perform the grasp operation to take out the bobbin case B from the predetermined bobbin changing position of the bobbin stock section and grab the taken out bobbin case B as set forth above. Then the bobbin grasping device is transferred in the second direction R and caused to perform the release operation in front of the rotary hook for passing the bobbin case B to the rotary hook .

The construction of the bobbin stock section is not limited to the one in the above described embodiments and may be modified variously. Particularly in order to permit changes among lower threads of various characteristics e.g. colors it is desirable that the number of bobbin cases B capable of being held by the bobbin stock section be greater for example it is desirable that the number of the bobbin cases B capable of being held by the bobbin stock section be about the same as the number of the needle bars contained in the needle bar case of the upper threads. Further if a lower thread replenishing bobbin change responsive to detection of a lower thread shortage too is taken into account it is preferable that the bobbin stock section be capable of holding a greater number of bobbin cases B with a small size construction. Modifications of the bobbin stock section constructed from such a perspective will be described with reference to .

 a of is a schematic plan view showing a modified bobbin stock section and rotary hook corresponding thereto. In the figure a one dot dash line K schematically shows a movement or transfer path of the chuck device between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section . b of is a right side view of a bobbin stock section slightly different in construction from the bobbin stock section shown in a of . Reference numeral indicates a single common operating shaft provided for shared use among all of the bobbin stock sections corresponding to the rotary hooks and the common operating shaft extends along almost the entire width of the machine table under the lower surface of a front end edge portion of the machine table . Mounting blocks are fixed to the operating shaft in correspondence with the individual rotary hooks . Holding member for holding a plurality of bobbin cases B side by side in a row in a longitudinal direction of the operating shaft is detachably attached to each of the mounting blocks . In a of one of the plurality of bobbin cases B held on the holding member is located at the predetermined bobbin changing position i.e. position on the one dot dash line K where the one bobbin case B can be chucked by the chuck device . The operating shaft is connected at its one end to a not shown drive device so that the shaft can be driven to linearly slide in an axial direction of the shaft in distances equal to intervals between the bobbin cases B held side by side on the holding member and can be rotated about its axis. The linear sliding driving of the operating shaft may be linked to the sliding driving of the needle bar case .

In the illustrated example of a of only one holding member one row of bobbin cases B is attached to the mounting block . But the present invention is not so limited and a plurality of holding members may be attached to the mounting block at angular intervals e.g. 90 intervals about the operating shaft as shown in b of . For example three holding members each holding four bobbin cases B may be attached to the mounting block as shown in b of in which case a total of 12 twelve bobbin cases B can be held by the bobbin stock section . This means that lower thread changes among 12 different colors is permitted per machine head in correspondence with the construction i.e. needle bar case containing 12 needles that permits upper thread changes among 12 different colors. In the illustrated example of b of one of the bobbin cases B which contains a lower thread of a desired color contained therein can be positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position or an empty holding position with no bobbin case B can be positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position by rotationally and linearly driving the operating shaft . The present invention is of course not so limited and the number of bobbin cases B linearly held on each holding member and the number of holding members provided at predetermined angular intervals about the operating shaft may be set as desired.

In the illustrated example of a of the holding member can be oriented in the forward direction of the machine table i.e. toward the human operator operating the machine by rotating the operating shaft through 180 degrees. By thus orienting the holding member in the forward direction of the machine table the human operator can perform with utmost ease manual operation for changing the holding member or changing any of the bobbin cases B on the holding member .

 a of is a schematic plan view showing another modified bobbin stock section and rotary hook corresponding thereto. In this figure too a one dot dash line K schematically shows a movement path of the chuck device between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section . b of is a right side view of the bobbin stock section . In the illustrated examples of too a single common operating shaft provided for shared use among all of the bobbin stock sections corresponding to the rotary hooks extends along almost the entire width of the machine table under the lower surface of a front end edge portion of the machine table . Cylindrical holding blocks are mounted on the operating shaft in corresponding relation to the rotary hooks and each of the cylindrical holding blocks is for detachably holding a plurality of bobbin cases B circumferentially about the operating shaft . A plurality of rather than just one holding blocks may be mounted in parallel along the axis of the operating shaft . In the illustrated example there are provided two such holding blocks each holding six bobbin cases B so that a total of 12 twelve bobbin cases B can be held by each of the bobbin stock sections . In this case too any one of the bobbin cases B which has a lower thread of a desired color contained therein can be positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position or an empty holding position with no bobbin case B can be positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position by rotationally and linearly driving the operating shaft .

The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned construction where the single common operating shaft or in or is provided for all of the bobbin stock sections or corresponding to the rotary hooks for example the common operating shaft or may be provided for each predetermined group of the bobbin stock sections or for each of the bobbin stock sections.

The above described embodiments are constructed in such a manner that the orientation of the chuck device of the bobbin grasping device can be changed by one orientation changing mechanism in a predetermined position i.e. section where the engaging pins and or the engaging pin is provided of the transfer stroke of the bobbin grasping device both in the direction toward the rotary hook and in the direction toward the bobbin stock section or or . Alternatively an orientation changing motor of a small size may be mounted on the bobbin grasping device as shown in without the orientation changing mechanism being provided in a predetermined position of the transfer stroke of the bobbin grasping device so that the orientation of the chuck device can be changed via the orientation changing motor .

Namely in the illustrated example of the orientation changing motor indicated by a dotted line in the figure is mounted on a side of the moving member of the bobbin grasping device opposite from the side of the moving member where the chuck device is mounted and the chuck device is connected via the support arm to a rotation shaft of the orientation changing motor . Such arrangements allow the chuck device to be rotated as the motor rotates. Thus if the rotation shaft of the orientation changing motor is rotated through 180 degrees in one direction from the state where the chuck device is orientated in the first direction F for example the orientation of the chuck device can be changed so that the device is oriented in the second direction R. Conversely if the rotation shaft of the orientation changing motor is rotated through 180 degrees in the other or opposite direction the orientation of the chuck device can be changed so that the device is oriented in the first direction F.

The orientation change of the chuck device may be controlled by controlling the rotational angle of the motor . Whereas it is preferable that a motor suited for positioning control such as a pulse motor be used as the orientation changing motor any other suitable type of motor may be used as the orientation changing motor . Further the present invention is not limited to the above described construction where the support arm of the chuck device is connected directly to the rotation shaft of the orientation changing motor and the support arm of the chuck device may be connected to the rotation shaft via a speed changing or transmission mechanism such as a gear. Note that the orientation changing operation based on rotational driving by the motor may be performed at any suitable position during the transfer of the bobbin grasping device . For example the orientation change may be implemented by quickly rotating the orientation changing motor or by slowly rotating the orientation changing motor over a considerable part or whole of the transfer stroke. Further instead of the orientation of the chuck device being changed during the transfer of the bobbin grasping device the orientation of the chuck device may be implemented by temporarily stopping halting the transfer of the bobbin grasping device and rotating the orientation changing motor during the temporary stoppage of the bobbin grasping device .

In each of the holding portions H there are provided a thread hook member for hooking thereon a lower thread paid out from the bobbin case B set therein and a thread holding member having a thread holding portion for holding a distal end portion of the lower thread T. The thread holding portion comprises a dual structure formed by bending a plate and holds the distal end portion of the lower thread T between opposed portions of the bent plate. The distal end of the bent plate is formed as a cutting portion capable of cutting the thread. When a bobbin case B is set on the holding portion H a portion of the lower thread T paid out from the bobbin case B is hooked on the thread hook member and then held by the thread holding portion and then an excessive distal end part of the paid out lower thread portion is cut off by the cutting portion . Because the distal end portion of the lower thread T is reliably held or sandwiched by the thread holding portion it can be prevented from disengaging from the thread holding portion as the bobbin holder unit is rotated. Further the thread holding member has a mounting portion in the form of an elongated hole and the vertical position of the thread holding member can be adjusted as indicated by an imaginary line in by loosening a mounting screw . By adjusting the vertical position of the thread holding member the portion of the lower thread T paid out from the bobbin case B can be adjusted in length the portion of the lower thread T paid out from the bobbin case B when the bobbin case B has been set in the rotary hook can be made to have an appropriate length.

Driving motor for rotating the bobbin holder unit is fixed to the first base member of the bobbin stock section . Positioning cam is connected to the shaft of the driving motor and a boss portion of the positioning cam has an engaging recessed portion in which a left engaging portion of the bobbin holder unit is engaged. The positioning cam is a moving member moved by the driving motor and the bobbin holder unit is detachably attached to the moving member positioning cam as will be detailed below. is a sectional view taken along the I I line of . As clearly seen from the figure the left engaging portion of the bobbin holder unit has a straight upper surface in which is formed a recessed portion and a distal end portion of a ball plunger fixed to the boss portion is engaged in the recessed portion . Actuating pin having its distal end inserted in the engaging recessed portion is slidably provided on the boss portion . Coil spring is mounted on the actuating pin by which a flange shaped stopper is normally biased to abut against the bottom surface of the engaging recessed portion . Distal end portion of the actuating pin projecting beyond the stopper is fitted in an engaging hole formed in the left engaging portion . Pushing portion formed at the distal end of an upwardly extending lever portion of an actuating lever is located rearwardly of the actuating pin . The actuating lever is fixedly mounted on a shaft that is in turn supported at opposite ends to the first base member and second base member and an operating portion is formed at the distal end of a forwardly extending lever portion of the actuating lever . Torsion spring for normally biasing the actuating lever in a clockwise direction of is provided on the shaft so that the actuating lever is normally held at a pivotal position where its operating portion abuts against a restricting member fixed to the first base member .

Lock mechanism for locking a rotational position of the positioning cam is provided on the first base member . Constructions of these lock mechanism and positioning cam are similar to the construction related to the positioning cam described above in relation to and thus will not be described below to avoid unnecessary duplication.

Next a description will be given about how the bobbin holder unit is attached to the bobbin stock section constructed in the manner as shown in .

First a bobbin case B is set onto each of the holding portions H of the bobbin holder unit and an end portion of the lower thread T is held by the thread holding portion of the thread holding member . Then the bobbin holder unit is placed in a position posture where the straightly formed surface of the left engaging portion becomes the upper surface of the left engaging portion as shown in the right engaging portion of the bobbin holder unit is inserted between the guide member and holding member of the stock section and the left engaging portion of the bobbin holder unit is pushed into the engaging recessed portion . Openings of the portions and have slanted surfaces such that the two engaging portions and can be smoothly inserted therein see . As the right engaging portion enters between the guide member and the holding member the holding member pivots upward against the biasing force of the wire spring . Once the right engaging portion reaches the engaging recessed portion of the holding member the holding member pivots downward by the biasing force of the wire spring so that the right engaging portion is engaged and held in the engaging recessed portion as indicated by a solid line in .

On the other hand the left engaging portion deeply enters the engaging recessed portion and a distal end portion of the actuating pin is fitted into the engaging hole . Once the actuating pin reaches a position as indicated by a solid line in the distal end portion of the ball plunger is engaged and held reliably in the recessed portion against displacement.

In the aforementioned manner the bobbin holder unit can be set on the bobbin stock section . Note that the bobbin holder unit is limited in its left right horizontal position by the positioning stopper . As the driving motor is activated in this state with the locking by the lock mechanism of the positioning cam canceled the bobbin holder unit with the left engaging portion engaged in the engaging recessed portion rotates together with the positioning cam so that a desired one of the holding portions H in the bobbin holder unit can be positioned at the predetermined bobbin changing position.

Next a description will be given about how the bobbin holder unit is detached from the bobbin stock section in .

First the positioning cam is rotated so that the actuating pin is retracted as shown in . At that time the positioning cam may be rotated through activation of the driving motor or the human operator may manually cancel the locking by the lock mechanism as indicated by an imaginary line in to manually rotate the positioning cam . Then the operating portion of the actuating lever is depressed to cause the actuating lever to pivot as indicated by an imaginary line in . In this manner the actuating pin slides by being pushed by the pushing portion of the actuating lever so that the engagement between the distal end of the ball plunger and the recessed portion is canceled and thus the left engaging portion of the bobbin holder unit is pushed out. As the actuating lever pivots the driven lever too pivots as indicated by an imaginary line in via the shaft . Thus the holding member pivots upward by being pushed by the actuating portion of the driven lever so that the engagement between the engaging recessed portion of the holding member and the right engaging portion of the bobbin holder unit is canceled and the right engaging portion is pushed out. Namely as the actuating lever pivots the engagement by the engaging portions and of the bobbin holder unit is canceled and the engaging portions and are pushed out forward. In this way the bobbin holder unit can be detached from the bobbin stock section .

Because the bobbin holder unit having a plurality of bobbin holding portions H is detachably attached to the bobbin stock section a plurality of bobbin cases B can be set collectively on the bobbin stock section in a short period of time.

Further in the instant embodiment as shown in a mode selection switch operation switch first LED Light Emitting Diode and second LED are provided on the second base member . The mode selection switch is operable to select an ALL mode in which bobbin changes are implemented collectively in all of the machine heads an INDIVIDUAL mode in where a bobbin change is implemented only in the instant bobbin changer apparatus or a REST mode in which the instant bobbin changer apparatus is brought to a resting or non operating condition. The operation switch is operable to instruct a bobbin change and the bobbin change is implemented in accordance with the mode selected by the mode selection switch . Namely when the ALL mode is selected by the mode selection switch bobbin changes are implemented in all of the bobbin changer apparatus in response to ON operation of the operation switch . When the INDIVIDUAL mode is selected by the mode selection switch a bobbin change is implemented only in the instant bobbin changer apparatus. Further when the REST mode is selected by the mode selection switch no bobbin change is implemented in any one of the bobbin changer apparatus. To perform specific control for such purposes output signals of the mode selection switch and operation switch are input to the control device not shown comprising for example a computer and a predetermined bobbin changing program is executed in accordance with operating states of the mode selection switch and operation switch . Note that the mode selection switch and operation switch may be of self resetting switches or of any other suitable type which switches between a plurality of operating positions.

The above mentioned first LED is illuminated in green color while the bobbin changer apparatus is in an operable condition with the sewing machine powered on. The above mentioned second LED is illuminated in red color while the REST mode is selected and it is blinked when some error has occurred in the bobbin changer apparatus in question. By providing the above mentioned switches and display elements such as LEDs for each of the bobbin changer apparatus the human operator can check conditions of the bobbin changer apparatus and then and there it can cause the bobbin changer apparatus to implement a bobbin change. The display elements employed in the instant embodiment are not limited to LEDs and may be other suitable display means such as lamps.

Further in the instant embodiment there is provided a notification means such as an alarm sound generation device for notifying the human operator that the bobbin stock section has become empty by all of bobbin cases B loaded with respective lower threads set on the bobbin holder unit having been exchanged for empty bobbin cases or that the bobbin stock section has become almost empty by most of the bobbin cases set on the bobbin holder unit having been exchanged for empty bobbin cases. Such an alarm means is provided for each of the bobbin stock sections . The notification means prompts the human operator to set new replacement bobbin cases B loaded with lower threads into the bobbin holder unit in response to which the human operator detaches the bobbin holder unit holding the empty bobbin cases B from the bobbin stock sections and sets new bobbin cases B loaded with lower threads into the bobbin holder unit . If all of the bobbin cases B have been exchanged become empty in only a particular one or ones of the bobbin changer apparatus provided in the sewing machine a display for distinguishing the particular bobbin changer apparatus from the other bobbin changer apparatus may be made for example by blinking both of the first and second LEDs and of the particular bobbin changer apparatus. In this way the human operator can identify at a glance in which of the bobbin changer apparatus new bobbin cases B loaded with lower threads should be set onto the bobbin stock section.

When transferred to grasp a bobbin case B this chuck device can move closer to the bobbin case B than the first embodiment of the chuck device . Such movement of the chuck device will be described in detail in relation to a case where the chuck device is transferred to receive the bobbin case B mounted in the rotary hook . is a side view showing a state where an engaging portion of the holding member has abutted against the front surface of the bobbin case B by the chuck device being moved toward the rotary hook . Whereas the movement of the first embodiment of the chuck device is stopped at the time point when the engaging portion of the holding member has abutted against the front surface of the bobbin case B the second embodiment of the chuck device is moved further toward the rotary hook after the engaging portion of the holding member has abutted against the front surface of the bobbin case B. Namely the holding member does not move due to the abutting engagement with the bobbin case B and only the support arm in the second embodiment of the chuck device moves toward the rotary hook as indicated by an imaginary line. In this manner the coil spring is compressed so that the holding member is strongly pressed against the bobbin case B and thus the bobbin case B can be grasped reliably. Namely by the holding member being pressed against the bobbin case B with the biasing force of the coil spring the chuck device can reliably grasp the bobbin case B to be received from the rotary hook . Namely the bobbin case B to be received can be reliably grasped by the biasing force of the coil spring pressing the holding member against the bobbin case B.

When a bobbin case B is to be passed from the chuck device to the rotary hook on the other hand the chuck device behaves as follows. Namely after the grasping of the bobbin case B is canceled by disengaging the claw and even if the support arm moves away from the rotary hook or from the bobbin holder unit of the bobbin stock section the holding member keeps pressing the bobbin case B for some time i.e. over a predetermined range the holding member of the chuck device slides relative to the support arm with the result that the bobbin case B can be reliably passed to the rotary hook or bobbin holder unit .

In each of the bobbin changer apparatus a sensor not shown for detecting when the chuck device has moved to arrive at a particular target position slightly before a predetermined stop position close to the rotary hook or bobbin stock position. Once the arrival at the particular target position of the chuck device the movement of the chuck device is temporarily stopped halted and the driving motor is deactivated and the control waits until the chuck devices of all of the other bobbin changer apparatus which are currently implementing bobbin changes arrive at the same position. Once the chuck devices of all of the bobbin changer apparatus arrive at the same position the driving motor is activated to move the chuck device to the predetermined stop position. Namely by performing such control for synchronizing the chuck devices of all of the bobbin changer apparatus it is possible to prevent the motor of a particular chuck device having arrived at the target position earlier than the other chuck devices from stepping out in a case where there are differences in movement among the chuck devices of the bobbin changer apparatus.

The above described first embodiment of the chuck device too may press the holding member against the bobbin case B by further activating the transferring motor and causing the motor to step out after the engagement portion of the holding member has abutted against the front surface of the bobbin case B. However causing the motor to step out would produce undesired step out sound in the case where the sewing machine is equipped with a multiplicity of bobbin changer apparatus the step out sound would become extremely great sound noise. By contrast the second embodiment of the chuck device will never present such a sound noise problem.

The multi head embroidery sewing machine may sometimes be caused to operate with some of the plurality of machine heads placed in the operating condition and the other machine heads placed in the resting or non operating condition. In such a case bobbin changes are implemented only in the bobbin changer apparatus corresponding to the machine heads placed in the operating condition. Whether the bobbin changer apparatus should be placed in the operating condition or in the resting condition may be set either automatically in accordance with the operating resting settings of the machine heads or by the human operator. In the case where operating resting settings of the bobbin changer apparatus are made by the human operator arrangements may be made to facilitate the operating resting setting operation for example two machine head groups may be formed of every second machine head and the remaining machine heads e.g. group of odd numbered machine heads and group of even numbered machine heads so that bobbin changes are implemented in either one of the groups.

Namely according to each of the above described embodiments the chuck device or can be selectively caused to face toward the rotary hook or bobbin stock section or or by being caused to pivot through a predetermined angle via the motor mounted on the bobbin grasping device. Thus it is possible to provide a simplified orientation changing construction with an even further reduced number of component parts. Further even if the distance i.e. transfer distance between the rotary hook and the bobbin stock section differs depending on the type of the sewing machine used only the length of the guide bars have to be changed so that it is possible to readily deal with such a change in the specifications.

Further whereas the embodiments have been described as constructed in such a manner that each empty bobbin case B taken out from the rotary hook is temporarily stored into the bobbin stock section or or the present invention is not so limited and each empty bobbin case B may be recovered partway through the transfer stroke without being transferred to the bobbin stock section or . For example a bobbin reception section such as a gutter or belt conveyor may be provided under the transfer path of the transfer section in which case the empty bobbin case B is released from the chuck device and dropped to the bobbin reception section during the transfer of the chuck device with the empty bobbin case B grasped thereby. Such release of the bobbin case B may be performed while the transfer of the bobbin grasping device is in a temporarily stopped halted state or while the bobbin grasping device with the empty bobbin case B grasped thereby is being transferred. Empty bobbin cases B dropped to the bobbin reception section are preferably collected for example to one place. In this way it is possible to save the human operator the trouble of recovering the empty bobbin cases B from the bobbin stock section or .
