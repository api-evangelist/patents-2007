The invention described herein may be manufactured used sold imported and or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.

The present invention generally relates to lasers and more particularly to unstable monoblock laser cavities with integrated beam expanders.

Laser rangefinders are becoming an increasingly vital component in high precision targeting engagements. The precise and accurate range to target information is an essential variable to the fire control equation of all future soldier weapons. This information is provided easily and in a timely manner by laser range finders.

Current fielded laser range finders are bulky heavy and expensive. These laser range finders were not developed with the individual soldier and his special needs in mind.

The monoblock laser cavity a laser subassembly which lacks only an optical pump described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 373 865 whose disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference makes the development and fabrication of a very low cost compact laser range finder feasible. The monoblock laser cavity incorporates all of the optical components required for a short pulse laser on a thin substrate of the same or thermally equivalent material. These optical components are locked into alignment forming an optical laser cavity for flash lamp or diode laser pumping. The optical laser cavity never needs optical alignment after it is fabricated. The beam divergence of the monoblock laser is rather large 8 mrad low brightness laser which means a sizable optical system is required to collimate the monoblock laser output.

Referring to the drawings shows a conventional monoblock laser cavity . The monoblock laser cavity is made up of a plurality of discrete optical elements which are disposed serially on a substrate and which share a common optical axis . The typical cross section is square or rectangular even though it can take various other forms. The optical components are bonded into one block hence the name monoblock. The optical elements include a laser rod of gain material a passive Q switch an optical parametric oscillator OPO and an output coupler .

The laser rod has a uniform slit sliced through it at the Brewster angle to the optical axis thus producing two polarizing rod elements and from the single rod of gain material. The high reflector HR at the laser emission wavelength e.g. 1064 nm is coated on the input end face of the laser rod .

A high reflector HR at a laser emission wavelength e.g. 1064 nm and a partial reflector PR at an OPO wavelength e.g. 1570 nm are coated on the output end face of the output coupler . The HR coatings and act as the two mirrors defining an optical resonator.

The monoblock laser cavity shown in is a flat flat or stable resonator design. This design is acutely sensitive to any angular deviations of the mirrors from the optical axis. It also allows high order modes of lasing to occur which leads to poor beam quality. Note that the conventional monoblock laser cavity is lengthened in an attempt to improve beam quality. The beam divergence from a flat flat cavity is very weakly affected by cavity length.

This and other objects of the invention are achieved in one aspect by a monoblock laser cavity comprising a plurality of discrete optical components disposed serially on a substrate and sharing a common optical axis. The optical components include a laser rod of gain material a Q switch an OPO crystal an output coupler and a positive lens. The output coupler has a convex input end face and a concave output end face and acts as the expanding lens element of a beam expander and the positive lens completes the beam expander.

Another aspect of the invention involves a method of making a monoblock laser cavity comprising the steps of disposing a plurality of discrete optical components serially on a substrate so as to share a common optical axis the optical components including a laser rod of gain material a Q switch an OPO crystal an output coupler and a positive lens and designing the output coupler so that the output coupler has a convex input end face and a concave output end face and acts as the expanding lens element of a beam expander with the positive lens completing the beam expander.

The beam expander reduces the beam divergence of the monoblock laser. This permits use of a smaller diameter optical system to collimate the laser output for use in a laser range finder.

The monoblock laser cavity is smaller and more compact than the current monoblock laser cavity. It requires a smaller external telescope or if the same external telescope is used than it has a much tighter beam divergence.

The monoblock laser cavity is still a simple module that requires none of the labor extensive alignment procedures as current laser range finder solid state sources. It is much more insensitive to angular deviations than the original flat flat design which simplifies the manufacturing process. No optical holders have to be fabricated no complex engineering is required to design the optical cavity and no precise laser cavity alignments are required. Production labor and material costs are greatly reduced.

The monoblock laser cavity is a modular component. The modularity lends to ease of design for different pump sources. It can be incorporated in a flash lamp pumped or laser diode pumped system.

The monoblock laser cavity can be used as the laser source in very compact laser range finders. It generates eye safe laser output for eye safe laser range finding. These laser range finders have both military and commercial applications. The compact design of the monoblock laser cavity also lends itself to placement in other laser based portable and hand held devices. These include medical devices industrial tools or scientific equipment that can benefit from the size and weight reduction dependable performance and low cost.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the invention provides the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative embodiments of the invention. These embodiments are indicative however of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed. Other objects advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

In the detailed description that follows identical components have been given the same reference numerals.

Referring now to the drawings shows a monoblock laser cavity in accordance with the invention. Similar to the monoblock laser cavity the monoblock laser cavity is made up of a plurality of discrete optical elements which are disposed serially on the substrate and share a common optical axis . The typical cross section is square or rectangular even though it can take various other forms. The optical components are bonded into a monoblock. The monoblock laser cavity includes the following optical elements of the monoblock laser cavity described above the laser rod of gain material the passive Q switch and the OPO . However a different output coupler described below in further detail is used.

The laser rod has a uniform slit sliced through it at the Brewster angle to the optical axis thus producing two polarizing rod elements and from the single rod of gain material. The high reflector HR at the laser emission wavelength e.g. 1064 nm is coated on the input end face of the laser rod .

Preferably the material of the substrate is YAG YLF YVO etc. to achieve a thermal expansion match with the material of the laser rod also Nd YAG Nd YLF Nd YVO etc. as well as other active ions such as Erbium Er and the material of the Q switch is Cr4 YAG or other suitable materials for the alternative gain crystals. The laser emission wavelength may be 1064 nm for Nd YAG and other wavelengths for other materials and the OPO wavelength may be an eye safe 1500 1570 nm or any other wavelength that can be achieved through nonlinear crystal operation.

The output coupler includes a convex input end face and a concave output end face and a positive lens . The output coupler acts as the expanding lens element of a beam expander and the positive lens completes the beam expander. A shelf on the base is sized to assure the laser axis coincides with the center of the lens . A high reflector HR at a laser emission wavelength e.g. 1064 nm and a partial reflector PR at an OPO wavelength e.g. 1570 nm arc coated on the convex input end face of the output coupler . Anti reflectors AR and respectively at the OPO emission wavelength e.g. 1570 nm are coated on the concave output end face of the output coupler and on both end faces and of the positive lens .

The monoblock laser cavity is now a flat convex or unstable cavity. It is less sensitive than the flat flat cavity to angular deviations of the mirrors with respect to the optical axis. This design also mitigates the number of modes allowed to propagate within the laser cavity the higher order mode are subjected to more loss so that the output leaving the laser cavity consists of the lower order modes resulting in better beam quality. The output coupler and the positive lens can be fabricated out of YAG YLF YVO etc. to match the expansion coefficient of the other items in the monoblock laser.

The overall output energy of the unstable laser cavity is slightly less than that of the stable flat flat laser cavity how much depends on the size of the curvature selected for the convex side of the output coupler . But the achievable far field beam divergence is much much less.
