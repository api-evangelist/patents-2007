title: Splice variants of human G-protein coupled receptor HGPRBMY29 (HGPRMBY29SV2)
abstract: The present invention provides novel polynucleotides encoding HGPRBMY28 and HGPRBMY29 polypeptides, fragments and homologues thereof. The present invention also provides polynucleotides encoding splice variants of HGPRBMY29 polypeptides, HGPRBMY29v1 and HGPRBMY29v2. Also provided are vectors, host cells, antibodies, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing said polypeptides. Also provided are vectors, host cells, antibodies, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing said polypeptides. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods for applying these novel HGPRBMY28, HGPRBMY29, HGPRBMY29v1, and HGPRBMY29v2 polypeptides to the diagnosis, treatment, and/or prevention of various diseases and/or disorders related to these polypeptides. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention.
