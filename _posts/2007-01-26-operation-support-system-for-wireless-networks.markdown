title: Operation support system for wireless networks
abstract: Briefly, in accordance with one or more embodiments, an accounting management architecture for an operational support system for a wireless network comprises an accounting client capable of retrieving the accounting information from a base station and forwarding the accounting information to an accounting server of a connectivity service network (CSN) which may be the home CSN of the mobile station or a visited connectivity service network when the mobile station is roaming. If the mobile station is roaming, the visited CSN may function as a proxy/server between the visited accounting client and the home accounting server. An element management system may retrieve the accounting records and forward the accounting records to a billing processing system.

Accounting sessions are associated with a QoS profile Table as shown in Table 2.

The accounting records referred to in the headers of Table 1 are as follows Acc Session Index Index to the accounting record table MAC Address Uniquely identify a MS Service flow ID Uniquely identify a service flow for user traffic. If the service flow ID field is empty it means this record is for the control channels for example basic primary and secondary CIDs QoS Index Point to an entry in the QoS Profile Table that describe the QoS profile for such service flow Start Time Time stamp indicating the beginning of an accounting session Stop Time Time stamp indicating the ending of an accounting session Data Usage in Octects Indicates the data usage in octects that exclude any dropped packets Data Usage in MSDU Indicates the data usage in MSDU.
