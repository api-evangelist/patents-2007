title: Insensitive munitions barrier
abstract: A sympathetic detonation barrier for a munition includes a generally cylindrical polyethylene sleeve disposed over the munition. Preferably, the sleeve comprises HDPE. The sleeve may include vent openings in a side wall. In one embodiment, the sleeve extends from substantially a rear end of the munition to substantially a rear end of a fuze well of the munition.

This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60 807 833 filed on Jul. 20 2006 which application is hereby incorporated by reference.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to packaging for artillery ammunition that mitigates or eliminates sympathetic detonation.

Sympathetic detonation SD is the propagation of the detonation from one round of ammunition to adjacent rounds of ammunition when collocated in stowage or shipping configurations. SD yields substantial collateral damage including the loss of life and critical military equipment. The problem of propagation of the detonation reaction has existed since initial fielding of munitions containing high explosives. There had been no practical method to prevent SD in packaged high explosive ammunition until the development in the 1960s of anti fratricide stowage in ammunition compartments for combat vehicles specifically the M1 Abrams tank. A safe separation distance and reinforced bunkers barricades can prevent SD between high explosive ammunition but this technique is generally applied to stored munitions in ammunition magazines that are properly sited according to their hazard classification for safe storage distances.

Known methods of mitigating or eliminating SD address the problem in stowed configurations onboard combat vehicles but are not practical for the logistical life cycle of munitions. An important concern is the transport of large quantities of munitions to a theater of operations. SD during transport involves large quantities of munitions and can potentially have catastrophic consequences resulting in massive casualties damage to military and civilian equipment and damage to surrounding infrastructure. An historic example of this occurred in Kuwait during the first Gulf war in 1991. A malfunction in a vehicle s heater resulted in a high number of casualties with loss of life and military equipment ammunition vehicles etc as well as damage to the land and surrounding infrastructure. There is a need to eliminate the possibility of sympathetic detonation of ammunition during the logistical life cycle. The solution must be low weight space and cost effective. The technology must also enhance the packaging configuration and possess a level of portability. That is the device should be easily removed and reinstalled as required during shipping and handling operations prior to a fire mission.

It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method to mitigate SD of high explosive ammunition that is portable and provides protection during the complete logistical life cycle of the ammunition.

One aspect of the invention is a sympathetic detonation barrier for a munition comprising a generally cylindrical polyethylene sleeve disposed over the munition. Preferably the sleeve comprises HDPE. The sleeve may include vent openings in a side wall.

In one embodiment the sleeve extends from substantially a rear end of the munition to substantially a rear end of a fuze well of the munition. The sleeve may cover the rotating band of the munition.

In some embodiments the sleeve comprises a large inside diameter portion and a small inside diameter portion wherein the large inside diameter portion is adjacent the rotating band of the munition. The barrier may include means for securing a top portion of the sleeve to the munition.

Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a munition having a rear end a fuze well including a rear end and a rotating band and a sympathetic detonation barrier placed over the munition the sympathetic detonation barrier comprising a generally cylindrical polyethylene sleeve. The sleeve may comprise HDPE.

Yet another aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a pallet bottom having a plurality of recessed openings therein a plurality of munitions having rear ends placed in the recessed openings in the pallet bottom a plurality of generally cylindrical HDPE sleeves placed over the munitions and a pallet top having a plurality of openings therein wherein tops of the munitions are placed in the openings in the pallet top.

Still another aspect of the invention is a method of preventing sympathetic detonation of munitions comprising at least partially enclosing each munition in a generally cylindrical HDPE sleeve.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The invention mitigates or eliminates the problem of sympathetic detonation SD in large caliber high explosive packaged artillery ammunition. The invention may be applied to other types of ammunition as well such as missiles mines mortars grenades etc . The invention includes a generally cylindrical sleeve that is placed over high energy munitions. The sleeve is preferably made of high density polyethylene HDPE . The sleeve is of a thickness sufficient to prevent neighboring high energy munitions from SD. Thus a high order explosive event in one ammunition round will not propagate to neighboring ammunition rounds. The invention will also mitigate and or prevent the loss of life and subsequent collateral damage.

Sleeve may be provided with one or more vent holes formed in its side wall. The vent holes help mitigate corrosion of munition by allowing some air circulation. The HDPE sleeve is inexpensive light weight robust and provides for increased protection from environmental influences including physical abrasion and thermal loading from solar radiation. HDPE sleeve is highly resistant to chemical and biological elements and easily decontaminated. Used sleeves may be recycled. Sleeves produce minimal logistical impact when considered relative to the destructive results of mass detonation of stored unprotected munitions .

The length of the sleeve may vary from munition to munition. is a side view of a sleeve on a munition . Sleeve extends substantially from the top of the rotating band cover to the rear end of the fuze well of the munition . In this way sleeve surrounds the portion of munition containing the high explosive. Optionally sleeve may be secured to munition via a strap or other suitable means that passes through lifting lug and is attached on opposite sides of sleeve using for example screws rivets or other suitable means.

Examples of munitions that may use the sympathetic barrier of the invention are the 155 mm M107 and M795 high explosive HE artillery projectiles. The M107 HE projectile is about 684 mm long including the lifting plug and requires an SD barrier or sleeve that completely surrounds the explosive fill of the projectile. An SD barrier sleeve for the 155 mm M107 HE projectile is approximately 580 mm long and is about 9.53 mm thick. The M795 HE projectile is approximately 812.5 mm long including the lifting plug and requires a sleeve about 686 mm long and approximately 19.05 mm thick. In both examples the barrier sleeve should fill the space between the upper and lower plates of the projectile pallets. This space is the exposed portion of the HE filled projectiles.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
