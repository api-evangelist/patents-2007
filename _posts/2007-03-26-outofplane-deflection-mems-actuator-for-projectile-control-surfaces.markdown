title: Out-of-plane deflection MEMS actuator for projectile control surfaces
abstract: A MEMS type actuator includes a substrate defining a plane; a micro bellows disposed on the substrate and operable to expand in a direction out of a substrate plane, the substrate having an opening therein for fluid flow to the micro bellows; and a ramp disposed above the micro bellows. In a collapsed position of the micro bellows, the ramp is substantially parallel to the plane of the substrate and, in expanded positions of the micro bellows, the micro bellows applies a force to the ramp thereby causing rotation of the ramp in a direction out of the substrate plane.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties thereof.

The invention relates in general to microelectromechanical MEMS devices and in particular to MEMS devices that provide deflection out of the plane of the MEMS substrate.

Conventional systems for guiding missiles or projectiles in flight use canards or small wing like structures to steer the projectile. These structures are large approximately 3 in length and require motors to actuate. The stabilizing fins on the projectile have to be increased in size to counteract the effect the canards have of moving the center of pressure forward.

A MEMS control surface can reduce drag and hence increase the range of projectiles by eliminating the drag associated with canards and reducing the drag of the fins. In addition MEMS control surfaces may reduce volume weight and power requirements further increasing the projectile s range. Another added benefit of the MEMS control surface is the reduction of cost associated with batch fabrication techniques.

Known MEMS devices for producing a mechanical deflection include various types of thermally actuated beams including cantilever and arch beams. These beams have proven successful in producing a deflection in the plane of the MEMS substrate. Devices such as projectile control surfaces however require a deflection out of the plane of the MEMS substrate that is in a direction perpendicular to the MEMS substrate.

One MEMS type apparatus that provides out of plane deflection is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5 824 910 issued on Oct. 20 1998 and entitled Miniature Hydrostat Fabricated Using Multiple Microelectromechanical Processes. Another MEMS type apparatus that provides out of plane deflection is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 069 392 issued on May 30 2000 and entitled Microbellows Actuator. These two U.S. patents are expressly incorporated by reference. A third MEMS type apparatus that provides out of plane deflection is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 474 593 issued on Nov. 5 2002 and entitled Guided Bullet. 

The vertical deflection of a single diaphragm actuator like the hydrostat mentioned above is limited by the diameter of the diaphragm and its thickness. A micro bellows actuator is able to deliver much greater vertical deflections for a similar sized device. However the deflections required to make an effective control surface are many times greater than a micro bellows alone can provide. The electrostatically actuated curved beam shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 474 593 cannot withstand high speed flow forces. A suitable control surface can be realized by combining a micro bellows actuator with a ramp capable of being rotated out of plane.

It is an object of the invention to provide a MEMS device that can provide vertical deflection out of the plane of the MEMS substrate.

It is another object of the invention to provide a MEMS device that can provide vertical deflections larger than known MEMS devices.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a MEMS device that is operable as a control surface for high speed projectiles.

One aspect of the invention is a MEMS apparatus includes a substrate defining a plane a micro bellows disposed on the substrate and operable to expand in a direction out of the substrate plane the substrate having an opening therein for fluid flow to the micro bellows and a rotatable ramp disposed above the micro bellows where in a collapsed position of the micro bellows the ramp is substantially parallel to the plane of the substrate and where in expanded positions of the micro bellows the micro bellows applies a force to the ramp causing rotation of the ramp in the direction out of the substrate plane.

In an embodiment the MEMS apparatus further includes a ramp support disposed on the substrate the ramp being rotatably connected to the ramp support. The ramp may comprise a pair of legs and a body the pair of legs being connected to the ramp support and defining an open area therebetween wherein the micro bellows is disposed.

In another embodiment the ramp support includes a pair of spring supports disposed on the substrate and a pair of torsional springs the torsional springs being attached at first ends to the ramp and at second ends to the spring supports respectively.

In yet another embodiment the ramp support includes a hinge support disposed on the substrate and a hinge attached to the hinge support and the ramp.

In an alternative embodiment the micro bellows includes a plurality of bleed openings in a top surface thereof.

Another aspect of the invention is a projectile including a flow surface at least one MEMS apparatus disposed at the flow surface such that in a collapsed position of the micro bellows the MEMS apparatus is substantially flush with the flow surface and in an expanded position of the micro bellows the ramp of the MEMS apparatus extends out of a plane of the flow surface.

In an embodiment the projectile includes a plurality of the MEMS apparatus disposed at the flow surface. The projectile may further comprise a source of fluid pressure and a fluid connection between the source of fluid pressure and the opening in the substrate of the MEMS apparatus.

The ramp includes a pair of legs and a body . The pair of legs are connected to the pair of ramp supports with for example pins. The pair of legs define an open area therebetween where the micro bellows is disposed. is a bottom view of the device showing an opening in the substrate for fluid flow to the micro bellows .

In the collapsed position of the micro bellows the ramp is substantially parallel to the plane of the substrate . In expanded positions of the micro bellows the micro bellows applies a force to the ramp along a contact line thereby causing rotation of the ramp in the Z direction out of the substrate plane .

MEMS device may have a broad range of applications. In some applications such as safety and arming devices for munition fuzes it is often desired that a fluid flow be sustained for the munition to stay armed. In those cases the micro bellows shown in top view in may be substituted for micro bellows . Micro bellows is similar to micro bellows except that its top surface includes a plurality of bleed holes . Bleed holes allow fluid inside micro bellows to escape. Thus micro bellows will only maintain its expanded positions and ramp will only be extended in the Z direction if the fluid flow to the micro bellows is sustained. If the fluid flow ceases the fluid in micro bellows will escape thru bleed holes micro bellows will contract and ramp will rotate downward to the substrate .

As an example micro bellows may be used in a fuze for a projectile designed for in flight detonation. As long as the projectile is in flight the air pressure around the projectile can be used to maintain the micro bellows in an expanded position and the ramp extended in the Z direction to arm a fuze and allow detonation. If the projectile falls to the ground before detonation the micro bellows will contract from loss of air pressure and the ramp will rotate downward disarming the fuze.

The MEMS device may also be used to steer projectiles. shows a projectile . As used herein a projectile may be a missile rocket or any type of projectile with or without fins that is launched in air or water. shows a portion of a flow surface of a projectile . The flow surface may be the external surface of the projectile or it may be the surface of a fin wing rudder etc. A plurality of MEMS devices are disposed in an array on the flow surface . The MEMS devices may be arrayed in any manner and number required to steer the projectile . When the ramps of the devices are extended upward into the flow stream around surface the ramps will influence the flow stream and alter the path of the projectile .

A source of fluid pressure is connected via a fluid connection to the opening in the substrate . The source of fluid pressure may be for example the external air surrounding the flow surface or combustion products where the projectile is a rocket from an onboard combustion chamber connected to the opening via connection . Fluid flow to the micro bellows is controlled by for example a control valve disposed in the fluid connection and connected to an onboard guidance and control system . A relief valve may be disposed in the fluid connection to relieve pressure in micro bellows thereby allowing ramp to rotate down to a flush position.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
