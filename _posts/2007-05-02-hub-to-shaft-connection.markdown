title: Hub to shaft connection
abstract: A rotary shaft to hub connection, such as that used between a centrifugal compressor or pump and a shaft. The hub includes inner and outer axial extending members that fit within inner and outer annular grooves formed within the rotary shaft so that a tight fit between the shaft and the hub is maintained during high speed rotation. An inwardly extending projection is formed on the outer axial extending member of the hub that forms a tight fit against the shaft.

This Regular utility patent application claims the benefit to an earlier and Provisional patent application 60 797 772 filed on May 4 2006 and entitled CENTRIFUGAL IMPELLER TO SHAFT MOUNTS.

The present invention relates to impellers mounted to a rotary shaft and more specifically to a centrifugal impeller.

A centrifugal impeller mount on a rotary shaft of the prior art is shown in . In this prior art arrangement an interference fit is used to secure the impeller to the shaft by a tight fit. The shaft includes a smaller diameter portion and a larger diameter portion . The impeller includes a central hole having a larger diameter portion and a smaller diameter portion that forms a tight interference fit with the shafts the interference fits occurring at locations and on . As the impeller spins the fit loosens due to centrifugal forces. For heavily centrifugally loaded impellers the fit has to be very large. This usually causes assembly and disassembly problems. Also sometimes the impeller and shaft are of different materials and this too can cause problems with the fit. If the impeller has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than does the shaft at high temperatures the impeller will expand more than the shaft and therefore the fit will loosen even more. When the centrifugal force from rotation is added the fit will loosen even more. U.S. Pat. No. 6 481 970 B2 issued to Mukherjee et al on Nov. 19 2002 and entitled COMPRESSOR WHEEL WITH PRESTRESSED HUB AND INTERFERENCE FIT INSERT is one prior art reference that shows this design.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide for an impeller mounted to a rotatable shaft with a fit that will not loosen during rotation.

It is another object of the present invention to provide for an impeller that can be mounted to the rotatable shaft without pre stress such that the impeller can more easily be inserted onto the shaft.

The present invention is an inverted fit between the impeller and the shaft in order to use the centrifugal forces to promote a tight fit between the two. As the impeller spins faster the fit tightens instead of loosening as in the prior art fit. The inverted fit of the present invention is also good for impellers and shafts that have different materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion.

The present invention is shown in in which an impeller of a centrifugal pump or compressor is tightly fitted to a shaft . The shaft includes a larger diameter portion and a smaller diameter portion . An inner annular groove and an outer annular groove is formed in the shaft with axial extending portions and defined by the annular grooves and . this forms an inner axial extending portion and an outer axial extending portion on the shaft.

The impeller includes an inner axial extending member and an outer axial extending member that define an annular groove formed within the hub of the impeller. The axial extending members and of the impeller are sized and shaped to fit within the annular grooves and of the shaft. The fits are intended to be as tight as possible in order to provide a tight and secure fit between the impeller and the shaft and to be loose enough to allow the impeller to be fitted onto the shaft during assembly or disassembly. An inwardly facing projection of the impeller extends radially inward more than the section in order to allow for the impeller to more easily slide onto the shaft. The inwardly extending projection will form a tight fit against the shaft on which it abuts. The inward projection is shown to be formed on the hub instead of the shaft because this method would be easier to manufacture than would placing a projection on the shaft. However the projection could also be on the shaft instead of the hub.

As the impeller and shaft rotate together the impeller will grow in the radial direction due to centrifugal forces acting thereon. The two axial extending members of the impeller will still abut against the axial extending portions and of the shaft to maintain a tight fit between the impeller and the shaft. Also if the impeller is formed from a material that has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than does the shaft the inverted fit of the present invention will also maintain a tight fit under high temperatures.
