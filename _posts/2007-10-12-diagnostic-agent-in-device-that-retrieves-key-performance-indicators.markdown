Additional software firmware code components may also be present in the RAM and NVM . The term code may be used herein to represent one or more of executable instructions operand data configuration parameters and other information stored in memory of the electronic device and the term update package catalog may be used interchangeably with the term update package array to refer to received update information that comprises multiple update packages. The term application software or software application may be used herein to refer to code that provides functionality apparent to the user of the electronic device as opposed to that code in the electronic device that supports application software such as for example an operating system a file system software support for communications protocols and the like. Application software includes for example Internet web browsers calendars and or contact managers and software for engaging in a particular user or enterprise task to name just a few examples. The electronic device may also comprise interface circuitry not shown to enable operable connection of a subscriber identity module SIM card that may be employed in accordance with aspects of the present invention described in this document.

In one representative embodiment of the present invention an electronic device such as for example the electronic device of employs an update package not shown stored in RAM or NVM delivered by a remote server such as for example the download server to update firmware software data and configuration information in memory of the electronic device . Such an update package comprises update information including for example metadata describing an update checksums and instructions executable by one or more update agents such as for example the update agent of . The update agent processes a set of executable instructions which are used as a compact means to encode differences between existing first and updated second versions of firmware software data and configuration parameters for the electronic device . The executable instructions may be assembled into update packages to be transmitted to the electronic device for use in updating memory of the electronic device . One or more update agent s in the electronic device process respective portions of the executable instructions from an update package to convert transform corresponding portions of an existing first version of code in memory e.g. RAM and or NVM of the electronic device to portions of an updated second version of code. The electronic device may also receive provisioning information from for example the device management server the customer care server the diagnostic server and or a provisioning server to fix configuration problems or reconfigure software and hardware.

As shown in the electronic device may comprise a diagnostic client that facilitates remote diagnosis. The diagnostic client may have been installed at the time of manufacture of the electronic device or be downloaded at a later time using a wired or wireless link of the electronic device . The electronic device may also comprise a diagnostic agent that runs on the electronic device when required by conditions or on a continuing basis to perform monitoring and which manages and collects tracing information for transmission to a server such as for example diagnostic server using a cellular data network part of communication path . The electronic device of also comprises a traps client that facilitates the setting of traps and retrieving of collected information. The term trap may be used herein to refer to an action taken outside of operation of the electronic device for its intended use by executable code in the electronic device e.g. the traps client when one or more specified conditions are met. Traps can be used to collect data such as errors faults encountered while operating the mobile device network performance data and call setup data to name just a few examples. Such conditions may be remotely defined by for example messages sent by a server such as the diagnostic server or DM server for example. In one representative embodiment of the present invention the traps client and the diagnostic agent are combined into one embedded diagnostic client component capable of supporting traps as well as collecting diagnostic data and configuration information for eventual transfer to the diagnostic server or the customer care server .

The DM client of the electronic device may interact with the DM server the diagnostic client and the traps client to receive DM commands from the DM server and to implement them in the electronic device . The download server may be employed to download firmware and software updates e.g. update information in the form of for example update packages . The download server may also be used to download new firmware software such as for example the diagnostics client mentioned above which may then be installed and activated in the electronic device . The bootloader may be employed at power up or device reset to move executable code from for example the NVM into RAM for execution by processor .

As described briefly above an electronic device in accordance with a representative embodiment of the present invention e.g. electronic device receives update information e.g. an update package for processing by one or more update agents e.g. update agent to convert transform software e.g. application software and or firmware e.g. firmware to produce updated software firmware in the electronic device. In some representative embodiments of the present invention the update agent comprises multiple update agents each of the update agents appropriately arranged to process different types of update information for updating different types formats of software firmware user data and configuration parameters in the memory of the electronic device . Each of the update packages received is processed in the electronic device by an appropriate one of the update agent s to update an associated type of information in the memory of the electronic device .

In one representative embodiment of the present invention an Open Mobile Alliance OMA device management DM based applications server is composed of two parts an OMA DM based application and an OMA DM server such as for example the DM server shown in . An OMA DM based application is mainly focused on business processes logic and data. Such an application may reside on any of the servers shown in or on another server not shown that is in communication with a server of such as for example the DM server . An OMA DM server however is mainly focused on the functionality used to support the OMA DM protocol by which the OMA DM based application manipulates OMA DM capable electronic devices such as for example the electronic device of .

A customer care server such as for example the customer care server of may provide an application programming interface API for issuing OMA DM commands and values to OMA DM capable electronic devices including the ability to explore the device management tree DM tree on the electronic device. Bootstrapping the electronic device may be supported along with the ability to configure one or more bootstrap messages. A customer care server such as the customer care server may support a simple graphical user interface UI to allow OMA DM compatible electronic devices to be bootstrapped and for commands to be issued to allow the electronic device to be explored and configured via a browser such as for example an Internet browser.

In one representative embodiment of the present invention the code to support OMA DM based device management for customer care activities of a customer care server e.g. customer care server of is shared with an OMA DM based application server. Such a representative embodiment of the present invention helps a system operator to ensure that an application server and a customer care server produce identical behavior in their interactions with electronic devices under OMA DM based device management.

An OMA DM common framework in accordance with one representative embodiment of the present invention provides for the real time sharing of data by multiple OMA DM Based applications and may include sharing of the data from a DM tree in an electronic device such as the electronic device of . In a representative embodiment of the present invention each OMA DM based application may access the data used to create OMA DM commands for the electronic device .

Currently each manufacturer of an electronic device such as the electronic device of may place electronic device setting parameters e.g. GPRS setting in different locations within the DM tree of an electronic device they manufacture. This may cause the node uniform resource identifier URI of a given parameter to be different for each electronic device make model and version MMV . Some representative embodiments of the present invention provide a data store to be used in managing DM tree information. Such a data store may hold single device information such as the international mobile equipment identity IMEI of the electronic device a password and a nonce to name only a few examples. Some data may be customized for each OMA DM based application including for example the type of authentication scheme to be used and bootstrap content. Some representative embodiments of the present invention allow a user of a customer care system to modify the bootstrap content to specify the security type and profile type for devices. The security type may for example be one or both of Networkpin and Userpin . Some representative embodiments of the present invention permit notification and bootstrap functionality to be shared by OMA DM based customer care and application servers such as the customer care server and DM server of for example. Such an arrangement permits a user of the customer care server to specify for example a short message service center SMSC to be used for the sending of notification and bootstrap messages. Some representative embodiments of the present invention provide this functionality through a set of APIs and call back services that support the sending of DM commands and receipt of results.

A DM server such as for example the DM server in a representative embodiment of the present invention employs management objects MOs to enable electronic device management operation such as for example storing information retrieving information and activating or invoking functionality in the electronic device to name only a few operations. Managements objects and their nodes and sub nodes of representative embodiments of the present invention are extensions to those defined by a device management protocol such as for example the Open Mobile Alliance OMA device management DM V1.2 protocol developed under the direction of the Open Mobile Alliance Ltd. For example in a representative embodiment of the present invention a DM server e.g. the DM server sends one or more commands to a DM client e.g. the DM client of an electronic device e.g. the electronic device instructing the DM client in the electronic device to set identified management objects in a management tree stored in memory e.g. non volatile memory of the electronic device to a particular value. The management objects managed by the DM server and the DM client of the electronic device may for example direct the electronic device to store parameters in a particular parameter variable fetch the value of a particular parameter variable execute code in the electronic device to perform diagnostic functionality in the electronic device or to return results of previous diagnostic activity to a server.

As described briefly above the network of is able to conduct remote diagnostics on the electronic device . This is desirable when a user of the electronic device experiences operational issues that he she cannot resolve. Some operational anomalies may be resolve by analysis of settings in the electronic device which may be retrieved by the customer care server and or the diagnostic server for example. In some situations a customer care representative may employ a representative embodiment of the present invention to download and install executable code in the electronic device to actively monitor applications and diagnose problems.

In a representative embodiment of the present invention the electronic device may be used to request customer care service via a customer care server . During such activities device capability information may be provided to the customer care server or other server for example. A customer service representative CSR in communication with the customer care server provides service to the customer using the electronic device after reviewing analyzing the device capability information retrieved from the electronic device . This makes it unnecessary for a customer to provide such information himself to a CSR and avoids errors. In this manner the network of a representative embodiment of the present invention supports performance of remote diagnostics by a CSR using a server having the functionality of the customer care server of .

In a representative embodiment of the present invention the customer care server or DM server also supports diagnostic data collection requests from a diagnostic server such as the diagnostic server of and the return of collected diagnostics data to the diagnostics server . Diagnostics data collected by the electronic device may be sent in either push or pull mode by the electronic device to any authorized server in the network .

In a representative embodiment of the present invention a server such as for example the DM server or diagnostic server accesses one or more management objects MOs representing key performance indicators in a management tree such as the management tree to determine the performance or operating behavior of one or more layers of a communication protocol used in supporting an application on the electronic device . For example different layers of functionality of a communication protocol in an electronic device such as a network layer a service layer and an application layer may each have its own set of key performance indicator KPI values.

Although reference is made herein to network service and application layers this is by way of illustration or example and does not represent a specific limitation of an embodiment of the present invention. A representative embodiment of the present invention may be employed with a greater or lesser number of and or different protocol layers. For example aspects of the present invention may also be employed in an electronic device using the Open System Interconnect OSI model which defines seven protocol layers. In comparison to the OSI model the network layer in a representative embodiment of the present invention may correspond to for example the functionality of the physical data link and network layers of the OSI model. In a representative embodiment of the present invention the service layer may correspond to for example the functionality of the session and transport layers of the OSI model. In a representative embodiment of the present invention the application layer may correspond to for example the functionality of the presentation and application layers of the OSI model.

The term key performance indicator KPI is used herein to refer to any of a number of measurable parameters related to the operation of any of the layers of a communication protocol up to and including a user application. Examples of key performance indicators used at one or more of the network service and application layers described above include for example for both uplink and downlink paths available free memory and or memory buffers amount of processor real time available and or in use communication bit block frame and or packet error rates communication network delay and or latency a number and or frequency of occurrence of dropped connections burst data rates and measurements related to radio frequency communication quality such as band or radio frequency in use a signal to noise ratio and an Eb No. Indications of user preferences such as a user selection of channel user selected screen size frame rates bit rates color resolution to name only a few examples may also be employed as key performance indicators in representative embodiments of the present invention.

For example application software in an electronic device may support the consumption of streaming video content and may request that a service layer capability establish a communication link having a particular rate of data transfer between the electronic device and a server transmitting or receiving the content. At the application layer a software application may select a service layer protocol and request establishment of a communication path between the electronic device and a server. The service layer capability in the electronic device may elect to employ multiple concurrent communication links in order to support a requested data transfer rate. Using the capabilities of a network layer protocol the service layer may employ network layer capabilities of the electronic device to initiate establishment of the number of communication links needed to provide the requested rate of data transfer. The service layer may manage each of those multiple communication links establishing new links and or dropping existing links as necessary to maintain the requested rate of data transfer. An inability of the service layer to gain access to any of a number of resources such as for example sufficient usable memory in the electronic device and or a sufficient number of communication links to servers supporting the application may impact the data rate of an electronic device available to the application layer software firmware resulting in delivery to the user of less than the desired level of performance.

A user that experiences poor performance of an electronic device application that involves the exchange of digital content between the electronic device and one or more remote service providers has no means to determine the actual cause of the unsatisfactory user experience. Poor performance of one or more of the network service and or application layers involved in the delivery of the content may impact the overall experience of the user. In the prior art it is unlikely that the user of the electronic device the provider of wireless service or the operator of the of the servers engaged in exchanging content with the electronic device are able to determine the exact cause of poor performance and impact upon the user experience because they are unable to access the key performance indicators of the elements of the communication path between the content and the user during the communication activity.

In a representative embodiment of the present invention each of the exemplary protocol layers used to illustrate the issues at hand may be outfitted to permit remote retrieval of key performance indicators. In a representative embodiment of the present invention the retrieval of such key performance indicators is enabled through the user of management objects in a device management tree such as for example the management tree shown in .

A device management tree such as for example the device management tree of comprises a hierarchical tree structure stored in the memory of an electronic device such as the electronic device of . Each node or management object in the device management tree structure is accessible using an address such as for example a universal resource identifier that identifies the location of the management object in the device management tree. Each management object may consist of a single node or may comprise a collection of nodes that are related in some way. Each node has an associated value or contents. Such management objects may be created set and accessed remotely by a server such as for example the DM servers of and . In some representative embodiments of the present invention values of the nodes of management objects in a DM tree such as the DM tree of may be manually set by a user of the electronic device or may be values resulting from operation of various processes in the electronic device such as for example the functioning of the network service and application layers of a protocol used to support the exchange of digital information by the electronic device . In a representative embodiment of the present invention such management objects are extensions to the set of standardized management objects supported by a device management protocol such as for example the Open Mobile Alliance OMA device management DM version 1.2 protocol developed under the guidance of the Open Mobile Alliance Ltd. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention key performance indicators as described herein are values or data associated with one or more nodes in a device management tree such as the DM tree of .

It should be noted that although the use of key performance indicators in accordance with a representative embodiment of the present invention is explained herein in the context of a wireless mobile electronic device this is by way of illustration and does not represent a specific limitation of an embodiment of the present invention. Key performance indicators such as those described herein may be employed in wireless or wired electronic devices without departing from the scope of the present invention.

In the representative embodiment of the present invention shown in the UplinkKPI comprises a management object related to electronic device behavior or performance during communication in the uplink direction or from the electronic device to a remote server or service provider. In a similar manner the DownlinkKPI comprises a management object related to electronic device behavior or performance during communication in the downlink direction or from a remote server or service provider to the electronic device . A representative embodiment of the present invention may also have a node such as the ActiveAccounts node that comprises a management object that contains account information related to access to services subscribed to supported by the electronic device .

As describe above in one representative embodiment of the present invention the ServiceLevelKPI MO is added to a device management tree such as for example the DM tree in memory of the electronic device of when the associated service is installed or enabled on the electronic device . Installation of a new service in the electronic device includes associated program code for the service and for measurement of any related key performance indicators. Program code that enables access to the values contents of the key performance indicators for the new service is also installed in memory of the electronic device permitting a remote device management server such as the DM server of to access the elements of the ServiceLevelKPI MO when desired. The values contents of the ServiceLevelKPI MO retrieved by the remote server are determined and made accessible by program code associated with the newly installed service.

In the representative embodiment of the present invention shown in the content of node BufferSizes may comprise information identifying the size of buffers used by the application associated with the ApplicationLevelKPI MO . By retrieving such information a remote server such as for example the DM server or a customer care representative at a customer care server such as the customer care server of is able to determine whether a backlog of content is present at the application level in the electronic device . If node BufferSizes provides information for both uplink and downlink directions the DM server or the customer care server may determine whether the uplink path has insufficient capacity or has failed if the buffer size for the uplink direction swells or that the electronic device is unable to process content quickly enough if the downlink buffer size grows. If the content of the node MemoryUsage is determined to be higher than expected the DM server may determine that for example free usable memory is in short supply in the electronic device that a memory failure has occurred or that the application software associated with the ApplicationLevelKPI MO or another software application on the electronic device has consumed large amounts of free memory. In this latter case a customer care representative observing such a key performance indicator value may for example advise the user of the electronic device to stop operation of any unneeded application software running on the electronic device to help free memory for use by the application associated with the ApplicationLevelKPI MO .

Some representative embodiments of the present invention such as that shown in comprise a node FramesRates that contains information that identifies the number of frames transferred between the electronic device and a remote content server such as for example download server of . During the use of a streaming video application a user may experience performance issues and a remote server such as the DM server or diagnostic server may for example retrieve the FramesRates node and determine that distortions or jitter in displayed images is caused by a lower than acceptable frame rate or that the user is requesting a frame rate that is not supportable using the level of communication service supported by the user s current subscription. In addition a node such as ProblemEncountered may be used to determine the types of some of the problems that the software application on the electronic device is encountering including for example the loss dropping of frames and issues stemming from problems with the user s services account. A node such as the UserPreferences node shown in may also reveal that the user has set the associated application to operate with a screen size that is not supportable by the electronic device or by the communication bandwidth currently available.

In some representative embodiments of the present invention the NetworkLevelKPI MO contains information related to a particular bearer or communication service provider in the management tree of . In such an embodiment of the present invention the management tree comprises a NetworkLevelKPI MO for each communication traffic bearer available for use by the electronic device .

In some representative embodiments of the present invention each bearer specific NetworkLevelKPI MO comprises a collection of nodes such as those shown in . The content of the first of these illustrated nodes Network Bandwidth for Uplink Downlink comprises information identifying the amount of network bandwidth currently in use by the electronic device using the associated bearer. The context of the next node Latency enables a remote server to determine the delay or latency currently being experienced by content exchanged via the associated bearer. The CorruptPackets node may be retrieved to access a measure of the number of corrupted packets received by the electronic device when using the associated bearer. The DroppedConnection node shows a frequency count of connections that are unintentionally dropped or lost following establishment. The BurstRate node contains a measure of the data rate for burst rate traffic and the OtherQoSParameters node may contain other quality of service measures and parameters that may be verified when retrieved from the electronic device and compared with a network subscriber information database to verify correct settings in the electronic device .

In one representative embodiment of the present invention a diagnostic client such as for example the diagnostic client of is told to collect KPIs or to provide KPIs from any or all of the application service and network layers. In such an embodiment the diagnostic client may use a diagnostic function for each application level KPI for each network level KPI and for each service level KPI. Such a diagnostic function may return an extensible meta language XML data string or the KPI values. The KPI value may be defined and supported by the original equipment manufacturer OEM of the electronic device for example. In a representative embodiment of the present invention device specific KPIs may be received by a diagnostic server such as the diagnostic server of and parsed using an XML schema a data type definition DTD or XML structure information provided by the OEM of the electronic device for example. In some representative embodiments of the present invention the OEM may provide parsers used to parse the KPI data sent from the electronic device . Such parsers may be used by and or plugged into a diagnostic server or a customer care server such as the diagnostic server of or the customer care server of for example.

In a representative embodiment of the present invention a network level KPI may comprise bearer specific content and an electronic device such as the electronic device of for example may support multiple networks i.e. bearers at the same time. For example the electronic device may support a variety of networks such as a General Public Radio Service GPRS network an SPRS network a wireless local area network WLAN to name only a few examples. In one representative embodiment of the present invention each network supported by the electronic device has its own KPIs and management objects supporting access to such KPIs by a remote server such as the device management server and diagnostic server of or the customer care server of for example.

In a representative embodiment of the present invention each software application in an electronic device e.g. the application software in the electronic device may enable retrieval of its KPIs via a device management DM client such as the DM client of . For example one representative embodiment of the present invention may support registration of an application s KPI node i.e. a management object MO having the KPIs of the application as elements of the MO with a DM client such as the DM client of . Another representative embodiment of the present invention may employ an application manager to effect registration of an application with the DM client of or with a registry in the electronic device . Such registration may for example be performed as part of the installation of the application onto the electronic device during an update of software firmware of the electronic device . For example installation of a new software application e.g. application software of may comprise not only adding new program code to memory in the electronic device for the functionality of the application but may also comprise the addition creation of new management objects for the key performance indicators of the software application any program code and or data needed to permit the collection of the data of the key performance indicators for the software application and any program code and or data for making the key performance indicator values content accessible via the associated management object s . In a representative embodiment of the present invention the update information for updating the software firmware of the electronic device may include for example program code for suitable software firmware components such as drivers functions routines dynamic link libraries and application program interfaces to permit the application to provide or expose KPI values contents via the elements nodes of the management object of the application. In a similar fashion support for new services and networks may add new management objects program code and data that enables access to service level and network level KPIs for the added service s and network s .

In a representative embodiment of the present invention a diagnostic client such as for example the diagnostic client of makes it possible to enable retrieval of KPIs to disable retrieval of KPIs and to configure collection of KPIs to name a few capabilities. In some representative embodiments of the present invention control over remote and or local access to key performance indicators is provided through the use of addition nodes in a management tree such as for example the management tree of . For example an additional node not shown may be present as part of a management object such as for example the ApplicationLevelKPI MO of which permits access to the elements of the ApplicationLevelKPI MO to be granted only for those device management activities that are previously authenticated. For example an additional node not shown may be accessed by a remote server such as the DM server or diagnostic server to authenticate the server to the electronic device and thereby enable the remote server to access the BufferSizes node the MemoryUsage node the FramesRates node the ProblemEncountered node and the UserPreferences node . It should be clear upon a careful reading and understanding of this disclosure that some key performance indicators may represent information considered private by for example a provider of services by the manufacturer of an electronic device and or by a user of the electronic device and that a representative embodiment of the present invention enables the remote collection of such private and detailed operational information for the electronic device on a real time basis during the operation of the electronic device by a user.

For example in one representative embodiment of the present invention a user of an electronic device such as for example the electronic device may start a software application e.g. application software of present on the electronic device to exchange information content with a content server of a service provider. At some point in the use of the application the user may experience problems with the operation of the software application and call a customer care representative to complain. When contacted by the user the customer care representative uses a customer care server such as for example the customer care server to cause key performance indicators associated with the use of the software application to be retrieved from the electronic device . The retrieval of the KPIs may be performed immediately providing the last known values of the KPIs for the software application or the customer care representative may arrange for collection of the KPIs for the application from the electronic device during a later use of the software application. During a later use of the software application by the user the content server of the service provider or another server may retrieve one or more key performance indicators associated with use of the software application that is experiencing difficulties in real time during actual use of the software application on the electronic device . In this way a representative embodiment of the present invention permits remote access to key performance indicators of multiple levels of a communication protocol during use of the application and communication protocol in the electronic device. In a representative embodiment of the present invention a remote server such as the customer care server or the diagnostic server of analyzes the retrieved key performance indicators to determine the state of the various layers or levels of activity surrounding the operation of the software application. In this way a representative embodiment of the present invention provides a window into the operation of a communication protocol used by an electronic device in real time during the use of the software application under the conditions that cause unsatisfactory performance enabling correction of any software firmware configuration provisioning and service provider issues that may be a source of the performance complaint.

In a representative embodiment of the present invention device management functionality in the electronic device permits the monitoring of various levels of a communication protocol such as for example the application level the service level the network level and enables communication of key performance indicators of those protocol levels to a remote server. The device management functionality and the type and encoding of the various key performance indicators that may be employed may be established in an industry standard or may be proprietary to the manufacturer of an electronic device. The manufacturer of an electronic device may provide to the operator of the infrastructure with which the electronic device communicates applications software capable of parsing disassembling and or interpreting the meaning of the key performance indicators communicated from the electronic device to a remote server. The server may be operated by the manufacturer of the electronic device or such information may be communicated to the manufacturer from the server. In this manner a representative embodiment of the present invention enables a manufacturer to remotely monitor control and diagnose for example communication activities of an electronic device without the communication infrastructure having knowledge of the contents of the messaging used and proprietary performance information for the electronic devices.
