The invention is in the field of microcavity plasma devices also known as microdischarge devices or plasma devices.

Microcavity plasma devices produce a nonequilibrium low temperature plasma within and essentially confined to a cavity having a characteristic dimension d below approximately 500 m. This new class of plasma devices exhibits several properties that differ substantially from those of conventional macroscopic plasma sources. Because of their small physical dimensions microcavity plasmas normally operate at gas or vapor pressures considerably higher than those accessible to macroscopic devices. For example plasma devices with a cylindrical microcavity having a diameter of 200 300 m or less are capable of operation at rare gas as well as Nand other gases tested to date pressures up to and beyond one atmosphere. In contrast standard fluorescent lamps for example operate at pressures typically less than 1 of atmospheric pressure. High pressure operation of microcavity plasma devices is advantageous. It is well known for example that plasma chemistry at higher pressures favors the formation of several families of electronically excited molecules including the rare gas dimers Xe Kr Ar . . . and the rare gas halides such as XeCl ArF and KrF that are known to be efficient emitters of ultraviolet UV vacuum ultraviolet VUV and visible radiation. This characteristic in combination with the ability of microplasma devices to operate with a wide range of gases or vapors and combinations thereof offers emission wavelengths extending over a broad spectral range. Furthermore operation of the plasma in the vicinity of atmospheric pressure minimizes the pressure differential across the packaging material when a microplasma device or array is sealed.

Another unique feature of microplasma devices is the large power deposition into the plasma typically tens of kW cmor more which is partially responsible for the efficient production of atoms and molecules that are well known optical emitters. Consequently because of the properties of microplasma devices including the high pressure operation mentioned above and their electron and gas temperatures microplasmas are efficient sources of optical radiation.

Microcavity plasma devices have been developed over the past decade for a wide variety of applications. An exemplary application for an array of microplasmas is in the area of displays. Since single cylindrical microplasma devices for example with a characteristic dimension d as small as 10 m have been demonstrated devices or groups of devices offer a spatial resolution that is desirable for a pixel in a display. In addition the efficiency for generating with a microcavity plasma device the ultraviolet light at the heart of the plasma display panel PDP can exceed that of the discharge structure currently used in plasma televisions.

Early microplasma devices were driven by direct current DC voltages and exhibited short lifetimes for several reasons including sputtering damage to the metal electrodes. Improvements in device design and fabrication have extended lifetimes significantly but minimizing the cost of materials and the manufacture of large arrays continue to be key considerations. Also more recently developed microplasma devices excited by a time varying voltage are preferable when lifetime is of primary concern.

Research by the present inventors and colleagues at the University of Illinois has pioneered and advanced the state of microcavity plasma devices. This work has resulted in practical devices with one or more important features and structures. Most of these devices are able to operate continuously with power loadings of tens of kW cmto beyond 100 kW cm. One such device that has been realized is a multi segment linear array of microplasmas designed for pumping optical amplifiers and lasers. Also the ability to interface a gas or vapor phase plasma with the electron hole plasma in a semiconductor has been demonstrated. Fabrication processes developed largely by the semiconductor and microelectromechanical systems MEMs communities have been adopted for fabricating many of the microcavity plasma devices. Use of silicon integrated circuit fabrication methods has further reduced the size and cost of microcavity plasma devices and arrays. Because of the batch nature of micromachining not only are the performance characteristics of the devices improved but the cost of fabricating large arrays is also reduced. The ability to fabricate large arrays with precise tolerances and high density makes these devices attractive for display applications.

This research by the present inventors and colleagues at the University of Illinois has resulted in exemplary practical devices. For example semiconductor fabrication processes have been adopted to demonstrate densely packed arrays of microplasma devices exhibiting uniform emission characteristics. Arrays fabricated in silicon comprise as many as 250 000 microplasma devices in an active area of 25 cm each device in the array having an emitting aperture of typically 50 m 50 m. It has been demonstrated that such arrays can be used to excite phosphors in a manner analogous to plasma display panels but with values of the luminous efficacy that are not presently achievable with conventional plasma display panels. Another important device is a microcavity plasma photodetector that exhibits high sensitivity. Phase locking of microplasmas dispersed in an array has also been demonstrated.

The development of microcavity plasma devices continues with an emphasis on the display market and the biomedical applications market. Widespread adoption of microcavity plasma devices in displays will hinge on several critical factors including efficacy discussed earlier lifetime and addressability. Addressability in particular is vital in most display applications. For example for a group of microcavity discharges to act as a pixel each microplasma device must be individually addressable.

With this invention microcavity plasma devices and arrays of microcavity plasma devices are provided that have a reduced excitation voltage relative to previous devices and arrays. A trigger electrode disposed proximate to a microcavity reduces the excitation voltage required between first and second electrodes to ignite a plasma in the microcavity when gas es or vapor s or combinations thereof are contained within the microcavity. Also provided is a symmetrical microplasma device for which current waveforms are the same for each half cycle of the voltage driving waveform.

An embodiment of the invention is a microcavity plasma device having a microcavity formed in a substrate. First and second electrodes are disposed to excite a plasma in the microcavity upon application of a time varying potential AC RF bipolar or pulsed DC etc. between the first and second electrodes. The structure of the devices is that of a dielectric barrier configuration in which dielectric films isolate the first and second electrodes from a plasma formed in said microcavity. A trigger electrode disposed proximate to the microcavity reduces the required voltage potential between the first and second electrodes to ignite a plasma. In preferred devices a controller power supply applies a voltage waveform to the trigger electrode to reduce the required operating voltage applied to the first and second electrodes.

An embodiment of the invention is a microcavity plasma device having a trigger electrode that reduces the excitation voltage required to be supplied to the first and second electrodes of the device. In a preferred embodiment a substrate has a microcavity formed therein. First and second electrodes are disposed to excite a plasma in the microcavity upon application of a time varying potential AC RF bipolar or pulsed DC etc. between the first and second electrodes. One or more dielectric layers isolates the first and second electrodes from a plasma formed in said microcavity. A trigger electrode is disposed proximate to said microcavity.

Devices and methods of the invention provide low voltage addressable microcavity plasma device arrays. In a preferred embodiment transparent trigger electrodes are positioned opposite microcavities in an array of microcavity plasma devices. The trigger electrodes can be driven with a small time varying voltage to produce a substantial reduction in the voltage levels required to be supplied to driving electrodes of the microcavity plasma devices in the array. In an example embodiment the first electrodes are connected electrically to those of microcavities in a row within an array and the second electrodes are connected electrically to those of microcavities in a column within that array. Individual microcavities in the array are addressed and addressing can be accomplished with voltage waveforms applied to the trigger electrode.

Preferred embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic figures that are not to scale which will be fully understood by skilled artisans with reference to the accompanying description. Features may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration. From the preferred embodiments artisans will recognize additional features and broader aspects of the invention.

A microcavity is defined in a substrate . The microcavity can have any number of shapes. The shape cross sectional geometry and depth of the microcavity as well as the identity of the gas es or vapor s in the microcavity the applied voltage and the voltage waveform determine the plasma configuration within the cavity and the radiative efficiency of a plasma given a specific atomic or molecular emitter. Example microcavity shapes include cylinders and inverted pyramids. Preferred embodiment devices include microcavities that have tapered sidewalls. Tapered cavities are relatively inexpensive and easy to fabricate using conventional wet chemical processing techniques for semiconductors. The positive differential resistance of devices with tapered sidewalls permits self ballasting of the devices and simplifies external control circuitry. Microdischarge devices with tapered cavities also offer an increase in microcavity surface area and control over the depth of the microcavity to be fabricated thereby enabling straightforward modification of the electrical properties of devices as desired. In addition increased radiative output efficiencies are obtained by coating the tapered side walls with an optically reflective coating or a coating with a relatively small work function. Additional information regarding particular tapered cavities can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7 112 918 entitled Microdischarge Devices and Arrays Having Tapered Microcavities which issued Sep. 26 2006. The inverted pyramidal shape of the microcavity in represents a preferred embodiment and is shown in and other embodiments to be discussed below.

Substrate can be formed of any material amenable to semiconductor fabrication processes including semiconductor conductor or insulator materials. However the inverted pyramidal microcavity of is formed with precision and economically if substrate is silicon which is the material of choice in preferred embodiments. In the device of the substrate is conductive and forms a first electrode which is isolated from a second electrode by dielectric and dielectric also isolates the electrodes and from the cavity . Specifically a multi layer dielectric including first dielectric layers and second dielectric layers achieve the isolation. The dielectric layers and can be for example metal oxide SiO SiN or polymer layers. The first and second dielectric layers are preferably formed of different materials. Dielectric performance can be improved with multiple dielectric layers of different materials. In one preferred embodiment of the invention dielectric films and are SiOor SiNwhereas dielectric is a polymer e.g. polyimide.

Trigger electrode which serves to reduce the voltage required to ignite a plasma in microcavity is also electrically and physically isolated from the microcavity and the other two electrodes by a multilayer dielectric. The trigger electrode in device is disposed adjacent to microcavity and yet is isolated from the microcavity by the dielectric layer . A gas or gases vapor or vapors or combinations of gas es and vapor s is sealed in the microcavity by a transparent layer e.g. glass or plastic. Phosphor disposed within the microcavity is useful for example to produce color displays. Additionally the color of an emission from the microcavity is influenced by the type of gas es and vapor s in the microcavity. The device of is readily replicated to form an array of low voltage microcavity plasma devices.

An additional similar embodiment low voltage microcavity plasma device is shown in . In this embodiment the phosphor coating is thicker than that of . Standoff portions and provide separation between the layer and the dielectric and can either be trigger electrodes or a dielectric wall to prevent cross talk between pixels. These portions also create void areas around the microcavity which can be used as a gas gap to prevent cross talk or as a bonding area e.g. for glass device packaging.

Another embodiment microcavity plasma device of the invention is illustrated in cross section in . The primary difference between this structure and that of is the addition of another dielectric layer above the electrodes and within the microcavity . Experimental tests indicate that this design is effective in containing the plasma within the inverted pyramidal microcavity . Measurements also indicate no detrimental effects such as an increased firing voltage arising from the additional dielectric layer. In a preferred embodiment the layer is a polymer e.g. polyimide and is relatively thick 2 15 m . Alternating polymer and nitride dielectric layers have shown good performance in experimental embodiments. In a preferred embodiment layers are nitride layers and layers are polymer layers. In other embodiments the dielectric layers are formed of ceramic materials. One particular example embodiment has the layer formed of a low temperature melting glass layer and it can serve as both a dielectric layer and an adhesive to bond a layer such as layer not shown in .

Another preferred embodiment of the microplasma device is illustrated in cross section in . This device is double sided symmetrical with two connected cavities and therefore produces identical current waveforms in each half cycle of the driving voltage waveform. To fabricate this structure requires a thin substrate preferably silicon such that etching of the pyramidal microcavities will breach the Si wafer completely. That is a hole is formed that is centered on the apex of the two square pyramids. The opening produced by the wet etching process in silicon 100 wafers has a square cross section. The device of operates by using the Si substrate as an electrode common to both microcavity devices. The second electrode for each of the two devices is the conducting layer lying at the edge of the microcavity opening. Thus a source of time varying voltage can be connected to the device of in such a way that on each half cycle of the voltage waveform one of the two Si microcavities acts as the cathode. The cavity serving as the cathode switches each half cycle. The dielectric layers in are the same as those of and are labeled with similar reference numbers. Another advantage of the structure of is that a portion of the light produced by the microplasma in either cavity is coupled into the other cavity. Therefore by placing an optically reflective surface above or below the device of more light can be obtained than is available from either microcavity alone.

In all of the embodiments a discharge medium gas vapor or combination thereof is contained in the microcavities and microplasmas are produced within the microcavities when a time varying voltage waveform having the proper RMS value is supplied to electrodes and . The driving voltage may be sinusoidal bipolar DC or unipolar DC for example. Application of another voltage waveform to the trigger electrodes reduces the RMS value required to be supplied to the first and second electrodes .

Devices and arrays can be sealed by any suitable material which can be completely transparent to emission wavelengths produced by the microplasmas or can for example filter the output wavelengths of the microcavity plasma devices and arrays so as to transmit radiation only in specific spectral regions. The transparent layer illustrated in the various embodiments can be for example a thin glass quartz or plastic layer. The pressure of the discharge medium can be maintained at or near atmospheric pressure permitting the use of a very thin glass or plastic layer because of the small pressure differential across the transparent layer .

Example experimental devices have been fabricated to demonstrate the invention. Trigger electrodes substantially reduce the voltages required by driving electrodes e.g. address and sustain electrodes to ignite a plasma. Small voltage pulses applied to the trigger electrodes show a substantial benefit in a reduction of the driving voltage which is advantageous in many applications. Microcavity plasma devices of the invention can form the basis for small and large scale high resolution displays.

Experimental data and devices are presented here and illustrate exemplary embodiments. The experimental devices are readily produced in larger formats as will be appreciated by artisans. Many additional features aspects and embodiments of the invention will be apparent to artisans. Artisans will recognize additional features and variations as well as broader aspects of the invention from the data and description presented herein.

Example experimental device structures were fabricated on a Si wafer and included a bottom electrode which enters each pyramidal Si device and runs along the bottom of the pyramid. This is similar to the structure shown in . The device is powered by two electrodes the first of which is a 50 100 m wide Ni strip that passes through the microcavity and on to the next device. After depositing a multilayer dielectric on top of the first electrode a second Ni electrode is then patterned onto the device near the periphery of each microcavity .

In experiments electrodes were 100 200 m wide. Electrodes of this width are easier to align with the trigger electrode and transparent layer. Wide electrodes are also beneficial as the increased electrode area allows for larger currents significantly improved array brightness and a more symmetric plasma produced in each pixel. Also this structure is free of crosstalk. In the experimental devices the electrode width is a bit larger than that of the microcavity leading to the production of plasma outside the mouth of each microcavity. Although the pyramidal microcavity has an aperture of 100 100 m the aperture narrows to 70 m because of the dielectric and electrode films overcoating the cavity. Arrays with 70 m wide electrodes have also been fabricated to confine the plasma in the microcavity. Artisans will appreciate that commercial semiconductor fabrication techniques are well suited to readily align small width electrodes with microcavities and with associated trigger electrodes for all of the illustrated embodiments and for other low voltage arrays of microcavity plasma devices of the invention.

A particular experimental array of microcavity plasma devices was an array of 20 20 microcavity plasma devices. The microcavities in the experimental device had bottom electrodes that were 100 m in width and were operated at 600 Torr Ne. During operation the array showed high uniformity of emission within each microcavity but a slight grading of the intensity across an array of devices. This nonuniformity is attributed to the resistivity of the electrodes because the film thickness of the electrodes was only 0.15 m. Increased electrode thickness e.g. 0.35 m is expected to improve further the uniformity of emission across the array.

Experiments did demonstrate a substantial reduction in the voltage required to ignite a plasma in the microcavities. Specifically the ignition voltage for Ne 5 Xe mixtures 600 Torr is only 180 V for devices with 100 m wide bottom electrodes. Devices that are otherwise similar but lacking a trigger electrode required 200 V.

50 50 arrays of experimental devices having the three electrode device configuration of the embodiment shown in were tested in detail. illustrates the convention for the application of voltage waveforms during testing as would be applied by a controller to reduce the required voltage to ignite a plasma. shows the voltage waveforms applied by the controller during testing. The voltage waveforms applied to electrodes X and Y were chosen to be mirror images of one another as shown in . Each pulse positive or negative has a temporal width of 10 sec. Because of the proximity of electrodes Z and X an ITO film and Ni electrode respectively electrode Z serves as a trigger electrode and the lowest waveform in is that supplied to electrode Z for the tests to date. Table I presents the results of ignition tests with the 50 50 pixel array. With no voltage waveform applied to electrode Z array ignition requires both Vand Vto be 165 V. Surprisingly supplying only 40 V pulses to electrode Z reduces Vby 25 V and Vby 5 V. Further increases in the voltage delivered to the address electrode result in the required value of Vdropping by as much as 42 V. The minimum address electrode voltage measured in testing when using the trigger electrode is well below the 80 100 V typically required to address the plasma pixels in a conventional plasma display panel PDP . It was also found Table II that increasing the widths of the pulses supplied to the address electrode Z beyond 2 5 sec had little effect on array performance.

Use of the trigger electrode as an address electrode is so effective that it was possible to sustain the array with the waveforms illustrated in . Notice that in that a five cycle sequence of waveforms identical to those of is applied to electrodes X and Y but only one cycle is delivered to the address trigger electrode.

Additional variations to the embodiments discussed earlier include 1 decreasing the Z X electrode gap at 0.5 mm in example prototypes in order to reduce the address voltage further and 2 exploiting the pressure dependence of the switching behavior of these arrays. The rise and fall times of the plasma fluorescence and analyzing the effect on discharge properties of varying the drive waveforms are also of interest. Experiments have been carried out thus far with Ne gas and Ar Dmixtures to produce ultraviolet emission from the argon deuteride excimer ArD .

Another alternative driving waveform is a bipolar pulsed DC waveform in which each addressable channel overlaps with the other with opposite polarity. This results in lowering the driving voltage by a factor of two. shows an example of the pulsed voltage waveform in the sustain mode.

While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described it should be understood that other modifications substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which should be determined from the appended claims.
