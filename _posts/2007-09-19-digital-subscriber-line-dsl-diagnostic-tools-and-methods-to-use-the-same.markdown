This disclosure relates generally to digital subscriber line DSL services and or systems and more particularly to DSL diagnostic tools and methods to use the same.

Communication systems using digital subscriber line DSL technologies are commonly utilized to provide Internet related services to subscribers such as for example homes and or businesses also referred to herein as users customers and or customer premises . DSL technologies enable customers to utilize telephone lines e.g. ordinary twisted pair copper telephone lines used to provide Plain Old Telephone System POTS services to connect the customer to for example a high data rate broadband Internet network broadband service and or broadband content. For example a communication company and or service provider may utilize a plurality of modems e.g. a plurality of DSL modems implemented by a DSL Access Multiplexer DSLAM at a central office CO to provide DSL communication services to a plurality of modems located at respective customer premises. In general a CO DSL modem receives broadband service content from for example a backbone server and forms a digital downstream DSL signal to be transmitted to a customer premises DSL modem. Likewise the central office DSL modem receives an upstream DSL signal from the customer premises DSL modem and provides the data transported in the upstream DSL signal to the backbone server.

Digital subscriber line DSL diagnostic tools and methods to use the same are disclosed. A disclosed example DSL diagnostic tool includes a data collector to automatically collect real time performance data associated with a subscriber a database interface module to automatically collect historical data associated with the subscriber and to collect performance data associated with a neighbor subscriber line a data analyzer to automatically analyze the real time and historical performance data associated with the subscriber and the performance data associated with the neighbor subscriber line to identify a potential problem with an analyzed subscriber line associated with the subscriber and a trouble ticket system interface module to automatically submit a repair ticket when the data analyzer does not identify a potential problem.

A disclosed example method of analyzing the performance of a first digital subscriber line DSL subscriber line includes collecting real time performance data associated with the first subscriber line collecting historical data associated with the first subscriber line and to collect performance data associated with a neighbor subscriber line analyzing the real time and historical performance data associated with the first subscriber line and the performance data associated with the neighbor subscriber line to automatically identify a potential problem with the first subscriber line and automatically submitting a repair ticket when the potential problem is not automatically determined.

A disclosed example digital subscriber line DSL communication system includes a subscriber line to communicatively couple a customer premises DSL modem to a DSL access multiplexer a trouble ticket system and a DSL diagnostic tool to collect performance data associated with the subscriber line and a neighbor subscriber line to automatically analyze the collected performance data to identify a potential problem with the subscriber line and to automatically submit a repair ticket when the potential problem is not automatically identified.

In the interest of brevity and clarity throughout the following disclosure references will be made to connecting a digital subscriber line DSL modem and or a DSL communication service to a customer premises customer and or subscriber. However it will be readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art that connecting a DSL modem to a customer premises customer and or subscriber involves for example connecting a first DSL modem operated by a communications company e.g. a central office CO DSL modem implemented by a DSL access multiplexer DSLAM to a second DSL modem located at for example a customer premises e.g. a home and or place of business owned leased and or operated by a customer via a twisted pair telephone line i.e. a subscriber line . The customer premises e.g. the second DSL modem may be further connected to other communication and or computing devices e.g. a personal computer a set top box etc. that the customer uses and or operates to access a service e.g. Internet access Internet protocol IP Television TV etc. via the CO DSL modem the customer premises DSL modem the subscriber line and the communications company.

Moreover while methods and apparatus to test a subscriber line for a DSL service are described herein persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the example methods and apparatus may additionally or alternatively be used to test other wires and or cables for other communication services. Other example wires and or cables include but are not limited to those associated with public switched telephone network PSTN systems public land mobile network PLMN systems e.g. cellular wireless distribution systems wired or cable distribution systems coaxial cable distribution systems Ultra High Frequency UHF Very High Frequency VHF radio frequency systems satellite or other extra terrestrial systems cellular distribution systems power line broadcast systems fiber optic networks passive optical network PON systems and or any combination and or hybrid of these devices systems and or networks.

In the illustrated example of the DSLAM provides DSL services to the DSL modems and via respective subscriber lines and . Subscriber lines are sometimes also referred to in the industry as wire pairs and or loops. While throughout this disclosure reference is made to the example subscriber lines and or of persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that a subscriber line e.g. either or both of the example subscriber lines and used to provide a DSL service to a customer premises location e.g. either or both of the locations and may include and or be constructed from one or more segments of twisted pair telephone wire e.g. a combination of a feeder one F1 cable a distribution cable a drop cable and or customer premises wiring terminals and or distributions points e.g. a serving area interface SAI a serving terminal a vault and or a pedestal . Such segments of twisted pair telephone wire may be spliced and or connected end to end and or may be connected at only one end thereby creating one or more bridged taps. Regardless of the number type s gauge s and or topology of twisted pair telephone wires used to construct the example subscriber lines and they will be referred to herein in the singular form but it will be understood that the term subscriber line may refer to one or more twisted pair telephone wire segments and may include one or more bridged taps.

In traditional DSL communication systems DSL services are installed tested and or diagnosed using a series of manual and thus inherently error prone diagnostic steps. For example to install a DSL service a technician a uses a handheld and or portable device to measure the quality of a subscriber line b connects a DSL modem to the subscriber line c obtains performance data from the DSL modem using a data acquisition tool and d writes the data down for further analysis. If the technician feels the performance data may represent a problem with the newly installed DSL service they have to manually collect additional data e.g. for neighbor DSL lines analyze the additional data and if a problem cannot be readily identified submit a repair ticket. Such traditional processes are inherently error prone and have success rates that are highly dependent on the experience of the technician. Moreover traditional methods are focused on a particular subscriber line and thus may not correctly and or readily identify a problem affecting multiple subscriber lines. When such common problems are not rapidly identified and or addressed perceived customer satisfaction may be negatively impacted.

To test a subscriber line e.g. one of the example subscriber lines and or the example DSL communication system of includes a DSL diagnostic tool . In response to a subscriber and or customer identifier e.g. provided by a technician service person and or customer service person via a web based client browser and or when a DSL service associated with the identifier is being installed tested and or diagnosed the example DSL diagnostic tool of automatically collects historical and or real time performance data associated with the identifier e.g. collected from one of the example DSLAMs a customer premises DSL modem associated with the identifier and or a DSL performance database . Using the collected performance data the example DSL diagnostic tool attempts to automatically identify a potential problem e.g. a bridged tap a cable fault cross talk electromagnetic interference etc. for the subscriber line associated with the identifier. If a potential problem can be automatically identified the example DSL diagnostic tool provides the identified potential problem to the user of the web based client browser via which the subscriber identifier was provided. If a potential problem cannot be automatically identified the example DSL diagnostic tool of automatically generates and or submits a repair ticket to a trouble ticket system so that an appropriate technician can be dispatched to further diagnose the problem. An example manner of implementing the example DSL diagnostic tool of is described below in connection with .

The example DSL diagnostic tool of may additionally or alternatively collect performance data associated with neighbor subscriber lines associated with the particular subscriber line being installed tested and or diagnosed. Example neighbor subscriber lines are subscriber lines that share all or any part s of an F1 cable a distribution cable a drop cable a wiring terminal and or a distributions point e.g. a serving area interface SAI a serving terminal a vault and or a pedestal with the subscriber line being investigated. Because neighbor subscriber lines share at least part of a cable terminal and or distribution point performance data associated with one or more neighbor subscriber lines can be compared with performance data associated with the subscriber line to identify a potential problem with the given subscriber line and or to identify a potential problem that affects more than one subscriber line. The correlation and or consistency of subscriber line performance data can be used to automatically identify a most probable network element and or network location e.g. a wiring terminal hit by a vehicle thus affecting multiple subscribers or a fault in a drop cable affecting a single subscriber that is in need of repair. For example if the subscriber line and the neighbor subscriber lines each have current performance data that is worse than their historical performance data by a threshold then a problem if it exist likely affects more than just the subscriber line being analyzed. In another example when the performance of the subscriber line falls below the performance of each of its neighbor subscriber lines by a threshold amount the potential problem is identified as only affecting the subscriber line. When a repair is affected the repair may in fact restore and or improve DSL service to more than one subscriber line even though an initial service disruption notification was received for a single subscriber line.

To collect performance data from the example DSLAMs and or customer premises DSL modems communicatively couple to the DSLAMs the example CO of includes an access management system AMS server . The example AMS server provides and or implements an application programming interface API via which the example DSL diagnostic tool can obtain performance data associated with a particular port e.g. a particular CO DSL modem of a DSLAM and or a customer premises DSL modem communicatively coupled to the DSLAM port. The example AMS server accesses and or uses one or more APIs implemented and or provided by the DSLAMs to obtain the performance data from the DSLAMs .

To identify a customer premises DSL modem and or a DSLAM port associated with a subscriber identifier the example DSL diagnostic tool of queries the example DSL performance database . In addition to storing historical and or real time performance data associated with each of a plurality of subscriber lines e.g. estimated loop lengths DSL connection rates loop attenuation values error rates signal to noise ratios bit allocations noise margins maximum attainable data rates DSL modem configurations etc. the example DSL performance database stores associations of subscriber identifiers to DSLAM ports.

As illustrated in a client browser used to access control and or use the example DSL diagnostic tool may be communicatively coupled to the DSL diagnostic tool via a customer premises DSL modem a subscriber line and or a DSLAM . Additionally or alternatively a client browser may be coupled to the DSL diagnostic tool via one or more private and or public communication network s e.g. a local area network LAN implemented within and or by the example CO .

While in the illustrated example of the example DSLAMs the example DSL diagnostic tool the example client browser the example DSL performance database the example trouble ticket system and the example AMS server are illustrated in connection with the example CO one or more of the DSL diagnostic tool the client browser the DSL performance database the trouble ticket system and or the AMS server may be located and or implemented separately from the CO . For example the DSL diagnostic tool the client browser the DSL performance database and or the trouble ticket system may be located and or implemented at a customer service location not shown which is communicatively coupled to the AMS at the CO . Further any number of DSLAMs may be implemented and or located at a CO. Moreover a DSLAM may be implemented and or located at a remote terminal not shown which is communicatively coupled to the example DSL diagnostic tool via an AMS server e.g. the example AMS server at a CO e.g. the example CO .

To interact with the example trouble ticket system the example DSL diagnostic tool of includes a ticket system interface module . The example ticket system interface module of generates and or submits repair tickets for a subscriber identifier received via the example web based user interface module . In some examples the ticket system interface module includes performance data associated with a subscriber identifier its neighbor subscriber lines and or one or more parameters and or diagnostic information determined and or estimated e.g. computed based on the performance data. Included information may be used by for example a repair technician while diagnosing a reported problem.

To interact with the example performance database the example DSL diagnostic tool of includes a database interface module . The example database interface module of implements one or more APIs to allow other elements of the example DSL diagnostic tool to perform queries of the example performance database . Example queries include a to obtain a DSLAM port identifier associated with a subscriber identifier b to obtain historical performance data associated with a subscriber identifier c to obtain historical performance data associated with a neighbor subscriber line and or d to store collected real time performance data.

To collect data from a DSLAM e.g. any of the example DSLAMS of the example DSL diagnostic tool of includes a data collection module . The example data collection module of accesses an API implemented and or provided by the example AMS server to obtain current and or real time performance data for one or more ports of a DSLAM.

To analyze performance data the example DSL diagnostic tool of includes a data analysis module . When a subscriber identifier is received via the example web based user interface the example data analysis module of directs the database interface module to perform a query of the example DSL performance database to determine which DSLAM port is associated with the subscriber identifier. The example data analysis module then automatically collects real time performance data from the identified DSLAM port via the data collection module and performs another query of the DSL performance database to obtain historical performance data associated with the subscriber identifier and or DSLAM port. Based on the collected real time and or historical performance data the data analysis module attempts to automatically identify a potential problem e.g. a bridged tap a cable fault cross talk electromagnetic interference etc. for the subscriber line associated with the identifier. If a potential problem can be automatically identified by the data analysis module the example web based user interface module provides the identified potential problem to the user of the web based client browser . If a potential problem cannot be automatically identified the example ticket system interface module automatically generates and or submits a repair ticket to the example trouble ticket system so that one or more appropriate technicians can be dispatched to further diagnose the problem. An example manner of implementing the example data analysis tool of is described below in connection with .

The example data analysis tool of may additionally or alternatively perform one or more additional queries of the DSL performance database to collect performance data associated with one or more subscriber lines that neighbor the subscriber identifier. A neighbor subscriber line is any line in physical proximity to the subscriber line in question anywhere along the length of the subscriber line. Thus a neighbor line need not but may be coupled to a neighboring customer premises. If a comparison of the performance data associated with the subscriber identifier and performance data associated with one or more neighbor subscriber lines permits the data analysis module to automatically determine a potential problem the web based user interface module provides the identified potential problem to the user of the web based client browser . If a potential problem cannot be automatically identified the example ticket system interface module automatically generates and or submits a repair ticket to the example trouble ticket system so that one or more appropriate technicians can be dispatched to further diagnose the problem.

Further the example web based user interface module the example ticket system interface module the example database interface module the example data collection module the example data analysis module and or more generally the example DSL diagnostic tool of may be implemented by hardware software firmware and or any combination of hardware software and or firmware. Further still the example DSL diagnostic tool may include one or more elements processes and or devices in addition to or instead of those illustrated in and or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated elements processes and devices.

To compare the performance data associated with two or more subscriber lines the example line performance analyzer includes a neighbor line analyzer. The example neighbor line analyzer of compares historical and or real time performance data of two or more subscriber lines to attempt to automatically identify whether a potential problem may be affecting some or all of the compared subscriber lines. For example if all of a set of subscriber lines have lower current performance compared to historical averages e.g. a decrease in performance that exceeds a threshold a common network problem is likely affecting these modems.

To characterize the configuration of a subscriber line the example data analysis module of includes a loop quality analyzer . Using any method s algorithm s and or logic and based on collected performance data e.g. loop attenuation values the example loop quality analyzer of estimates one or more parameters of the subscriber line e.g. loop length bridged tap length cable fault cable short cable disconnected open bad splice loading coil etc. . Example methods and apparatus to estimate one or more parameter of a subscriber line given one or more signal attenuation values are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 751 353 filed on May 21 2007 and entitled Methods and Apparatus to Characterize a Digital Subscriber Line DSL Subscriber Loop. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 751 353 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

To identify operating conditions of a subscriber line the example data analysis module of includes a loop condition analyzer . Using any method s algorithm s and or logic and based on collected performance data e.g. signal to noise ratios bit allocations etc. the example loop condition analyzer of estimates the presence of one or more environmental conditions e.g. crosstalk electromagnetic interference AM radio signals interference from home electronic devices etc. that may be affecting the performance of the subscriber line. For example a DSL signal s bit allocation may be used to detect and or estimate the presence of different types of crosstalk and or interference by a identifying dips and or peaks in a bit allocation and or b correlating the shape and or location of the dips and or peaks with different types of crosstalk and or interference. For instance a DSL signal that is generally free of crosstalk has a bit distribution that peaks between 170 kHz and 300 kHz and gradually decreases for higher frequencies. However if crosstalk due to a nearby integrated services digital network ISDN signal is present then the peak of the DSL signal s bit allocation will peak either below 70 kHz or above 300 kHz facilitating detection of the ISDN crosstalk.
