Met was cloned named Cooper et al. 1984 311 29 33 and identified as an oncogene Park et al. 1986 Cell 45 895 904 . When deregulated by overexpression or mutations Met receptor tyrosine kinase leads to tumor growth and invasion Cristiani et al. 2005 Biochem. 44 14110 14119 .

Protein kinases PK are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine serine and threonine residues of proteins by transfer of the terminal gamma phosphate from ATP. Through signal transduction pathways these enzymes modulate cell growth differentiation and proliferation i.e. virtually all aspects of cell life in one way or another depend on PK activity. Furthermore abnormal PK activity has been related to a host of disorders ranging from relatively non life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma brain cancer . Protein kinases include two classes protein tyrosine kinases PTK and serine threonine kinases STK .

One of the prime aspects of PTK activity is their involvement with growth factor receptors which are cell surface proteins. When bound by a growth factor ligand growth factor receptors are converted to an active form which interacts with proteins on the inner surface of a cell membrane. This leads to phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of the receptor and other proteins and to the formation inside the cell of complexes with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that in turn effect numerous cellular responses such as cell division proliferation cell differentiation cell growth expression of metabolic effects to the extracellular microenvironment etc. For a more complete discussion see Schlessinger and Ullrich 1992 Neuron 9 303 391.

Growth factor receptors with PTK activity are known as receptor tyrosine kinases RTK Plowman et al. 1994 DN P 7 6 334 339 which comprise a large family of transmembrane receptors with diverse biological activity. At present at least nineteen 19 distinct subfamilies of RTK have been identified. An example of these is the subfamily designated the HER RTK which include EGFR epithelial growth factor receptor HER2 HER3 and HER4. These RTK consist of an extracellular glycosylated ligand binding domain a transmembrane domain and an intracellular cytoplasmic catalytic domain that can phosphorylate tyrosine residues on proteins. Another RTK subfamily consists of insulin receptor IR insulin like growth factor I receptor IGF 1R and insulin receptor related receptor IRR . IR and IGF 1R interact with insulin IGF I and IGF II to form a heterotetramer of two entirely extracellular glycosylated alpha subunits and two beta subunits which cross the cell membrane and which contain the tyrosine kinase domain. A third RTK subfamily is referred to as the platelet derived growth factor receptor PDGFR group which includes PDGFR alpha PDGFR beta CSFIR c kit and c fms. These receptors consist of glycosylated extracellular domains composed of variable numbers of immunoglobin like loops and an intracellular domain wherein the tyrosine kinase domain is interrupted by unrelated amino acid sequences. Another group which because of its similarity to the PDGFR subfamily is sometimes subsumed into the later group is the fetus liver kinase flk receptor subfamily. This group is believed to be made up of kinase insert domain receptor fetal liver kinase 1 KDR FLK 1 flk 1R flk 4 and fins like tyrosine kinase 1 flt 1 . Another member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the fibroblast growth factor FGF receptor subgroup. This group consists of four receptors FGFR1 4 and seven ligands FGF1 7. While not yet well defined it appears that these receptors consist of a glycosylated extracellular domain containing a variable number of immunoglobin like loops and an intracellular domain in which the tyrosine kinase sequence is interrupted by regions of unrelated amino acid sequences. Still another member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF receptor subgroup. VEGF is a dimeric glycoprotein similar to PDGF but has different biological functions and target cell specificity in vivo. In particular VEGF is presently thought to play an essential role is vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.

Met is still another member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family and often referred to as c Met or human hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase hHGFR . The expression of c Met is thought to play a role in primary tumor growth and metastasis Kim et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003 9 14 5161 5170 .

Modulation of the HGF c Met signaling pathway may be effected by regulating binding of HGF beta chain to cMet. In particular embodiments the zymogen like form of HGF beta mutant was shown to bind Met with 14 fold lower affinity than the wild type serine protease like form suggesting optimal interactions result from conformational changes upon cleavage of the single chain form US 2005 0037431 . Extensive mutagenesis of the HGF beta region corresponding to the active site and activation domain of serine proteases showed that 17 of the 38 purified two chain HGF mutants resulted in impaired cell migration or Met phosphorylation but no loss in Met binding. However reduced biological activities were well correlated with reduced Met binding of corresponding mutants of HGF beta itself in assays eliminating dominant alpha chain binding contributions.

Protein tyrosine kinases PTK are critical components of signaling pathways that control cellular proliferation and differentiation. PTK are subdivided into two large families receptor tyrosine kinases RTK and non receptor tyrosine kinases NRTK . RTK span the plasma membrane and contain an extra cellular domain which binds ligand and an intracellular portion which possesses catalytic activity and regulatory sequences. Most RTK like the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c met possess a single polypeptide chain and are monomeric in the absence of a ligand. Ligand binding to the extracellular portion of RTK dimerizes monomeric receptors resulting in autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic portion for review see Blume Jensen P. and Hunter T. Nature 2001 411 355 365 Hubbard S. R. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 273 1998 11987 11990 Zwick E. et al. Trends Mol. Med. 2002 8 17 23 . In general tyrosine autophosphorylation either stimulates the intrinsic catalytic kinase activity of the receptor or generates recruitment sites for downstream signaling proteins containing phosphotyrosine recognition domains such as the Src homology 2 SH2 domain or the phosphotyrosine binding PTB domain.

PTK have become primary targets for the development of novel therapeutics designed to block cancer cell proliferation metastasis and angiogenesis and promote apoptosis. The strategy that has progressed farthest in clinical development is the use of monoclonal antibodies to target growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. The use of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors however could have significant theoretical advantages over monoclonal antibodies. Small molecule inhibitors could have better tissue penetration could have activity against intracellular targets and mutated targets and could be designed to have oral bioavailability. Several lead compounds have shown promising activity against such targets as the EGFR the vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor and bcr abl. The hepatocyte growth factor receptor c Met was first identified as an activated oncogene in an N methyl N nitrosoguanidinic treated human osteogenic sarcoma cell line MUNG HOS by its ability to transform NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. The receptor encoded by the c Met protooncogene located on chromosome 7 is a two chain protein composed of 50 kDa alpha chain disulfide linked to a 145 kDa beta chain in an alpha beta complex of 190 kDa. The alpha chain is exposed at the cell surface while the beta chain spans the cell membrane and possesses an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of this intracellular tyrosine kinase domain groups c Met as a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase RTK family of cell surface molecules.

Much evidence supports the role of HGF as a regulator of carcinogenesis cancer invasion and metastasis for review see Herynk M. H. and Radinsky R. 2000 In Vivo 14 587 596 Jiang et al. 1999 Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 29 209 248 Longati 2001 Curr. Drug Targets 2 41 55 Maulik et al. 2002 Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 13 41 59 Parr C. and Jiang W. G. 2001 Histol. Histopathol. 16 251 268 . HGF binds to and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the mature c met receptor beta chain. Such events are thought to promote binding of intracellular signaling proteins containing src homology SH regions such as PLC gamma Ras GAP PI 3 kinase ppc src and the GRB 2 Socs complex to the activated receptor. Each SH2 containing protein may activate a different subset of signaling phosphopeptides thus eliciting different responses within the cell. c Met mutations have been well described in hereditary and sporadic human papillary renal carcinomas and have been reported in ovarian cancer childhood hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and gastric cancer. c Met is also over expressed in both non small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer cells in lung breast colon and prostate tumors Herynk et al. 2003 Cancer Res. 63 11 2990 2996 Maulik et al. 2002 Clin. Cancer Res. 8 620 627 . Since c Met appears to play an important role in oncogenesis of a variety of tumors various inhibition strategies have been employed to therapeutically target this receptor tyrosine kinase. The usefulness of inhibiting the protein tyrosine kinase c Met for inhibiting tumor growth and invasion has been shown in many well documented preclinical experiments Abounader et al. 1999 J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 91 1548 1556 Laterra et al. 1997 Lab. Invest. 76 565 577 Tomioka D. 2001 Cancer Res. 61 7518 7524 Wang et al. 2001 J. Cell Biology 153 1023 1033 .

Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include but are not limited to compounds of the invention and chemotherapeutic agents such as described above.

A metabolite is a product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof. Metabolites of a compound may be identified using routine techniques known in the art and their activities determined using tests such as those described herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation reduction hydrolysis amidation deamidation esterification deesterification enzymatic cleavage and the like of the administered compound. Accordingly the invention includes metabolites of compounds of the invention including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.

A liposome is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug such as the cMet inhibitors disclosed herein and optionally a chemotherapeutic agent to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes.

The term package insert is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products that contain information about the indications usage dosage administration contraindications and or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.

The term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

The term stereoisomers refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and l or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include but are not limited to sulfate citrate acetate oxalate chloride bromide iodide nitrate bisulfate phosphate acid phosphate isonicotinate lactate salicylate acid citrate tartrate oleate tannate pantothenate bitartrate ascorbate succinate maleate gentisinate fumarate gluconate glucuronate saccharate formate benzoate glutamate methanesulfonate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate p toluenesulfonate and pamoate i.e. 1 1 methylene bis 2 hydroxy 3 naphthoate salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and or one or more counter ion.

The compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib also include other salts of such compounds which are not necessarily pharmaceutically acceptable salts and which may be useful as intermediates for preparing and or purifying compounds of Formulas Ia or Ib and or for separating enantiomers of compounds of Formulas Ia or Ib.

If the compound of the invention is a base the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art for example treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid and the like or with an organic acid such as acetic acid maleic acid succinic acid mandelic acid fumaric acid malonic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid glycolic acid salicylic acid a pyranosidyl acid such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid an alpha hydroxy acid such as citric acid or tartaric acid an amino acid such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid an aromatic acid such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid a sulfonic acid such as p toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid or the like.

If the compound of the invention is an acid the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method for example treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base such as an amine primary secondary or tertiary an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or the like. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include but are not limited to organic salts derived from amino acids such as glycine and arginine ammonia primary secondary and tertiary amines and cyclic amines such as piperidine morpholine and piperazine and inorganic salts derived from sodium calcium potassium magnesium manganese iron copper zinc aluminum and lithium.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and or toxicologically with the other ingredients comprising a formulation and or the mammal being treated therewith.

A solvate refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include but are not limited to water isopropanol ethanol methanol DMSO ethyl acetate acetic acid and ethanolamine. The term hydrate refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.

The term protecting group or Pg refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound. For example an amino protecting group is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino protecting groups include acetyl trifluoroacetyl t butoxycarbonyl BOC benzyloxycarbonyl CBZ and 9 fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl Fmoc . Similarly a hydroxy protecting group refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable protecting groups include acetyl and silyl. A carboxy protecting group refers to a substituent of the carboxy group that blocks or protects the carboxy functionality. Common carboxy protecting groups include CHCHSOPh cyanoethyl 2 trimethylsilyl ethyl 2 trimethylsilyl ethoxymethyl 2 p toluenesulfonyl ethyl 2 p nitrophenylsulfenyl ethyl 2 diphenylphosphino ethyl nitroethyl and the like.

In the methods of preparing the compounds of this invention it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and or purified hereinafter separated to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture distillation sublimation or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including for example reverse phase and normal phase size exclusion ion exchange high medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus small scale analytical simulated moving bed SMB and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.

Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product unreacted starting material reaction by product or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon molecular sieves ion exchange media or the like. Alternatively the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material bases in the case of an acidic material binding reagents such as antibodies binding proteins selective chelators such as crown ethers liquid liquid ion extraction reagents LIX or the like.

Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved.

One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.

Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher s acid chloride separating the diastereomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers e.g. substituted biaryls and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.

A single stereoisomer e.g. an enantiomer substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994 Lochmuller C. H. 1975 J. Chromatogr. 113 3 283 302 . Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method including 1 formation of ionic diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods 2 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents separation of the diastereomers and conversion to the pure stereoisomers and 3 separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See Drug Stereochemistry Analytical Methods and Pharmacology Irving W. Wainer Ed. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1993 .

Under method 1 diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine quinine ephedrine strychnine methyl phenylethylamine amphetamine and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids such as camphorsulfonic acid tartaric acid mandelic acid or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.

Alternatively by method 2 the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. 1994 p. 322 . Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents such as menthyl derivatives followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters such as a menthyl ester e.g. menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base or Mosher ester methoxy trifluoromethyl phenyl acetate Jacob III. J. Org. Chem. 1982 47 4165 of the racemic mixture and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal and reverse phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl isoquinolines WO 96 15111 . By method 3 a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase Chiral Liquid Chromatography 1989 W. J. Lough Ed. Chapman and Hall New York Okamoto J. Chromatogr. 1990 513 375 378 . Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.

The compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein such as a hyperproliferative disorder e.g. cancer . In certain embodiments a compound of Formula Ia or Ib is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen as combination therapy with a second compound that has anti hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating a hyperproliferative disorder e.g. cancer . The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of Formula Ia or Ib such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment a composition of this invention comprises a compound of Formula Ia or Ib or a stereoisomer geometric isomer tautomer solvate metabolite or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent such as described herein.

The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.

Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.

The combination therapy may provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.

In a particular embodiment of anti cancer therapy a compound of Formula Ia or Ib or a stereoisomer geometric isomer tautomer solvate metabolite or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof may be combined with other chemotherapeutic hormonal or antibody agents such as those described herein as well as combined with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of Formula Ia or Ib or a stereoisomer geometric isomer tautomer solvate metabolite or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. The amounts of the compound s of Formula Ia or Ib and the other pharmaceutically active chemotherapeutic agent s and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.

Also provided are compositions comprising a compound of Formula Ia or Ib in combination with an additional therapeutic agent selected from an anti proliferative agent an anti inflammatory agent an immunomodulatory agent a neurotropic factor an agent for treating cardiovascular disease an agent for treating liver disease an anti viral agent an agent for treating blood disorders an agent for treating diabetes or an agent for treating immunodeficiency disorders.

Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of heterobicyclic pyrazole compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib described herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation reduction hydrolysis amidation deamidation esterification deesterification enzymatic cleavage and the like of the administered compound. Accordingly the invention includes metabolites of compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.

Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled e.g. C or H isotope of a compound of the invention administering it parenterally in a detectable dose e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg kg to an animal such as rat mouse guinea pig monkey or to man allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours and isolating its conversion products from the urine blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite . The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion e.g. by MS LC MS or NMR analysis. In general analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.

In addition to compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib the invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of such compounds. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue or a polypeptide chain of two or more e.g. two three or four amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine phosphothreonine phosphotyrosine 4 hydroxyproline hydroxylysine demosine isodemosine gamma carboxyglutamate hippuric acid octahydroindole 2 carboxylic acid statine 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid penicillamine ornithine 3 methylhistidine norvaline beta alanine gamma aminobutyric acid cirtulline homocysteine homoserine methyl alanine para benzoylphenylalanine phenylglycine propargylglycine sarcosine methionine sulfone and tert butylglycine.

Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance a free carboxyl group of a compound of Formula Ia or Ib can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as but not limited to a phosphate ester hemisuccinate dimethylaminoacetate or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group as outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 1996 19 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included as are carbonate prodrugs sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as acyloxy methyl and acyloxy ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including but not limited to ether amine and carboxylic acid functionalities or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem. 1996 39 10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl 1 methyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl C C alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl N C C alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl succinoyl C C alkanoyl amino C C alkanoyl arylacyl and aminoacyl or aminoacyl aminoacyl where each aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L amino acids P O OH P O O C C alkyl or glycosyl the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate .

Free amine groups of compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib can also be derivatized as amides sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these moieties may incorporate groups including but not limited to ether amine and carboxylic acid functionalities. For example a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R carbonyl RO carbonyl NRR carbonyl wherein R and R are each independently C C alkyl C C cycloalkyl or benzyl or R carbonyl is a natural aminoacyl or natural aminoacyl natural aminoacyl C OH C O OY wherein Y is H C C alkyl or benzyl C OY Ywherein Yis C C alkyl and Yis C C alkyl carboxy C C alkyl amino C C alkyl or mono N or di N N C C alkylaminoalkyl or C Y Ywherein Yis H or methyl and Yis mono N or di N N C C alkylamino morpholino piperidin 1 yl or pyrrolidin 1 yl.

The reaction mixture is removed by washing and the phosphorylated polymer substrate is detected with 0.2 g mL phosphotyrosine specific monoclonal antibody PY20 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase HRP . After the addition of 1M phosphoric acid to stop the development the chromogenic substrate TMB color is quantitated by spectrophotometry at 450 nm. Certain compounds of this invention had IC s of less than 1 M in this assay.

The cellular activity of the compounds of the present invention may be determined by the following procedure. MKN45 cells were plated in Costar 3904 96 well plates in growth media RPMI 10 FBS at a density of 15000 cells well and incubated at 37 C. 5 COovernight. The following day one tenth volume of a 10 concentration of compounds was added to the wells in a 11 point dilution series. The dilutions series was composed of an initial 1 3 dilution in DMSO followed by a 1 20 dilution in HBSS for a final DMSO concentration on cells of 0.5 . Control wells were treated with 0.5 DMSO. The typical range of dilution was 5 M to 0.3 nM which was expanded to 25 M depending on the potency of the compound. Once compound was added to the cells plates were incubated for one hour at 37 C. 5 CO. Plates were then washed in PBS fixed in 4 formaldehyde and rehydrated with a 10 methanol solution. The plates were then blocked with Licor blocking buffer. The total phosphorylated cMet levels were measured by incubating with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated cMet followed by an anti rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680. Signal was normalized for differences in cell number by reference to the levels of the housekeeping protein GAPDH. Cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against GAPDH followed by an anti mouse antibody labeled with IRdye 800. Signal was measured on the Licor. The overall fluorescent signal from the Alexa Fluor 680 is normalized by dividing the value by the fluorescent value of the IRdye 800 signal. The fluorescent signal of the control wells was defined as 100 and the percent of inhibition of phosphorylated cMet was expressed as percent of control. ICvalues were determined from the percent of control data using a standard 4 parameter logistical model.
