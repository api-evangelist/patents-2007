title: Hardened pump laser and method of making the same
abstract: A hardened pump laser comprises a hardened pump chamber that combines the functions of a conventional flash lamp and a conventional laser cavity flow tube. The hardened pump chamber comprises a hardened filter tube and electrodes. The electrodes are sealed to the hardened filter tube. A chamber in the hardened filter tube is filled with gas through the electrodes, then sealed. The hardened pump chamber performs the laser pumping function while further performing filtering and diffusion functions.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The present invention generally relates to solid state laser systems. In particular the present invention relates to a pump chamber for a hardened pump laser system and more specifically to a pump chamber hardened to withstand a high shock and acceleration environment.

Laser ignition was developed by the U.S. government. One of the goals of laser ignition has been to increase the ability of the laser igniter to reliably ignite the propelling charge and increase safety. To date these systems typically comprise a solid state flash lamp pumped laser system.

The flash lamps excite the solid state laser rod causing the solid state laser rod to lase. The resonator comprises two mirrors one on either end of the solid state laser rod one of which is partially reflective. The resonator allows the laser beam to pass back and forth through the solid state laser rod amplifying the laser beam.

The laser cavity flow tube surrounds the flash lamp in a dimension radial to the flash lamp . Similarly the laser cavity flow tube surrounds the flash lamp in a dimension radial to the flash lamp . The laser cavity flow tubes filter out undesirable ultraviolet and infrared light emitted by the flash lamps . The laser cavity flow tubes further attenuate to a desired level the light energy applied to the solid state laser rod . Flash lamp leads connect the flash lamps to a power supply.

However due to the fragile nature of the solid state flash lamp pumped laser system breech mounted laser ignition systems are typically limited to environments with minimal shock and acceleration. Hardening a breech mounted laser ignition system to high shock and acceleration environments would allow the use of laser ignition for weaponry such as a 155 mm howitzer artillery weapon system which has high shock vibration and acceleration due to recoil. The most fragile portions of the solid state flash lamp pumped laser system are the flash lamps which are typically quartz flash lamps. Hardening the pump chamber would extend the applicability of laser ignition to the high shock and acceleration environment of a 155 mm howitzer artillery weapon system.

Thus there is need for a hardened pump laser and method of manufacturing the same. The need for such a system has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention satisfies this need and presents a system and an associated method collectively referred to herein as the system or the present system for a hardened pump laser and method of manufacturing the same.

The present system comprises a hardened pump chamber that comprises a hardened filter tube and electrodes. The electrodes are sealed to the hardened filter tube. A chamber in the hardened filter tube is filled with gas through the electrodes and is then sealed. The hardened pump chamber performs the laser pumping function of the conventional flash lamp while further performing the filtering and diffusion functions of the conventional laser cavity flow tube.

Compared to a conventional solid state flash lamp pumped laser the present system increases survivability for high shock and acceleration environments reduces parts count decreases overall size and improves laser efficiency. Compared to a conventional solid state flash lamp pumped laser of similar output power the present invention is approximately 25 smaller consumes approximately 50 75 less power and is approximately 50 75 more efficient.

Furthermore conventional solid state flash lamp pumped lasers require significant shock and vibration isolation to survive the high shock and acceleration environments of typical military applications. The present invention requires minimal or no shock and vibration isolation. The present invention can be used in any application that requires high output power in a small robust package such as for example laser range finders dental and optical laser systems laser welders and laser cutting machines.

The following definition and explanation provide background information pertaining to the technical field of the present invention and are intended to facilitate the understanding of the present invention without limiting its scope 

Harden to produce in a fashion capable of withstanding rough usage or extreme environments such as high shock acceleration or vibration.

The hardened filter tube replaces the conventional flash lamps and the conventional laser cavity flow tubes shown in . The hardened pump chamber generates light required to pump the solid state laser rod without requiring a fragile flash lamp or an additional laser cavity filter tube.

With further reference to it illustrates the representative hardened filter tube of the hardened pump chamber . The hardened filter tube comprises hardened glass comprising light filtering characteristics that filter ultraviolet and infrared from the light generated by the hardened pump chambers .

The hardened filter tube comprises an oval shaped body that generally defines three internal chambers . Chambers preferably have circular cross sections along their entire axial lengths. Chambers and are generally symmetrical relative to a geometric center of the internal chamber and thus only chamber will be described herein in more detail. Chamber is preferably smaller size than the internal chamber and has a geometric center .

Body is generally defined by an outer diameter OD of approximately 9.9 mm relative to the geometric center of chamber . Center of chamber is offset relative to center of chamber by a distance of approximately 8.5 mm. Chamber has an outer diameter ID of approximately 3.7 mm. Chamber is offset from body by a distance H of approximately 3 mm along axis YY. Chamber is offset from chamber by a distance H of approximately 3.1 mm along axis YY.

The hardened filter tube has an axial length of approximately 80 mm. Chamber is the laser rod location. Chambers and are preferably filled with Xenon at approximately 600 Torr.

Chamber is filled through electrode . Each of the electrodes is approximately 1.4 mm in diameter and approximately 8.25 mm in length. Xenon gas is passed through a fill hole in the fill tube to fill chamber . Fill hole has a diameter of approximately 0.5 mm. Fill tube is brazed with a braze joints with a 0.75 mm fillet to the electrode .

It is to be understood that the specific embodiments of the invention that have been described are merely illustrative of certain applications of the principle of the present invention. Numerous modifications may be made to a hardened pump laser and method of manufacturing the same described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
