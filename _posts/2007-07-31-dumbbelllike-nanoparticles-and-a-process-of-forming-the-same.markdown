This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10 938 897 filed Sep. 10 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 288 134 the complete disclosure of which in its entirety is herein incorporated by reference.

The invention was at least partially funded under Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA Contract No. N00014 01 1 0885 and the U.S. Government has at least some rights in this invention.

The embodiments of this invention generally relate to the synthesis of nanoscale objects and more particularly to the synthesis of nanoparticles.

Nanoscale objects with size of several hundred nanometers or less have promising potential in optic electronic magnetic and catalytic applications. Progression in the production of monodisperse noble metal Au Ag Pt and Pd semiconducting and magnetic nanoparticles has provided various systems suitable for nanooptic nanoelectronic and nanomagnetic studies in mapping the scaling limits of future information technology understanding spin dependent transport phenomena and using nanoparticles as highly sensitive labels both magnetic and optic for bio recognition.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 123 920 and 6 203 777 the complete disclosures of which in their entireties are herein incorporated by reference have suggested that nanoparticles with diameters smaller than 20 nm are ideal for biomedical applications. These small nanoparticles can in principle allow only one or several biomolecules especially DNA strands to attach and may be used as easily identified labels for future highly sensitive biomolecule separation and detection. Additionally noble metal nanoparticles especially Au nanoparticles can be used for site specific attachment of biomolecules such as DNA strands by using the high affinity of Au to a thiol group SH . Furthermore Au nanoparticles in a variety of size ranges have been synthesized and used for thiol terminated biomolecule attachment facilitating optic detection of the biomolecule via surface plasmon property of the Au nanoparticles. An alternative yet a potentially more sensitive approach involves using magnetic nanoparticles as tagging labels. The tagged biomolecules can be enriched separated or detected magnetically.

One recent research push has been in making nanoparticle labels with core shell type structure with the core being a magnet and the shell being Au as described by Lin J. et al Gold Coated Iron Fe Au Nanoparticles Synthesis Characterization and Magnetic Field Induced Self Assembly J. Solid State Chem. 159 26 2001 and Chen M. et al Gold coated Iron Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications J. Appl. Phys. Vol. 93 No. 10 7551 2003 the complete disclosures of which in their entireties are herein incorporated by reference. However the evidence for Au coating over a magnetic nanoparticle has been inconclusive thus far.

While the conventional structures have provided particle metal half shell structures via deposition of a thin metal film onto a spherical inorganic organic polymeric particle the conventional structures are generally much larger than 30 nm making them unsuitable for biomedical applications. Moreover a chemical solution phase has been used to form a structure containing FePt CdS CdSe Au and PdS CoS. However there continues to remain a need for the preparation of novel dumbbell like nanostructures with controlled functionality which can be used for various nanoelectronic and nanomagnetic applications including various biomedical applications.

In view of the foregoing an embodiment of the invention provides general techniques for making various types of water soluble dumbbell like nanoparticles having a portion comprising a magnetic identity including any of a metal alloy and metal oxide and a semiconductor with another portion comprising a noble metal including any of Au Ag Pd and Pt whereby the dumbbell like nanoparticles are capable of being implemented in biomedical and nanodevice applications.

An aspect of the invention provides a process of making nanoparticles wherein the process comprises forming a mixture of a nanoparticle with a precursor in a first solvent wherein the nanoparticle comprises a hydrophobic outer coating heating the mixture cooling the mixture to room temperature modifying the hydrophobic outer coating into a hydrophilic outer coating precipitating a solid product from the mixture and dispersing the product in a second solvent. The nanoparticles comprise any of dumbbell shaped nanoparticles and flower shaped nanoparticles. Additionally the nanoparticles comprise any of a semiconducting magnetic and noble metallic material wherein the nanoparticles comprise a first portion comprising any of PbSe PbS CdSe CdS ZnS Au Ag Pd and Pt and wherein the precursor comprises any of a cationic neutral or particulate Au Ag Pd Pt or transition metal Fe Co Ni precursors of Fe CO Co CO Ni CO or their analogues.

A further aspect of the invention provides a process of making dumbbell shaped nanoparticles wherein the process comprises mixing nanoparticles with a noble metal precursor and a reducing agent in solvent wherein each of the nanoparticles comprises a hydrophobic outer coating heating the mixture cooling the mixture to room temperature modifying the hydrophobic outer coating into a hydrophilic outer coating precipitating product from the mixture and dispersing the product in solvent to produce nanoparticle dispersion. The nanoparticles comprise any of metal alloy oxide and sulfide. The noble metal precursor comprises any of a cation or metal and nanoparticles comprising any of Au Ag Pd and Pt. The reducing agent comprises any of an amine alcohol aldehyde hydride and a metallic reducing agent. The solvent comprises any of alkanes arenes ethers nitriles ketones and chlorinated hydrocarbons.

Another embodiment of the invention provides a process of making dumbbell shaped nanoparticles wherein the process comprises applying a coating to a nanoparticle mixing the coated nanoparticle with a noble metal precursor and reducing agent in solvent to produce a mixture heating the mixture cooling the mixture to room temperature modifying the coating into a hydrophilic coating precipitating product from the mixture and dispersing the product in solvent to produce a nanocrystal dispersion. The coated material comprises any of sulfur selenium phosphorus and arsenic inclusive materials. Additionally the nanoparticles comprise any of a metal alloy oxide and sulfide. The noble metal precursor comprises any of a cation metal and nanoparticles comprising any of Au Ag Pd and Pt. The reducing agent comprises any of an amine alcohol aldehyde hydride and a metallic reducing agent. The solvent comprises any of alkanes arenes ethers nitrites ketones and chlorinated hydrocarbons.

A further embodiment of the invention provides a process of making dumbbell shaped nanoparticles water soluble wherein the process comprises combining a magnetic material with a metallic material to form a dumbbell shaped nanoparticles coating the nanoparticles with a hydrophobic outer layer and modifying a hydrophobic outer layer of the nanoparticles into a hydrophilic outer layer wherein the hydrophobic layer comprises any of hydrocarbons ethers and esters and wherein the hydrophilic layer comprises any of polar functional groups of OH COOH NH2 CON CN and ionic groups. The step of modifying comprises forming a bilayer structure of the nanoparticle. Additionally the step of modifying comprises using surfactant replacement to change the hydrophobic layer into the hydrophilic layer. Moreover the step of modifying is performed in a temperature ranging from room temperature to 150 C.

The dumbbell like nanoparticles provided by the embodiments of the invention have numerous advantages over currently used nanoparticle systems. They can be made easily from solution phase synthesis. The size of any one part in the dumbbell structure can be tuned. The structure has small noble metal surface from a dot of less than 5 nm for site specific binding of a single or at most a few biomolecules. The structure also has size tunable magnetic or semiconducting dot from which an optimum magnetic or optic signal can be generated and detected. Further such dumbbell structure may be used to connect two narrowly separated electrodes to form a nano contact between two electrodes a key step for future fabrication of spintronic devices.

Generally the embodiments of the invention provide a process of forming dumbbell shaped nanoparticles by mixing noble metal nanoparticles with a magnetic nanoparticle precursor. In other words the embodiments of the invention provide a colloidal nanoparticle comprising a magnetic portion a metallic portion adjacent to the magnetic portion and a modifiable hydrophobic outer layer over the magnetic portion and the metallic portion wherein the modifiable hydrophobic outer layer is adapted to be transformed into a hydrophilic outer layer and wherein each of the magnetic and metallic portions comprise surfaces adapted to be modified. Moreover the magnetic portion and the metallic portion are arranged in a dumbbell like configuration or flower like configuration.

These and other aspects of the embodiments of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the following descriptions while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof and the embodiments of the invention include all such modifications.

The embodiments of the invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments of the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments of the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments of the invention. Accordingly the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments of the invention.

As mentioned there remains a need for a novel nanostructure which can be used for various nanoelectronic and nanomagnetic applications including various biomedical applications. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there are shown preferred embodiments of the invention.

The basic chemistry for the formation of the dumbbell structure involves the noble metal attachment to the previously formed particle surface that includes an element for noble metal attachment. Sulfur S and Selenium Se are preferably used to form a strong chemical bond with the noble metal such as Gold Au or Silver Ag . Thus either metal sulfide MS nanoparticles or metal selenide MSe nanoparticles can offer the surface containing the S element and Se element facilitating Au or Ag attachment. For nanoparticles without an S or Se element on the surface they may be coated with a layer of metal sulfide or metal selenide. By carefully modifying the surface properties various dumbbell like nanostructures can be made in accordance with the embodiments of the invention.

In another embodiment the dumbbell like multi functional nanoparticles made from an organic solution phase are coated with a layer of hydrocarbon surfactant for nanoparticle stabilization in the solvent. This hydrocarbon coating makes the nanoparticles hydrophobic i.e. they can only be dispersed in non polar or weakly polar solvent such as alkane benzene toluene and aromatic solvent. Moreover the hydrophobic surfactant around each dumbbell nanoparticle can be replaced by a hydrophilic surfactant resulting in water soluble and biocompatible nanoparticles which can be dispensed into a polar solvent such as ethanol methanol or water for example as shown in . Additionally the noble metal can be used for site specific attachment to bio molecules as shown in which illustrates dumbbell like nanoparticle with different coatings L and L .

This will allow nanoparticles to attach to a magnetic sensor surface for highly sensitive bio recognition as shown in where L is the biomolecule in interest and L can be any hydrophilic surfactant. For example L can be a two strand DNA fragment or an antibody antigen antibody sandwich structure. Alternatively the organic surfactant around each particle can be removed and the particle can be attached to a patterned electrode containing noble metal such as gold. The presence of gold in a dumbbell nanoparticle will facilitate particle attachment to this electrode by gentle annealing it to allow an interface diffusion to occur between the gold sphere and the gold electrode. This aids in building a connection between two electrodes with only one particle either a magnetic or semiconducting nanoparticle as shown in resulting in novel spintronic and single electron devices. For example the magnetic nanoparticle could affect spin dependent transport between the two electrodes often made magnetic . In addition the nanoparticles are configured sufficiently small such that the electronic transport between the two electrodes via the nanoparticles becomes quantized because of Coulomb blockade. In other words the nanoparticles can act as a quantum dot in single electronic devices.

Experimentally semiconductor nanoparticles have been constructed by attaching Au nanoparticles from an organic solution phase synthesis based on scheme FIG. A or magnetic nanoparticles attached by Ag or Au nanoparticles based on Schemes . PbSe nanoparticles may be synthesized using any known procedure such as that described in Murray C. B. et al Colloidal Synthesis of Nanocrystals and Nanocrystal Superlattices IBM J. Res. Dev. Vol. 45 No. 1 47 2001 the complete disclosure of which in its entirety is herein incorporated by reference. PbSe offers a surface that includes Se facilitating Au attachment. Thus mixing these PbSe particles with HAuClsalt in the presence of oleylamine and stirring the mixture at 40 C. for 1 hour yields PbSe Au dumbbell nanoparticles according to the embodiments of the invention.

The embodiments of the invention provide multi shaped nanoparticles such as FeO Au dumbbell like particles shown in the TEM image of and FeO Au flower like nanoparticles shown in the TEM image of which can be made by decomposing Fe CO over Au nanoparticles. In the lighter part of the image s corresponds with FeOwhile the darker part of the image s corresponds with Au.

To make FeO FeS Ag dumbbell nanoparticles iron oxide nanoparticles are constructed using any suitable method such as that described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 124 078 the complete disclosure of which in its entirety is herein incorporated by reference. Then the oxide surface is modified with thiol. An HS group can attach to the iron oxide surface at a high temperature. SH Fe linkage decomposes to give a FeS species on the particle surface. The FeS modified FeOnanoparticles are then mixed with silver nitrate salt which is dissolved in solvent tetralin in the presence of an alkylamine. By heating the mixture to 100 C. for 1 hour dumbbell like FeO FeS Ag nanoparticles are synthesized.

As synthesized the dumbbell like nanoparticles as produced according to the embodiments of the invention are surrounded by a layer of hydrocarbon originated from oleic acid and an oleylamine. The presence of hydrocarbon makes the nanoparticles hydrophobic dispersed only in non polar or weakly polar solvent. By shaking a hexane dispersion of hydrophobic nanoparticles with an aqueous solution of EtNOH and HS CH COONEt the nanoparticles can be transformed in water. HS CH COONEtreplaces the long chain hydrocarbon surfactant around each particle and makes the particle hydrophilic and can be dispersed in various polar solvents such as water and methanol. The nanoparticles in water can be precipitated out by adding acetone and can be separated using a magnet. The precipitate can then be washed with acetone and re dissolved with water giving a clean water dispersion of the particles with a pH of approximately 7.

The solution is heated at 40 C. for 1 hour. The PbSe Au dumbbell shaped nanoparticles are then separated from solution by adding ethanol and centrifugation. The particles are re dispersed in any of the following organic solvents including toluene hexane butyl ether etc. Similarly various A B dumbbell shaped nanoparticles can be made with A comprising any of semiconducting PbS CdSe CdS etc and B comprising any of Au Ag Pt and Pd.

The gold nanoparticles are then separated from solution by adding ethanol and centrifugation. Au FeOdumbbell shaped particles with Au comprising 8 nm Au and FeOcomprising 15 nm are formed by injecting 0.14 ml Fe CO 1 mmol into a solution of oleyl acid 1.0 ml 3 mmol in 20 ml octadecene at 130 C.

The mixture is heated to 100 C. to remove the hexane and to reflux for 30 minutes. The heating source is removed and the black reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature. Ethanol is then added. The black product is precipitated and separated by centrifugation. Next the yellow brown supernatant is discarded and the black product is dispersed in hexane in the presence of oleic acid and oleyl amine. Any unsolved precipitation is removed by centrifugation. The FeS modified FeOnanocrystals are precipitated out by adding ethanol and centrifugation and can be easily re dispersed in alkane solvent aromatic solvent and chlorinated solvent.

The aqueous solution becomes reddish brown and the hexane phase is discolored. The hexane is then removed and acetone is added to the aqueous solution until the solution become cloudy. The product is separated with a magnet and washed with acetone once. The product is then dispersed into water to produce a reddish brown solution with a pH of approximately 7. Additionally similar processes can be applied to other dumbbell shaped nanoparticles to make them water soluble.

A further aspect of the invention illustrated in provides a process of making dumbbell shaped nanoparticles wherein the process comprises mixing magnetic nanoparticles A with a noble metal precursor B and a reducing agent in solvent wherein each of the nanoparticles comprises a hydrophobic outer coating heating the mixture cooling the mixture to room temperature modifying the hydrophobic outer coating into a hydrophilic outer coating precipitating product from the mixture and dispersing the product in solvent to produce nanoparticle dispersion.

Another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in which provides a process of making dumbbell shaped nanoparticles wherein the process comprises applying a coating to a nanoparticle A with a hydrophobic coating mixing the coated nanoparticle A with a noble metal precursor B and reducing agent in solvent to produce a mixture heating the mixture cooling the mixture to room temperature modifying the coating into a hydrophilic coating precipitating product from the mixture and dispersing the product in solvent to produce a nanocrystal dispersion. The coated material comprises any of sulfur selenium phosphorus and arsenic inclusive materials. Additionally the nanoparticles A comprise any of a metal alloy oxide and sulfide. The noble metal precursor B comprises any of a cation metal and nanoparticles comprising any of Au Ag Pd and Pt.

The structure depicted in and the processes described in Scheme and Scheme as well as the above described example can be readily extended to the synthesis of more complicated dumbbell like nanoparticles with A or B comprising any of an elemental metal alloy or mixture metal oxide metal sulfide metal selenide or polymeric form particles with the sizes of both A and B being tunable. Additionally the nanoparticle materials may be implemented in several applications such as ferrofluid data storage sensor biomedical imaging drug delivery bio detection and catalysis.

The embodiments of the invention provide a dumbbell like nanostructure with one part of the dumbbell being magnetic or semiconducting and another part being noble metallic. The bifunctionality introduced by such a dumbbell structure could be used for various nanoelectronic and nanomagnetic applications. Moreover the magnetic detection provided by the embodiments of the invention is capable of yielding a biosensor suitable for single biomolecule detection. For example to make magnetic nanoparticles for sensitive bio label applications nanoparticles are made that can site specifically bind to a DNA strand. The surface area for site specific binding is preferably small to ensure that only one or at most several biomolecules can be accommodated around the particle surface. Further to facilitate the magnetic detection the magnetic particles are preferably superparamagnetic with a high moment and high permeability.

The dumbbell like nanoparticles provided by the embodiments of the invention have numerous advantages over currently used nanoparticle systems. They can be made easily from solution phase synthesis. The size of any one part in the dumbbell structure can be tuned. The structure has small noble metal surface from a dot of less than 5 nm for site specific binding of a single or at most a few biomolecules. The structure also has size tunable magnetic or semiconducting dot from which an optimum magnetic or optic signal can be generated and detected. Further such dumbbell structure may be used to connect two narrowly separated electrodes to form a nano contact between two electrodes a key step for future fabrication of spintronic devices.

Generally the embodiments of the invention provide a colloidal nanoparticle comprising a magnetic portion a metallic portion adjacent to the magnetic portion and a modifiable hydrophobic outer layer over the magnetic portion and the metallic portion wherein the modifiable hydrophobic outer layer is adapted to be transformed into a hydrophilic outer layer and wherein each of the magnetic and metallic portions comprise surfaces adapted to be modified. Moreover the magnetic portion and the metallic portion are arranged in a dumbbell like configuration or flower like configuration. The dumbbell shaped colloidal nanoparticles provided by the embodiments of the invention are unique from the widely studied core shell structures because the dumbbell shaped nanoparticles comprise two different surfaces that provide two platforms for different surface chemistry in one particle. Such a characteristic is currently not available for core shell structures that have only one type of surface. Furthermore the embodiments of the invention provide the first known example of a flower shaped nanoparticle. The advantage of this flower like structure is that one single particle provides a stronger magnetic signal than conventional nanoparticles. That is the totality of several petal flower like magnetic nanoparticles which maintains chemical solubility is unique. Generally the flower shape nanoparticles comprise a plurality of dumbbell shaped nanoparticles arranged in a flower like shape.

Conversely for conventional nanoparticles in order to provide a magnetic signal comparable to the magnetic signal provided by the flower shaped nanoparticles of the embodiments of the invention the size of the conventional nanoparticles would have to be configured much too large to be soluble. Furthermore the conventional nanoparticles in such a configuration would become ferromagnetic instead of superparamagnetic. In addition a flower shaped nanoparticle has a free gold surface for surfactant attachment that is otherwise unavailable in a conventional core shell structure. Accordingly the embodiments of the invention provide the example of nanoparticles having dumbbell and flower shaped structures comprising a magnetic particle as the first part and a metal portion as the second part and having both surfaces magnetic and metal surfaces available for surface modification which is different from that of a conventional core shell structure having only one type of surface available for modification.

The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can by applying current knowledge readily modify and or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept and therefore such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments. It is to be understood that the phraseology or terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation. Therefore while the embodiments of the invention have been described in terms of preferred embodiments those skilled in the art will recognize that the embodiments of the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
