The present application is a National Stage filing and claims priority to International Application No. PCT EP2007 005594 filed Jun. 25 2007 entitled VEHICLE SEAT COMPRISING A SEAT PART AND AN ANTI SUBMARINING RESTRAINT DEVICE RESTRAINT DEVICE AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE which claims priority to German Patent Application No. DE 10 2006 029 299.5 filed Jun. 23 2006 the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to a vehicle seat with a seat section and with a restraint device for preventing submarining of a passenger on the vehicle seat during an accident induced deceleration wherein the restraint device can be set in a retracted inactive position and wherein the restraint device can be set in an extended active position wherein the seat section has a padding which defines a seat surface and a padding support which is provided beneath the padding.

Such vehicle seats are generally known. For example a motor vehicle seat with a seat surface on the surface of a padding is known from German laid open specification DE 102 31 794 A1 wherein a seat pan is provided beneath the seat surface and wherein between the seat pan and the seat surface of the seat section a U shaped adjusting element is arranged which in the case of a crash can be moved out from an initial position in such a way that the seat surface and the adjusting element counteract a forward displacement in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle of the pelvis of a person sitting on the seat surface. With this vehicle seat the adjusting device is for example of U shaped design and is coupled by both end portions to the side regions of the vehicle seat. This has the disadvantage that for realizing an active restraint device for preventing submarining of a person sitting on the vehicle seat a so called anti submarining restraint device i.e. a restraint device which can be transferred from an inactive to an active extended position it is provided that the restraint device during assembly of the vehicle seat must be connected to structural elements of the vehicle seat such as seat side sections or a seat section frame or the like as a result of which there is no modularity in the sense of the possibility of deciding only at a late stage of the seat production or of the seat completion whether the vehicle seat is to be equipped with a restraint device or not. In the case of known vehicle seats therefore a larger number of variants of the vehicle seat have to be taken into consideration over a larger part of the production chain of the vehicle seat which altogether leads to higher cost in the case of logistics and production. A vehicle seat with a seat frame a seat cushion and a seat cushion support is known from German laid open specification DE 199 43 595 A1 wherein in the longitudinal direction an anti submarining ramp is attached approximately in the middle of the seat padding support extends to the front edge of the seat padding support and covers approximately the front half of the seat padding support. A normally folded up airbag which is inflated in the event of a crash is provided between the ramp and the seat padding support or is embedded in the ramp. However an airbag of this type is comparatively expensive and therefore the known vehicle seat is overall comparatively costly.

The present invention is therefore based on the object of providing a vehicle seat with a restraint device for preventing submarining of a passenger on the vehicle seat in the case of an accident induced deceleration wherein the vehicle seat for one thing can be equipped with such a restraint device easily and simply with the least possible cost and as late as possible in the production chain of the vehicle seat and wherein for another thing the restraint device is equipped in such a way that the restraint device can be connected particularly simply but nevertheless securely to the vehicle seat.

The object is achieved by means of a vehicle seat with a seat section and with a restraint device for preventing submarining of a passenger on the vehicle seat wherein the restraint device can be set in a retracted inactive position and wherein the restraint device can be set in an extended active position wherein the seat section in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle has side sections on both sides wherein the seat section has a padding which defines a seat surface and a padding support which is provided beneath the padding and wherein in addition the restraint device is arranged between the padding support and the padding and also at a distance from the seat side sections and wherein the restraint device is fastened exclusively to the padding support. As a result of this it is possible in a particularly simple manner that the modularity of the restraint device is ensured i.e. the possibility of deciding only at a late point in time in the production chain of the vehicle seat whether a specific vehicle seat is to be equipped with a restraint device according to the invention or not. According to the invention it is particularly preferred that the restraint device can be fastened to the padding support by pushing on and or by sliding on and or by clipping and or by adhesive fastening. With this means the restraint device can be fastened to the padding support in a particularly simple and rapid manner and nevertheless a secure connection can be ensured. In the sense of the present invention a padding support is understood to be a single structural component or a multiplicity of structural components of the seat section which are provided at least in the proximity of the padding which is possibly to be fastened later on the seat and which retain or support the padding. For example a padding support which continues essentially over the entire seat surface as an essentially universal cushion pan or seat pan is a possibility as a padding support in this case. Furthermore according to the invention for example a so called split seat pan or divided seat pan is a possibility in which such a split seat pan supports approximately the front half or only the front or rear approximately 20 or just 10 of the padding. Furthermore structural elements such as tubular or open stiffening elements are also a possibility as part of the padding support. In the case of a padding support in the sense of the present invention this can also partially have an underspringing.

According to the invention it is especially preferred if the restraint device has an actuating means especially a pyrotechnic linear actuator and or a reversibly operating actuator wherein the actuating means is arranged between the padding support and the padding or is supported between the padding support and the padding wherein in particular an operation of the actuating means is already provided in terms of time before the existence of an accident induced deceleration. In the case of supporting the actuating means between the padding support and the padding the actuating means can partially also extend or be arranged beneath the padding support. Linear actuators are comparatively small and can be realized in a compact manner in terms of installation space so that as a result of this the restraint device can be configured in an especially compact manner in terms of installation space and according to the invention the modularized installation method of the restraint device in the vehicle seat can be especially easily realized. According to the invention for example a pyrotechnic linear actuator also a reversibly operating actuating means for example an electric motor powered linear actuator can be provided alternatively or cumulatively to an irreversibly operating actuating means and together with corresponding sensors pre crash sensors which anticipate an accident leads to a setting of the extended active position of the restraint device or to a setting of an intermediate position of the restraint device between the inactive position and the active extended position already before an accident occurrence in terms of time and therefore before the existence in terms of time of an accident induced deceleration i.e. a deceleration which is typical for an accident occurrence .

Furthermore it is preferred if the restraint device has a positioning element which is movable by the actuating means wherein the positioning element is adjustable by means of the actuating means from a retracted position which corresponds to the inactive position of the restraint device into an extended position which corresponds to the active position of the restraint device. As a result of this it is possible that the positioning element can be optimized to the respective application case independently of the actuating means for example with regard its compressibility for example for energy dissipation during an accident situation or also with regard to its dimensions which in their turn for example have an influence on the extension degree of the restraint device.

Furthermore it is preferred that a rotation around an axis which extends essentially horizontally and especially transversely to the direction of the vehicle is provided between the retracted position and the extended position of the positioning element wherein the positioning element is preferably provided as a plate form positioning element and wherein the rotation around the essentially horizontally extending axis is preferably provided as a rotation in the direction of travel. As a result of this a plate can be used as the positioning element which extends essentially over the entire width of the restraint device which can preferably be installed in a modular manner wherein the plate in the retracted position of the positioning element is arranged essentially parallel to the seat surface or parallel to the padding support and in the extended position of the positioning element is arranged essentially perpendicularly to the seat surface or perpendicularly to the padding support. Between the positioning element and the padding of the seat section according to the invention there is preferably a cover of the restraint device in the sense of an anti submarining ramp. As a result of this it is advantageously ensured that the body of the seat s occupant in the case of an accident situation i.e. a negative acceleration or a deceleration which exceeds a prespecified limiting value exerts a force action upon the restraint device over the largest possible area so that the risk of injury of the seat s occupant is lessened. A particular advantage of a movement of the positioning element in the direction of the vehicle is that the force action of the actuating means especially a pyrotechnic linear actuator can be selected in such a way that the force action of the actuating means or its extension in any case is not directed in the direction of main body parts especially in the direction of the pelvis or in the direction of the trunk of the seat s occupant. As a result of this the risk of injury is likewise reduced.

According to the invention it is additionally preferred that a rotation at least of a part of the positioning element around an axis which extends essentially vertically is provided between the retracted position and the extended position of the positioning element wherein the positioning element is preferably provided as a telescopically extendable positioning element with one or more extendable elements. As a result of this it is advantageously possible that the positioning element can be realized in a compact type of construction for example by means of cup like components which telescopically inter engage and for realizing the extended position from the retracted position a rotational movement of at least one of the cup like components around its center is carried out. In this case a spirally designed pin and slot guide of the at least two cup like components is preferably provided according to the invention for converting the rotational movement into an extending movement. For realizing a locking of such a positioning means the pin and slot guide can be configured by means of an asymmetrical toothing in such a way that only a movement in the direction of the extending movement is possible. Alternatively to an exemplary pin and slot guide in the case of the telescopically extendable variant of the positioning element it can also be provided according to the invention that for example two cup like components inter engage like a thread and by means of a rotation of one of these components relative to the other a positioning is brought about.

Furthermore it is preferred if the restraint device has a lower section and an upper section wherein the lower section has fastening elements for connecting the restraint device to the padding support or if the padding support has fastening elements for connecting the restraint device to the padding support. As a result of this it is possible in a simple manner to create the connection between the restraint device and the padding support without expensive tools being required for it or without the task making high qualification demands. In this case according to the invention a fastening by pushing on or sliding on or clipping or adhesive fastening have proved to be especially preferable. Combinations of two or more such fastening possibilities can also be used for example for securing a push on connection or a slide on connection. Alternatively to the embodiment variant of the restraint device with a lower section and an upper section it can also be provided according to the invention that the functionality of the lower section for example the provision of connecting points of levers or the like is undertaken by the padding support full integration of the lower section into the padding support and that consequently the lower section can be saved so that the weight can be reduced and costs can be saved. For example it is provided in this case that the restraint device that is to say for example lever connections or the like of the restraint device are screwed and or riveted and or pinned to the lower section.

Furthermore it is preferred if the restraint device has a locking means wherein the locking means is preferably provided in a moveable manner by means of the movement of the positioning element wherein in particular the locking means has a slot and a bolt wherein the bolt has an axial first section with reduced diameter and an axial second section with enlarged diameter and wherein an axial movement of the bolt is provided for bringing about the locking. As a result of this it is advantageously possible according to the invention that a modular type of construction of the locking means can be provided in such a way that the blocking force of the locking means can be set largely independently of the other characteristics of the restraint device. For example it is possible according to the invention that a drag lever on its end opposite the positioning element is guided in a housing which accommodates a multiplicity of spring loaded latching bolts which in the retracted position of the positioning element press upon the drag lever. As soon as the drag lever has extended far enough in the direction of the extended position of the positioning element one of the latching bolts locks the return movement of the drag lever. By a multiplicity of such latching bolts a multiplicity of engaged positions can be defined. This is especially advantageous in case on account of malfunction of the actuating means or on account of the particular situation of a seat occupancy for example by an abnormally large or an abnormally small person as the seat occupant a movement of the positioning element into its furthermost extended position is not carried out. A further embodiment variant of the restraint device for alternative realization of a locking means according to the invention can provide a slot with a starting section and with an end section wherein a bolt which is moved together with the positioning element engages in the slot wherein the bolt in the inactive position of the restraint device is located in the starting section of the slot and in the active position of the restraint device is located in the end section of the slot and wherein the shape of the slot is configured in such a way that at least in the fully activated position or active position of the restraint device a reverse movement of the positioning element or of the bolt is prevented. In this case the slot according to a further variant of the locking means can have for example a curvature or a bend point in such a way that the bolt which is moved with the positioning element can no longer be moved back into the starting section or such a reverse movement is highly improbable on account of the force ratios which exist in an accident situation. Furthermore in a further variant an operating cam also with a starting section and an end section for a bolt can be provided instead of the slot wherein the operating cam has a recess in the end section in such a way that the bolt which is moved with the positioning element likewise can no longer be moved back into the starting section or such a reverse movement is highly improbable on account of the force ratios which exist in an accident situation. In this case it can preferably be provided that the element or component which features the operating cam is spring preloaded in the direction of the inactive position. In the case of the embodiment variants with a slot it can be advantageously provided in the same way that the element or component which features the slot is spring preloaded in the direction of the inactive position. Furthermore in a further variant a slot in a way in which it is configured in the style of a keyhole can be formed with a starting section which has a reduced clear opening and an end section which has an enlarged clear opening in such a way and interacting with a bolt that the bolt has a smaller diameter in a first axial section and interacts with the starting section and that the bolt upon reaching the end section of the slot which is to be carried out during a movement of the positioning element in the direction of the active position with a second axial section of the bolt which has a larger diameter is pressed into the end section on account of a spring pretensioning of the bolt. In a further embodiment variant of the restraint device for alternative realization of a locking means according to the invention the positioning element can interact with the upper section especially with holes or recesses in such a way that upon reaching the active position a reverse movement of the positioning element is prevented. According to the invention it is furthermore provided that partial aspects of the different variants of the restraint device with a locking means can be combined with each other. In this way for example the last mentioned variant holes or recesses in the positioning element can be combined with the other variants.

Further subjects of the present invention relate to a restraint device according to the invention for a vehicle seat and also to a method for producing a vehicle seat according to the invention wherein in a first step the supporting structure of the vehicle seat is produced and wherein in a second step the restraint device is connected to the padding support. As a result of this it is especially possible that the complete production steps for producing the structural elements of the vehicle seat for example the frame of the seat the frame of a back section the sub construction of the seat section and the like are carried out in the first production step and for example are undertaken in the factory of the seat section manufacturer. The integration of the restraint device into the vehicle seat or with the seat section of those vehicle seats which are to be equipped with the restraint device can then be undertaken in a production plant in the proximity of the final production of the vehicle seat or of the vehicle in which the vehicle seat is to be installed wherein for this installation of the restraint device in the vehicle seat according to the invention there are significantly lower equipping requirements and furthermore significantly less qualification requirements of the employees who carry out the installation than for the production of the structural elements of the vehicle seat for which for example the production of welded joints is necessary.

In in the left hand part of the figure a side view of a vehicle seat according to the invention is schematically shown. The vehicle seat comprises a seat section and also as a rule a back section which is not provided with a designation. According to the invention the seat section especially has a frame like structure with at least two seat side sections on the sides. Inside this frame like structure the seat section has a seat pan or a padding support . A padding or a seat cushion is connected to the seat pan or to the padding support . The seat section is connected to the floor sub assembly of the vehicle interior or to the body structure of the vehicle by means of a seat substructure . By means of the seat substructure it can be provided according to the invention that the complete vehicle seat is connected in a longitudinally adjustable and or vertically adjustable and or inclinably adjustable manner. For this purpose in the left hand part of the seat substructure is shown as outlined links which by rotating or pivoting can bring about a corresponding seat setting. The padding has a seat surface upon which a user of the vehicle seat or an occupant of the vehicle or a passenger can be seated. According to the invention it is provided in an especially preferred manner that the seat pan or the padding support together with the padding and the seat surface is provided in a vertically and or inclinably adjustable manner in relation to the rest of the seat section .

The seat section of the vehicle seat according to the invention for example can be provided as a two times or four times or six times or eight times or multiply adjustable substructure as a result of which for example the seat height and or the seat inclination and or the seat longitudinal adjustment and or the seat length setting thigh support length can be set. The padding support is shown in largely as a separate and one piece seat pan or as a corresponding padding support but can also be provided as a split padding support or a corresponding seat pan as can be seen with reference to the examples of embodiment variants of a padding support which are shown in and . A single structural component or a multiplicity of structural components of the seat section are especially understood as a padding support which are at least adjacent to a padding of the seat or are provided in the proximity of such a padding approximately at a maximum distance of 10 mm from such a padding and wherein such a padding is carried or supported or retained by the padding support or by its components. As a padding support in this case for example a continuous padding support cushion pan or seat pan or a split seat pan or split seat bucket are a possibility or even structural elements such as tubular or open stiffening elements as part of the padding support.

According to the invention a restraint device is arranged between the padding support and the seat surface by means of which a submarining of the user of the vehicle seat in the case of an accident induced deceleration can be avoided or reduced. The restraint device is provided as an active anti submarining device and according to the invention is especially preferably designed as a so called add on element which can be selectively integrated into the vehicle seat or not depending upon equipping wishes of the customer or the specifications of the manufacturer . Such an active anti submarining device component can offer an essential contribution to the improvement of occupant protection in the case of a head on crash. The unit can preferably be installed as an add on element in almost all front seats and also rear seats. In this case the restraint device can be especially preferably integrated into the vehicle seat in a so called JIT workshop just in time workshop i.e. in comparatively close proximity to the final assembly of the vehicle or of the complete seat module by only a fastening of the restraint device on the padding support being carried out for example via a known fastening technique such as clipping screwing or riveting. In this case it is especially advantageous that preferably no welding operations whatsoever arise and also no modifications to structural components of the seat section at all are necessary. Furthermore according to the invention it is especially advantageous that an identical seat pan or an identical padding support can be used both for a vehicle seat with the restraint device and for a vehicle seat without the restraint device . As a result of this the production costs for such vehicle seats can be significantly reduced or the logistical additional expense for a flexible use of the restraint device on any such vehicle seats is greatly reduced.

In the right hand part of a perspective view of a seat pan or of a padding support of a seat section of a vehicle seat according to the invention is schematically shown with a partially sectioned view of a restraint device according to the invention.

For the positioning of the upper shell of the restraint device this comprises a positioning element which in is shown only as a lever which is driven by the actuating means . In this embodiment of the restraint device the positioning element during the movement between the inactive position of the restraint device and the active position of the restraint device is rotated or pivoted around an essentially horizontal rotational axis extending parallel to the seat surface . As a result of this the positioning element is adjusted from a retracted position which corresponds to the inactive position of the restraint device into an extended position which corresponds to the active position of the restraint device so that the upper shell is extended and as a result of this according to the invention a relatively large impact surface for the pelvic region of a user in an accident situation is provided. An alternative embodiment of the positioning element is an essentially plate form configuration of the positioning element . A positioning element which extends in an essentially flat manner corresponds to an essentially plate form configuration of the positioning element wherein such an element for example is at least twice as long as a rule oriented approximately in the Y direction as it is wide as a rule oriented approximately in the X direction in its inactive position and has a depth of at most a third of its width. Alternatively to such an essentially plate form element as a positioning element it can also be provided according to the invention that a tube with a plate welded on or another structural element of the restraint device serves as a positioning element .

The positioning element according to the invention in the exemplary embodiment according to is rotatably or pivotably connected to the lower shell or connected directly to the padding support . This last mentioned alternative connection of the positioning element is especially advantageous when the lower shell is not present. The connection of the positioning element to the lower shell and or to the padding support can especially be provided by means of one or by means of two or by means of three bearing points or even by means of more than three bearing points. Two bearing points are advantageously provided on the lateral ends of the positioning element in the Y direction .

According to the invention the positioning element and or the upper section can preferably have a plurality of material zones for bringing about a deformation behavior or an energy dissipation behavior. In this connection different material zones in particular have a different deformation behavior. Alternatively or cumulatively the positioning element and or the upper section is provided to be at least partially reversibly deformable wherein the positioning element preferably has a shock absorber or a gas pressure damper or a plurality of such elements. As a result a different deformation behavior can be realized for accident situations of differing severity or for different forces to be transmitted between the user of the vehicle seat and the vehicle seat.

Alternatively to a positioning element which is rotatable around an essentially horizontal rotational axis it is also possible according to the invention and schematically shown in based on an alternative embodiment of the positioning element that the positioning element is rotatable around an essentially vertical rotational axis essentially perpendicularly vertical on the seat surface or is rotatable at least in parts. In this case the positioning element for example has two reciprocating pistons which are especially cup like in design and have a spiral pin and slot guide and also are rotatable relative to one another and during a rotation execute an axial extending movement along for example the common center axis. Alternatively to a rotation around a common center axis an eccentric rotation of the one reciprocating piston relative to the reciprocating piston or relative to another reciprocating piston can be also be provided. As a result of this the installation space which is required for the restraint device and also the weight can be reduced. Locking of the positioning element in the extended position can be realized via a preferably asymmetrical toothing as locking means between the two parts which are rotatably arranged in relation to each other. Furthermore alternatively or cumulatively to the locking of the positioning element in the extended position an energy dissipation behavior of a positioning element which is provided in this way can be brought about relatively simply by arranging in the central region of the reciprocating pistons which are designed like cups either a shock absorber element or a gas pressure damper or a deformation material such as a metal foam a honeycomb structure or a similar material which dissipates energy in the case of a deformation. In the case of the third embodiment of the positioning element two or more reciprocating piston units can also be provided.

Alternative embodiment variants of the restraint device are shown in and and also in and in side view or in perspective view as the case may be.

In a variant of the restraint device with a variable connection of the upper section is shown in side view. The variable connection of the upper section of the restraint device is realized in the region facing away from the positioning element by means of a lever which in the initial position inactive position of the restraint device is adjusted or pivoted towards the positioning element . During an activation of the restraint device both the lever and the positioning element are rotated in the opposite rotational direction wherein the upper section is raised or positioned both in the region of the positioning element front and in the region of the padding support which faces away from the positioning element as a result of which a particularly good restraining action is achieved. When activating the restraint device a pin of the positioning element is also moved in the X direction inside an elongated hole . Such an elongated hole can be designed with latching recesses which together with the pin form an example for a locking means . In one variant of the restraint device which is not shown the upper section as in is variably connected by means of the lever but the lever in the inactive position is adjusted in a manner in which it is rotated in the direction away from the positioning element and in the region of the positioning element there is no elongated hole but a simply pivotable bearing of the upper section so that the lever the upper section and the positioning element form a four bar linkage. As a result of this an optimization of the installation space can be effected. The four bar linkage kinematics or corresponding kinematics with variable connection of the upper section corresponding to compared with the embodiment which is shown in has the advantage that the upper shell of the housing of the restraint device is also raised in the rear region. This can contribute to an improved restraining functionality. Such four bar linkage kinematics or corresponding kinematics with variable connection of the upper section corresponding to according to the invention can be arranged both parallel to the direction of travel and transversely to it or even diagonally to it.

In inactive position and active position a further variant of the restraint device with the upper section which in the case of this variant is linearly movable essentially in only outlined linear guides and which during its linear or at least essentially linear movement positions the positioning element is shown in perspective view. In this case the upper section is driven by the actuating means which for example is provided as a helical spring or another form of actuating means is provided for example a pyrotechnically operating linear actuator.

The actuating means can preferably be designed according to the invention as a pyrotechnic unit or as a pyrotechnic actuator preferably a linear actuator. According to the invention however it is alternatively or cumulatively also possible that the actuating means is designed as a spring preloaded element with mechanically stored actuating energy or is designed as an electromagnetic unit. In this case it is especially advantageously provided according to the invention that the effective direction of the actuating means despite the relatively close arrangement of the actuating means in relation to the user of the vehicle seat at no time is directed towards the user or to sensitive body parts of the user such as the torso or the pelvic region . As a result of this the risk of injury for example in the case of a material defect can be significantly reduced. The effective direction of the actuating means can be provided according to the invention either essentially parallel to the direction of the vehicle or else be established transversely to it or even be established diagonally to it.

According to the invention a locking means not illustrated can be fastened to the positioning element in particular to the upper end thereof. Such a locking means is preferably provided according to the invention to ensure a good protection function of the restraint device such that during an actuation of the actuating means the system is immediately locked against a movement back into the inactive position by means of the locking means. As a result of this a maximum possible protection action in all conceivable situations is achieved even when the actual fully extended end position of the restraint device is not reached.

According to the present invention the restraint device is arranged between the padding support and the padding and also at a distance from the seat side sections and the restraint device is fastened exclusively to the padding support . As a result of this it is advantageously possible that the restraint device can be fitted to the padding support particularly rapidly and simply.

In and two further variants of the restraint device in the active position and or in the inactive position and are shown in perspective view. In this case a slot is arranged in a locking lever which is arranged at the side. The slot has a starting section and an end section . A bolt which is movable with the positioning element engages in the slot and during a movement into the active position of the restraint device is moved along the slot from the starting section in the direction towards to the end section . The shape of the slot is now configured in such a way that a reverse movement of the positioning element or of the bolt at least in the fully activated position or active position of the restraint device is prevented. The difference between the embodiment variant which is shown in and and the embodiment variant which is shown in and is based essentially in the shape of the slot wherein the embodiment variant according to and has a more bent shape of the slot while the embodiment variant according to and has a more curved shape of the slot . The locking lever in this case can be pretensioned or spring preloaded in the direction of its position which corresponds to the inactive position.

According to a further embodiment variant of the locking means which is shown in inactive position and active position instead of the slot according to the previously described embodiment variant an operating cam also with a starting section and an end section for the bolt is provided wherein the operating cam has a recess in the end section in such a way that the bolt which is moved with the positioning element can also no longer be moved back into the starting section or such a reverse movement is highly improbable on account of the force ratios which exist in an accident situation. The locking lever in this case can also be pretensioned or spring preloaded in the direction of its position which corresponds to the inactive position.

According to a further embodiment variant of the locking means which is shown in inactive position and active position the slot is formed with a starting section which has a reduced clear opening and an end section which has an enlarged clear opening in such a way that the bolt has a smaller diameter in a first axial section and interacts with the starting section and that the bolt upon reaching the end section of the slot which is to be carried out during a movement of the positioning element in the direction of the active position is pressed with a second axial section of the bolt which has a larger diameter into the end section on account of an axial spring pretensioning of the bolt due to a spring element .

According to a further embodiment variant of the locking means which is shown in active position and inactive position it is provided that the positioning element interacts with the upper section especially with holes or recesses in the upper section in such a way that upon reaching the active position a reverse movement of the positioning element is prevented. In this case it is especially provided that the positioning element has locking lugs for engaging in the recesses of the upper section. Furthermore it can be additionally provided that the upper section has a stop for limiting the positioning movement of the positioning element for example an adapted flange.

In the embodiment of the connection of the restraint device according to the restraint device is fastened to the padding support by means of displacement relative thereto. For this purpose a fastening element comprising for example an elongated hole in the form of a keyhole and a guide pin is provided wherein the guide pin is introduced into the elongated hole and is subsequently displaced by a certain distance corresponding to the arrow in order to fasten together the elements which are to be connected. In the case illustrated in the lower side for example of the lower section of the restraint device is provided with a number of pins which are inserted into corresponding recesses elongated holes in the padding support and after a displacement according to the arrow produce a connection between the padding support and the restraint device . Alternatively it can also be provided that the pins are formed on the padding support and the elongated holes are formed on the restraint device . Furthermore it can alternatively also be provided that a clip connection is used for the fastening.

As an alternative it may also be provided according to the invention that different connecting techniques are combined with one another for example the embodiment variants according to or and according to . By this means it is possible to bring about a particularly good and secure connection between the padding support and the restraint device .

According to the invention further suitable connecting techniques also include welding in particular laser welding. Furthermore according to the invention cold metal transfer welding CMT welding or else screwing is also suitable.

In the embodiment of the locking means which is schematically shown in an asymmetrical toothing is provided between the two telescopically inter engaging cylinder elements which together form the positioning element . In this case the asymmetrical toothing is designed in such a way that an extending movement of the cylinder elements is possible but no reverse movement. According to a variant of this embodiment of the locking means which is not shown it is provided that a pin slot guide or pin guide track which is spirally arranged in the region of the circumference of the cylinder elements in its end section which corresponds to the active position extended cylinder elements has a reduced pitch which in the event of a release of the restraint device leads to the prevention of the movement into the inactive position of the restraint device.
