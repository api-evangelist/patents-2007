title: Fast state transition for a UE with reconfiguration over paging
abstract: Techniques to support fast state transition by a user equipment (UE) are described. The UE may operate in a first state (e.g., a CELL_PCH state) in which the UE does not transmit or receive user data. The UE may receive a paging message carrying first configuration information. The UE may transition from the first state to a second state (e.g., a CELL_DCH state) in response to receiving the paging message. The UE may determine a set of communication parameters based on the first configuration information received from the paging message and second configuration information stored at the UE. The UE may then exchange user data based on the set of communication parameters. The UE may use default values for some parameters in order to reduce the amount of first configuration information to send in the paging message.

The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional U.S. Application Ser. No. 60 870 580 entitled RECONFIGURATION OVER PAGING FOR HSPA filed Dec. 18 2006 assigned to the assignee hereof and expressly incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates generally to communication and more specifically to techniques for transitioning between operating states by a user equipment UE in a wireless communication network.

A UE e.g. a cellular phone in a wireless communication network may operate in one of several operating states at any given moment. In an active state the UE may be allocated resources by the wireless network and may actively exchange data with the wireless network e.g. for a voice and or data call. In an idle state the UE may not be allocated resources by the wireless network and may monitor a paging channel for paging messages. The active and idle states may be referred to by different names in different systems. The UE may transition between the active and idle states based on data requirements of the UE. For example the UE may transition to the active state whenever there is data to send or receive and may transition to the idle state after completing the data exchange with the wireless network.

The UE may exchange signaling with the wireless network in order to transition between operating states. The signaling may allocate resources to the UE and may configure various parameters to be used by the UE for communication with the wireless network. The signaling consumes network resources and delays data transmission. There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to efficiently transition between operating states by the UE.

Techniques to support fast state transition for a UE by sending configuration information over paging are described herein. The UE may operate in a first state e.g. a CELL PCH state in which the UE does not send or receive user data. The UE may monitor for paging messages while in the first state and may receive a paging message carrying first configuration information. The UE may transition from the first state to a second state e.g. a CELL DCH state in response to receiving the paging message. The UE may determine a set of communication parameters based on the first configuration information received from the paging message and second configuration information stored at the UE. The UE may then exchange user data based on the set of communication parameters while in the second state. This may avoid the need to exchange signaling after receiving the paging message in order to obtain the first and or second configuration information.

In one design the first configuration information may include or indicate a set of physical channel parameters to use for communication. The set of physical channel parameters may include at least one Radio Network Temporary Identifier RNTI for the UE at least one channelization code and or at least one time offset for at least one physical channel at least one signature sequence a scrambling code and or some other physical channel parameters. The UE may exchange user data based on the set of physical channel parameters provided by the first configuration information.

In one design the second configuration information may include or indicate a set of physical channel parameters a set of transport channel parameters a set of radio bearer parameters a set of radio access bearer parameters a set of security parameters or any combination thereof. The UE may store the second configuration information when transitioning to the first state. The UE may also use default values for some communication parameters in order to reduce the amount of first configuration information to send in the paging message.

The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication networks such as Code Division Multiple Access CDMA networks Time Division Multiple Access TDMA networks Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA networks Orthogonal FDMA OFDMA networks etc. The terms network and system are often used interchangeably. A CDMA network may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access UTRA cdma2000 etc. UTRA includes Wideband CDMA W CDMA and other variants of CDMA. cdma2000 covers IS 2000 IS 95 and IS 856 standards. A TDMA network may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications GSM . An OFDMA network may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA E UTRA Ultra Mobile Broadband UMB IEEE 802.16 IEEE 802.20 Flash OFDM etc. UTRA E UTRA and GSM are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS and are described in documents from an organization named 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP . cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 . 3GPP and 3GPP2 documents are publicly available. These various radio technologies and standards are known in the art. For clarity certain aspects of the techniques are described below for UMTS and UMTS terminology is used in much of the description below.

Each RNC may couple to a set of Node Bs via an Iub interface and may provide coordination and control for these Node Bs. For example an RNC may perform radio resource management some mobility management functions and other functions to support communication between the UEs and the UTRAN. Each RNC may also couple to one or more other RNCs via an Iur interface and to core network via an Iu interface. Core network may include various network entities that may support circuit switched CS packet switched PS and other services for the UEs.

Network may support communication for any number of UEs. For simplicity only one UE is shown in . A UE may also be referred to as a mobile station an access terminal a subscriber unit a station etc. A UE may be a cellular phone a personal digital assistant PDA a wireless device a wireless modem a handheld device a laptop computer etc. UE may communicate with Node B via a radio link and with SRNC via a Uu interface. SRNC may serve UE and may terminate both the Iu link for data exchanges and the corresponding signaling between UE and core network . SRNC may also terminate Radio Resource Control RRC signaling between UE and UTRAN and may perform management functions such as outer loop power control load control admission control handover control mobility management etc. UE may communicate directly with SRNC not shown in or indirectly via CRNC DRNC as shown in . CRNC DRNC may control Node B with which UE communicates and may perform functions such as macrodiversity combining and splitting routing of data between UE and SRNC etc.

In UMTS data is processed as one or more transport channels at Layer L . The transport channels may carry data for one or more services e.g. voice video packet data etc. The transport channels include a Dedicated Channel DCH an Enhanced Dedicated Channel E DCH a High Speed Downlink Shared Channel HS DSCH a Broadcast Channel BCH a Forward Access Channel FACH a Paging Channel PCH and a Random Access Channel RACH . The transport channels are mapped to physical channels at a physical layer PHY or Layer L . The physical channels are channelized with different channelization codes and are orthogonal to one another in the code domain. The transport channels and physical channels are described in 3GPP TS 25.211 entitled Physical channels and mapping of transport channels onto physical channels May 2007.

The UE may communicate with the UTRAN via radio bearers RBs which are services provided by Layer for transfer of user data between the UE and the UTRAN. The radio bearers may be established reconfigured and released through RRC radio bearer procedures. The radio bearers may be configured with various parameters and may utilize transport channels and physical channels. The transport and physical channels may be configured with the radio bearer procedures and may also be configured separately with transport and physical channel procedures.

The UE may perform an Establish RRC Connection procedure in order to transition from the Idle mode to the Connected mode. From this procedure the UE may obtain the following 

The parameters above may be referred to as communication parameters. The physical channel parameters may also be referred to as PHY parameters L parameters etc. The transport channel parameters may also be referred to as Medium Access Control MAC parameters L parameters etc. The radio bearer parameters may also be referred to as upper layer parameters etc. The Establish RRC Connection procedure and the various communication parameters given above are described in 3GPP TS 25.331 entitled Radio Resource Control RRC Protocol Specification September 2007.

In the Connected mode the UE may be in one of four RRC states a CELL DCH state a CELL FACH state a CELL PCH state and a URA PCH state . The CELL DCH state is characterized by i dedicated physical channels allocated to the UE for the downlink and uplink and ii a combination of dedicated and shared transport channels available to the UE. The CELL FACH state is characterized by i no dedicated physical channels allocated to the UE ii a default common or shared transport channel assigned to the UE for use to access the UTRAN and iii the UE continually monitoring the FACH for signaling such as reconfiguration messages. The CELL PCH and URA PCH states are characterized by i no dedicated physical channels allocated to the UE 2 the UE periodically monitoring the PCH for paging messages and iii the UE not being permitted to transmit on the uplink. The location of the UE is known at the cell level in the CELL PCH state and is known at a User Registration Area URA level in the URA PCH state. A URA may include a set of cells. The UE may be paged via a specific cell in the CELL PCH state and via all cells in a specific URA in the URA PCH state. The RRC modes and states are described in the aforementioned 3GPP TS 25.331.

The UE may transition i from the Idle mode to the CELL DCH or CELL FACH state by performing an Establish RRC Connection procedure and ii from the CELL DCH or CELL FACH state to the Idle mode by performing a Release RRC Connection procedure. While in the Connected mode the UTRAN can command the UE to be in one of the four RRC states based on activity of the UE. The UE may transition i between the CELL DCH and CELL FACH states by performing a reconfiguration procedure and ii between different configurations in the CELL DCH state by also performing a reconfiguration procedure. The UE may transition from the CELL DCH state to the CELL PCH or URA PCH state by performing a reconfiguration procedure. The UE may also transition from the CELL FACH state to the CELL PCH or URA PCH state by performing a reconfiguration procedure. The UE may autonomously transition from the CELL PCH or URA PCH state to the CELL FACH state upon receiving a paging message. These various procedures are described in the aforementioned 3GPP TS 25.331.

The UE and the SRNC may exchange RRC messages via the Uu interface. The SRNC and the CRNC DRNC may exchange Radio Network Subsystem Application Part RNSAP messages via the Iur interface. The CRNC DRNC and the Node B may exchange Node B Application Part NBAP messages via the Iub interface. The Uu interface and RRC messages and procedures are described in the aforementioned 3GPP TS 25.331. The Iur interface and RNSAP messages and procedures are described in 3GPP TS 25.423 entitled UTRAN Iur interface RNSAP signaling September 2007. The Iub interface and NBAP messages and procedures are described in 3GPP TS 25.433 entitled UTRAN Iub interface Node B Application Part NBAP signaling September 2007.

The SRNC may then send a CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message to the Node B which may forward the message on the FACH to the UE step . This message may include reconfiguration parameters that may be used for any radio bearer reconfiguration procedure. The Node B may send a RADIO LINK RESTORE INDICATION message to the CRNC DRNC which may in turn send a RADIO LINK RESTORE INDICATION message to the SRNC step .

The UE may transition from the CELL FACH state to the CELL DCH state upon receiving the CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message step . The UE may perform uplink synchronization and may send a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message on the E DCH to the Node B which may forward the message to the SRNC step . The UE may thereafter exchange e.g. transmit and or receive user data via the established radio link.

In message flow the UE first transitions from the CELL PCH state to the CELL FACH state and then transitions from the CELL FACH state to the CELL DCH state. In the CELL FACH state messages are sent on the RACH by the UE and on the FACH to the UE. The RACH and FACH are common transport channels that are shared by different UEs. It is desirable to reduce state transition delays when the UE is in the Connected mode. This may improve radio resource utilization and extend battery life for the UE especially for applications characterized by intermittent data exchanges and tight latency requirements such as Web browsing Push to Talk etc.

In an aspect fast state transition from the CELL PCH state to the CELL DCH state may be achieved by incorporating reconfiguration function in a paging message. The may allow the UE to transition directly from the CELL PCH state to the CELL DCH state after receiving the paging message. The fast state transition may reduce overhead as well as latency.

The SRNC may then send a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message within a paging message to the UE step . The PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message may include various physical channel parameters as described below. The Node B may send a RADIO LINK RESTORE INDICATION message to the CRNC DRNC which may in turn send a RADIO LINK RESTORE INDICATION message to the SRNC step .

The UE may transition from the CELL PCH state directly to the CELL DCH state upon receiving the PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message step . The UE may perform uplink synchronization and then send a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message on the E DCH to the Node B which may forward the message to the SRNC step . The UE may thereafter exchange user data via the established radio link.

In the design shown in fast state transition is achieved by performing reconfiguration over paging. In general any set of parameters may be reconfigured over paging. In one design only a set of physical channel parameters is reconfigured over paging which may reduce overhead in sending the parameters. In this design the UE may store the radio bearer parameters and the transport channel parameters upon transitioning to the CELL PCH state. Establishment reconfiguration of these stored parameters may then be avoided. To further reduce overhead only certain UE specific physical channel parameters may be sent over paging and default values may be used for remaining physical channel parameters. In general all or a subset of the physical channel parameters may be explicitly sent to the UE via paging.

The techniques described herein may be used for any mapping of the PCH to physical channel. For example the PCH may be sent on a Secondary Common Control Physical Channel S CCPCH which is broadcast to all UEs. The PCH may also be sent on a High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel HS PDSCH which may be sent to specific UEs.

The techniques described herein may also be used to send configuration information for any set of physical channels. For clarity configuration information is sent for physical channels used for High Speed Downlink Packet Access HSDPA and High Speed Uplink Packet Access HSUPA which are collectively referred to as High Speed Packet Access HSPA . HSDPA and HSUPA are sets of channels and procedures that enable high speed packet data transmission on the downlink and uplink respectively. Table 1 lists some physical channels in UMTS including some used for HSDPA and HSUPA. These physical channels are described in the aforementioned 3GPP TS 25.211.

For HSDPA the UE may be configured for either HS SCCH operation or HS SCCH less operation. For HS SCCH operation signaling is sent on the HS SCCH prior to packet transmission on the HS PDSCH. The UE may monitor up to four 128 chip channelization codes for the HS SCCH to detect for signaling. The UE may process up to fifteen 16 chip channelization codes for the HS PDSCH to receive data. For HS SCCH less operation signaling is not sent on the HS SCCH and the UE may process the HS PDSCH based on preconfigured parameters. A default HSDPA configuration may be used for the UE. This default configuration may includes L channelization codes for the HS SCCH and M channelization codes for the HS PDSCH where 1 L 4 and 1 M 15.

Various physical channel parameters may be sent in a paging message to support physical channel reconfiguration over paging. In one design the paging message may carry one or more of the physical channel parameters given in Table 2.

The HS SCCH code information may be for a default HSDPA configuration with fewer than four HS SCCH codes and one HS PDSCH code. This may reduce the number of bits to send for the HS SCCH code information.

Table 2 gives an example set of physical channel parameters that may be sent in a paging message. Other physical channel parameters may also be sent in a paging message. The physical channel parameters may be sent as information elements IEs in a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message which may be carried in a paging message. A different IE may be used for each physical channel parameter.

In general the physical channel parameters for the UE may be provided by one or more network entities. The SRNC may obtain all of the physical channel parameters for the UE from the appropriate network entities and may then send these parameters in a paging message to the UE.

The H RNTI may be assigned to the UE by the CRNC DRNC. The CRNC DRNC may send the H RNTI to the Node B via a RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message and to the SRNC via a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message.

The primary E RNTI may be assigned to the UE by the Node B and reported to the CRNC DRNC via a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPOSSE message. The CRNC DRNC may forward the primary E RNTI to the SRNC via a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message.

The C RNTI may be assigned to the UE by the CRNC DRNC via a cell update procedure which may be performed whenever the UE changes cell due to mobility. The CRNC DRNC may report the C RNTI to the SRNC via an UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message whenever the cell update procedure is performed.

The HS SCCH code information for the UE may be provided by the Node B. The CRNC DRNC may configure the Node B with a set of HS SCCH codes to be used for HS DSCH operation and may send this HS SCCH code set via a PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message. The Node B may assign up to four HS SCCH codes to the UE when for HS SCCH operation. Node B may report the assigned HS SCCH code s to the CRNC DRNC via a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message. The CRNC DRNC may forward this information to the SRNC via a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message.

The F DPCH information for the UE may be provided by the SRNC and the CRNC DRNC. The SRNC may configure the F DPCH offset and power settings in the Node B and may send these parameters to the CRNC DRNC via a RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message. The CRNC DRNC may allocate the channelization code for the F DPCH and configure the Node B with the F DPCH settings e.g. the frame offset channelization code and transmit power for the UE. The CRNC DRNC may report the F DPCH code to the SRNC via a RADIO LINK RESPONSE message.

The E HICH information for the UE may be provided by the Node B. The Node B may assign the E HICH code and signature sequence to the UE and may report these parameters to the DRNC CRNC via a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message. The CRNC DRNC may forward this information to the SRNC via a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message.

The grant information for the UE may be provided by the Node B. The Node B may assign the E AGCH code and the E RGCH signature sequence to the UE and may report these parameters to the CRNC DRNC via a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message. The CRNC DRNC may forward the information to the SRNC via a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message.

The UTRAN may desire to page the UE and may first determine pertinent physical channel parameters for the UE. The SRNC may configure the F DPCH offset and send it in a RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message to the CRNC DRNC step . The CRNC DRNC may assign the H RNTI to the UE and send the H RNTI and the F DPCH offset to the Node B via a RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message step . The Node B may assign the primary E RNTI the HS SCCH code s the F DPCH code the E HICH code and signature sequence and the E AGCH code and E RGCH signature sequence for scheduled configuration to the UE. The Node B may then send these parameters in a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message to the CRNC DRNC step . The CRNC DRNC may then send the H RNTI assigned by the CRNC DRNC as well as the primary E RNTI the HS SCCH code s the F DPCH code the E HICH code and signature sequence and the E AGCH code and E RGCH signature sequence assigned by the Node B in a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE message to the SRNC step . The SRNC may then send all of the physical channel parameters in a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message which may be carried in a paging message sent to the UE step .

In the design described above and shown in the physical channel parameters for the UE are assigned partly by the SRNC partly by the CRNC DRNC and partly by the Node B. Therefore the SRNC may first set up Iub Iur bearers and collect these physical channel parameters for the UE. shows a specific design for collecting physical channel parameters for the UE using specific messages in UMTS. The physical channel parameters may also be collected in other manners e.g. from different network entities using different messages etc.

As noted above only a small set of physical channel parameters may be sent to the UE in a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message over a paging message. Default values may be used for remaining physical channel parameters in order to reduce overhead. The default values may be defined in various manners.

In one design the UE may store certain physical channel parameters used previously by the UE in the CELL DCH state. For example an uplink scrambling code may be assigned to the UE when the UE enters the CELL DCH state. Instead of discarding this uplink scrambling code when leaving the CELL DCH state as is normally done the UE may store this uplink scrambling code upon transitioning to the CELL PCH state. Thereafter when performing fast state transition from the CELL PCH state to the CELL DCH state the UE may reuse the stored uplink scrambling code. By retaining and reusing the uplink scrambling code signaling of a new uplink scrambling code may be avoided. In general the UE may store any physical channel parameters for later use by the UE.

In another design one or more predefined configurations may be available. Each predefined configuration may be associated with specific values for a set of physical channel parameters. The available predefined configurations may be provided to the UE i via system information that may be broadcast to all UEs ii via dedicated signaling sent to the UE and or iii via some other means. The paging message may then include a pointer or an index for one of the predefined configurations. The same set of predefined configurations may be used by all Node Bs or by a group of Node Bs e.g. in a URA . Alternatively each Node B may be associated with a set of predefined configurations applicable for only that Node B.

The default values may also be provided in other manners. The default values may also be provided based on a combination of the designs described above. For example certain physical channel parameters e.g. those assigned by the CRNC DRNC and or SRNC may be associated with default values used previously by the UE in the CELL DCH state and other physical channel parameters e.g. those assigned by the Node B may be provided via predefined configurations.

The techniques described herein may be used for fast state transition from the CELL PCH state to the CELL DCH state. In the CELL PCH state the location of the UE is known at the cell level. The SRNC may set up Iub Iur bearers for only the Node B for the cell in which the UE is currently registered e.g. as described above for .

The techniques may also be used for fast state transition from the URA PCH state to the CELL DCH state. In the URA PCH state the location of the UE is known at the URA level. To page the UE the SRNC may set up Iub Iur bearers for all Node Bs in the URA in which the UE is currently registered. To support fast state transition one or more predefined configurations applicable for all Node Bs in the URA may be defined. One predefined configuration may then be used for the UE for fast URA PCH to CELL DCH state transition. The RNC may pre book or reserve resources at the Node Bs for HSPA for a certain number of UEs while keeping alive the corresponding Iub Iur bearers. The RNC may use one of the pre booked resources to perform fast reconfiguration for the UE.

As noted above various physical channel parameters may be sent to the UE for fast state transition. Table 3 lists some physical channel parameters that may be sent in a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message. The Category column indicates whether a parameter is specific to a cell or common to a URA. The Sent in Page column identifies physical channel parameters that may be sent in a paging message in accordance with one design. This design assumes that i a UTRAN single UE identity U RNTI is used in paging type 1 part ii only HSPA configuration is used and therefore only the F DPCH is configured for the downlink iii only the HSPA serving radio link is established iv no frequency re direction is performed v the reconfiguration procedure is performed with an activation time of now and vi ciphering and integrity protection are not applied to the paging message. Integrity protection and ciphering may be applied e.g. by using a message authentication code to let the UE know that the paging message is intended for the UE. This may avoid the need to send the 32 bit U RNTI in the paging message.

Table 4 lists some parameters that may be sent for the uplink DPCH information. The last column indices whether a given parameter may be sent in a paging message or whether a default value may be used for the parameter.

Table 7 lists some parameters that may be sent for downlink information common for all radio links RL .

Table 8 lists some parameters that may be sent for downlink F DPCH information common for all radio links.

The UE may determine a set of communication parameters based on the first configuration information received from the paging message and second configuration information stored at the UE block . The first configuration information may include a set of physical channel parameters. Alternatively the first configuration information may include an identifier or index of a predefined configuration associated with the set of physical channel parameters. In this case the UE may obtain the set of physical channel parameters from system information received from a cell or via some other means. In any case the set of physical channel parameters obtained from the first configuration information may include at least one RNTI for the UE at least one channelization code for at least one physical channel at least one time offset for at least one physical channel at least one signature sequence a scrambling code some other physical channel parameters or a combination thereof. The UE may also obtain a set of physical channel parameters a set of transport channel parameters a set of radio bearer parameters a set of radio access bearer parameters a set of security parameters or any combination thereof from the second configuration information stored at the UE. The UE may exchange user data based on the set of communication parameters block .

The UE may store the second configuration information when transitioning to the first state. The UE may also use default values for some parameters in order to reduce the amount of first configuration information to send in the paging message.

For UMTS the UE may receive the paging message on the PCH which may be sent via the S CCPCH or HS PDSCH. The UE may receive from the paging message a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message carrying the first configuration information.

For block the SRNC may obtain a set of physical channel parameters for the UE from the Node B and or may obtain at least one physical channel parameter for the UE from the CRNC DRNC. The SRNC may then provide the set of physical channel parameters from the Node B and or the at least one physical channel parameter from the CRNC DRNC in the first configuration information sent to the UE. The UE may exchange user data based on the set of physical channel parameters from the Node B and or the at least one physical channel parameter from the CRNC DRNC.

A controller processor may direct the operation of various units at UE . Controller processor may perform process in and or other processes for the techniques described herein. A memory may store program codes and data for UE .

Node B includes a transmitter receiver a processor controller a memory Mem and a communication Comm unit . Transmitter receiver may support radio communication with UE and other UEs.
