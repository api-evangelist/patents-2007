The present invention relates to a trigger type pump dispenser which is free from vertical movement of a nozzle part and facilitates pointing at a target upon jetting.

More particularly the present invention relates to a trigger type pump dispenser which jets liquid in a cylinder from the nozzle part to outside by vertically sliding a piston member wherein the trigger type pump dispenser is capable of precisely hitting a position serving as a target by the liquid in the state in which there is completely no vertical movement of the nozzle part and has a simple structure.

Conventionally a trigger type pump dispenser has been used as a means which jets liquid such as a chemical solution to a predetermined part.

The pump dispenser has advantages that a piston is moved merely by operating a trigger so as to readily jet liquid which is in a container connected to a cylinder from a nozzle and is widely used.

In such a trigger type pump dispenser having a trigger generally the direction is set toward the position that is a target of jetting by holding a dispenser main body and an operation of pulling a trigger structure in other words turning operation is carried out.

Consequently the piston part is lowered the liquid in the cylinder is compressed and as a result the liquid is jetted to outside from the nozzle through a channel in the piston.

In this case since the piston part and the nozzle are coupled with each other as a matter of course the nozzle is integrally lowered at the same time as lowering of the piston.

Therefore such moving motion of the nozzle occurs during jetting and a jet track becomes a continuous linear track.

In this manner the structure in which the nozzle part is vertically moved has drawbacks that the nozzle cannot set a target on the location serving as a jetting target and that the jetted liquid cannot reach a right location.

In order to solve such problems a trigger type pump dispenser having a structure in which a nozzle part does not vertically move has been developed Patent Document 1 .

However this trigger type pump dispenser does not directly transmit the movement of the trigger to the piston.

More specifically since the trigger transmits the movement thereof to the piston via a swing lever the structure around the trigger becomes complex and transmission efficiency of power is bad from the viewpoint of friction force.

In addition since the number of parts is large assembling man hours are increased and failure readily occurs.

In order to solve such problems the present inventor has developed an innovative trigger type pump dispenser having a structure in which the vertical movement of a piston is not directly transmitted to a nozzle part.

In this trigger type pump dispenser a piston structure comprises a nozzle part a piston part and a coupling part coupling both of them wherein the coupling part is bendable.

As a result since the nozzle part is not vertically moved at all liquid can be caused to reach a target position precisely.

However when the coupling part is bent upon jetting a channel in the coupling part specifically the cross sectional shape thereof is deformed and narrowed.

Meanwhile a piston structure in which a nozzle part a coupling part and a piston part are integrated is generally manufactured by injection molding.

In that case the part between the nozzle part and the piston part i.e. the coupling part is molded in an L shape bent state therefore molds for the molding become inevitably large.

When a plurality of piston structures as many as possible are to be molded by molds having a certain size bending the coupling part into the L shape has to be avoided.

The present invention has been accomplished based on such background techniques and accomplished to overcome the above described technical problems.

Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a pump dispenser capable of preventing deformation of a channel of a coupling part when a piston is pushed down by a trigger even when the trigger type pump dispenser has a structure in which a coupling part is bent and a nozzle is not vertically moved.

Furthermore it is also an object to provide a plurality of piston structures which can be produced as many as possible by molds having a certain size.

Thus the present inventor carried out diligent studies about such problem background and as a result found out that deformation of the cross section of the coupling part can be prevented by forming fins on the coupling part of the piston structure and that when the coupling part can be bent by 90 degrees or more piston structures as many as possible can be produced by molds and the present invention has been accomplished based on this finding.

The present invention resides in 1 a trigger type pump dispenser for jetting liquid which is in a cylinder part from a nozzle part to outside by vertically sliding a piston part in a cylinder by turning a trigger the trigger type pump dispenser having a base main body having the cylinder part inside and attachable to an opening part of a container main body a cover body detachably latched with the base main body a piston structure composed of the nozzle part engaged with the base main body the piston part and a bendable coupling part coupling the nozzle part and the piston part and the trigger turnably attached to the base main body for vertically sliding the piston part in the cylinder wherein many fins are formed on the periphery of the coupling part so that an interior channel cross section is not deformed.

The present invention also resides in 2 the trigger type pump dispenser according to above described 1 wherein the coupling part of the piston structure can be bent by an angle of 90 degrees or more.

The present invention also resides in 3 the trigger type pump dispenser according to above described 1 wherein a rod like closing valve for blocking the pressure in the container by sealing an channel which is in the piston part at a top dead point of the piston part is provided in the cylinder part.

The present invention also resides in 4 the trigger type pump dispenser according to above described 3 wherein the rod like closing valve is integrally formed with a first valve upon manufacturing and upon use separated from each other and subjected to use.

The present invention also resides in 5 the trigger type pump dispenser according to above described 1 wherein an eave part for covering the latched part of the base main body and the cover body is provided on the cover body.

The present invention also resides in 6 the trigger type pump dispenser according to above described 1 wherein a cap part and an introducing tube are integrated with the base main body.

The present invention also resides in 7 the trigger type pump dispenser according to above described 1 wherein an end of the trigger is pivotally attached to the base main body by a first pivotally attached part an intermediate position of the trigger is pivotally attached to the piston part by a second pivotally attached part.

The present invention also resides in 8 the trigger type pump dispenser according to above described 7 wherein the ratio of the distance between the first pivotally attached part and the second pivotally attached part and the distance from the position of the first pivotally attached part to a distal end of the trigger is 1 4.5 or more.

Note that a configuration in which above 1 to 8 are arbitrarily combined can be also employed as long as the objects of the present invention are satisfied.

In the trigger type pump dispenser of the present invention the coupling part of the piston structure can be bent and the many fins are formed on the periphery thereof so that the interior channel is not deformed therefore the jetted liquid can efficiently and smoothly pass through the channel.

Moreover the coupling part has the bendable structure that absorbs the vertical movement of the piston therefore extra parts are not required the structure is simple and less failure is caused.

Moreover the coupling part of the piston structure can be bent by an angle of 90 degrees or more therefore the piston structure can be inject molded in a linear state and then can be bent and assembled.

As a result the piston structures as many as possible can be formed from the molds having a certain size.

Moreover the rod like closing valve which blocks the pressure in the container by sealing the channel in the piston part at the top dead point of the piston part is provided in the cylinder part therefore leakage from the nozzle part does not occur even when the pressure in the container main body is increased for some reasons and the liquid back flows in the cylinder part.

Moreover the rod like closing valve is integrally formed with the first valve upon manufacturing and upon use separated and subjected to use therefore the number of parts is reduced.

Moreover the eave part for covering the latched part of the base main body and the cover part is provided on the cover part therefore appearance is not deteriorated since the latched part is not seen from outside.

Moreover the base main body is integrated with the cap part and the introducing tube therefore the number of parts is reduced as well.

Moreover the end of the trigger is pivotally attached to the base main body by the first pivotally attached part the intermediate position of the trigger is pivotally attached to the piston member by the second pivotally attached part and the ratio of the distance between the first pivotally attached part and the second pivotally attached part and the distance from the position of the first pivotally attached part to the trigger distal end of the trigger is 1 4.5 or more therefore the trigger can be readily pulled In other words the trigger can be lightly actuated .

The trigger type pump dispenser slides a piston part downward and jets liquid in a cylinder from a nozzle part when the trigger is pulled in other words turned as shown in .

In the trigger type pump dispenser of the present invention at this point the position of the nozzle part is not changed at all and is not vertically moved.

The trigger type pump dispenser has a base main body which first directly attached to a container a cover body which is attached to the base main body the trigger which is attached to the base main body and a piston structure which is vertically moved by the trigger and an interior channel formed by them has a first valve FV and a second valve SV.

For example as the materials a cap and the base main body uses a polypropylene resin PP the trigger uses a polyoxymethylene resin POM the piston structure uses a linear low density polyethylene resin LLDPE a silicone resin etc.

More specifically the base main body integrally has the cap and the cap is detachable from the opening part of the container X by engagement or screwing.

In this case base main body is fixed to the opening part of the container X by screwing the cap A therewith and holding a lower end part of the base main body .

The base main body has a hollow cylindrical cylinder part which is capable of housing the piston part in the inside thereof and an expanded part which is enlarged above the cylinder part .

Below the cylinder part which is a part of the base main body a two step tubular part A having a diameter smaller than that is formed and the first valve FV spring equipped valve is provided in a lower part small diameter part A of the tubular part A.

Note that the liquid in the container is sucked up into the cylinder part through the first valve FV.

An introducing tube B which sucks up the liquid at the bottom of the container and introduces it to the first valve FV is integrally formed below the tubular part A.

A rod like closing valve is disposed in an upper part large diameter part A of the tubular part A and a tip of the closing valve is inserted into the interior of a small diameter part A of the piston part .

When the piston part is at a top dead point position before pulling the trigger a bulged part at the tip of the closing valve is in pressure contact with the inner wall of the small diameter part A of the piston part and the channel of the liquid is closed.

Therefore even when the liquid is elevated and back flowed through the first valve FV when the inner pressure of the container X is increased in this state there is an effect that the liquid does not escape toward the nozzle part .

Herein the closing valve is integrally formed with the first valve FV for example by injection molding as shown in and upon use they are separated from each other and subjected to use.

A base part of the closing valve is divided into radial divided pieces and the divided pieces are press fitted on the inner wall of an upper part of the tubular part A large diameter part A .

The first valve FV also abuts a valve seat of a lower part of the tubular part A small diameter part A .

Meanwhile the lid like cover body is removably latched above the expanded part of the base main body .

An eave part for covering the latched part is formed on the cover body at the part latched with the base main body .

Since there is the eave part the latched part is covered and cannot be readily seen from outside and the appearance is good.

When the cover body is removed from the base main body the trigger the piston structure the cylinder part etc. are exposed therefore there is an advantage that the interior can be readily cleaned.

When the pump dispenser is held the base of the thumb abuts a rear part of the expanded part and the part functions to support the weight thereof.

In an upper part of the cylinder part of the above described base main body the two step hollow cylindrical piston part having the small diameter part A is slidably provided and the piston part serves as a part of the piston structure as described below.

The piston structure is formed of an elastically deformable resin such as linear low density polyethylene LLDPE or a silicone resin and integrally has the nozzle part at the front the piston part at the rear and a coupling part coupling the nozzle part and the piston part to each other.

Many fins A are formed on the surface of the coupling part and even when the material of the piston structure including the coupling part is a soft for example silicone resin the interior channel of the coupling part is not squashed by deforming.

At the point when the piston structure is formed by molds generally injection molding the piston part the coupling part and the nozzle part thereof are linear in whole.

At this moment the piston part is attached to the cylinder part and the piston structure is in the state that it is linearly projected.

From this state the coupling part is bent in an L shape and the cover body is pushed down so as to latch the nozzle part.

At this point the nozzle part is fixed so as to be sandwiched by the base main body and the cover body in the front and as a result movement of the nozzle part caused along with movement of the piston part is restricted.

In this manner the linearly formed piston structure is bent nearly by 90 degrees at the part of the coupling part and assembled.

More specifically when distal ends of the base main body and the cover body are engaged with a circumferential groove A in the periphery of the nozzle part the nozzle part is fixed so as to be sandwiched by both of them.

Even when the piston part is vertically moved in the state in which the nozzle part is fixed as is described later in detail the coupling part functions to actively absorb the vertical movement of the piston part by bending deformation of the coupling part since the coupling part can be bent and deformed in an elastically compressed manner.

Note that the second valve SV spring equipped valve is provided in the nozzle part and the liquid in the container is finally discharged to outside through the second valve SV.

Meanwhile the trigger which moves up down the piston structure has a two diverged part which is extended from a finger rest part and a spring part wherein the two diverged part is attached to the base main body and the piston part and the spring part is retained by and fixed to the base main body .

Specifically in the trigger an end and an intermediate position of the two diverged part are pivotally attached to the base main body and the piston part respectively.

In detail at distal ends of the two diverged part of the trigger circular holes B are formed and the circular holes B are fitted with circular projections A formed on upright wall parts A of the base main body thereby forming a first pivotally attached part P.

A pair of circular projections A is formed on an outside wall of the small diameter part A of the piston part and the two diverged part of the trigger is disposed so as to sandwich the small diameter part A.

The circular projections A are fitted in circular holes A formed at intermediate positions of the two diverged part thereby forming a second pivotally attached part P.

Herein the ratio i.e. lever ratio of a distance L between the first pivotally attached part P and the second pivotally attached part P and a distance L from the position of the first pivotally attached part P to the distal end of the trigger is preferably 1 4.5 or more.

Note that as described above in the conventional trigger type pump dispenser in which a nozzle N is fixed Patent Document 1 since the structure thereof transmits movement of the trigger to the piston via the swing lever achieving such lever ratio has been difficult because of the structure thereof.

The lever ratio of 1 4.5 or more can be achieved since the part between the second pivotally attached part and the first pivotally attached part P can be caused to be linear and shortened by placing the second pivotally attached part P on the side surfaces of the piston part like the present invention.

Note that the reason why the lever ratio herein uses the position of the distal end of the trigger as a reference is that there is a tendency that holding positions of the forefinger and the middle finger are naturally determined when the length of the trigger is set.

When the finger rest part of the trigger is held and turned wherein the first pivotally attached part P serves as a starting point the distance between both of them is shortened and the spring part of the trigger exerts bouncing force in the opposite direction.

More specifically a distal end of the spring part of the trigger is fitted in a fixing part of the base main body so as to be retained and fixed and when the finger rest part is held and pulled the angle formed by the finger rest part and the spring part is reduced and the bouncing force works. When the holding fingers are released the trigger returns to the original position.

Meanwhile an upper first sealing valve B for sealing the interior of the cylinder part and a second sealing valve B which is below the first sealing valve B are formed in the piston part .

As is described below outside air P and the interior of the container main body can be mutually switched between a communicated state and a non communicated state via a ventilation hole S by the functions of the first sealing valve B and the second sealing valve B of the piston part .

On the wall of the cylinder part the ventilation hole S is provided and a ventilation channel for introducing the outside air P into the container main body as shown by an arrow is formed.

When the first sealing valve B of the piston part is slid and in pressure contact with respect to the cylinder part the ventilation channel is closed or opened.

Meanwhile in the state before the liquid in the container main body is jetted the vertical position of the ventilation hole S of the cylinder part is between the first sealing valve B and the second sealing valve B of the piston part .

More specifically the second sealing valve B is formed for preventing the liquid that is sucked up by the introducing tube B and then entered the interior of the cylinder part from leaking and the first sealing valve B is formed for preventing the outside air P from being communicated via the ventilation hole S.

When the trigger is pulled in this state the liquid in the cylinder part is jetted from the nozzle part .

In this case the piston part is pushed down by the trigger and the first sealing valve B in the upper side is moved to the side below the ventilation hole S while sliding the inner wall of the cylinder part .

The outside air P enters inside the cylinder part and enters the container main body via the ventilation hole S and a negative pressure is released.

When the pressing toward the finger rest part of the trigger is released in this state in order to return to the original state the piston part is lifted up by the returning force of the spring part and the liquid in the container main body is lifted up via the introducing tube B and fills the inside space in the cylinder part as a matter of course also the interior of the piston part .

Finally the first sealing valve B is moved to the upper side of the ventilation hole S the flow of the outside air P is blocked and it returns to the original state.

Herein working of the piston structure will be described in detail in order to show the function of the coupling part which is an important part of the present invention.

At this moment the finger rest part of the trigger is pulled in order to jet the liquid to a predetermined location. The trigger turns based on the first pivotally attached part P.

The trigger is pivotally attached to the piston part second pivotally attached part P by the two diverged part therefore the piston part is downwardly pushed down by the turning of the trigger .

The liquid in the cylinder part is compressed by the downward movement of the piston part reaches the nozzle part through the coupling part and is jetted to outside from a jet opening N.

In this process due to the push down of the piston part the nozzle part which is integrated with it is also to be pulled down however as descried above the nozzle part is not lowered since the nozzle part is fixed between the base body and the cover body .

However herein the coupling part is bent and deformed and actively absorbs the vertical movement of the piston.

In this manner even though the nozzle part is fixed the trigger type pump dispenser of the present invention can vertically move the piston part by the working of the coupling part .

Upon jetting of the liquid the liquid can be precisely jetted to a position serving as a target in the state in which there is completely no vertical movement of the jet opening N.

Since the many fins A are formed in the periphery of the coupling part the channel cross section thereof is not deformed at all even when it is bent.

A device part for preventing the nozzle part from being affected by the movement of the piston part is not additionally required like conventional cases therefore the structure as the trigger type pump dispenser is simplified.

The present invention has been explained above however the present invention is not limited to merely the above described embodiment and it goes without saying that various modifications can be made without departing from the essence thereof.

For example attachment of the distal end of the spring part of the trigger to the base main body can employ an arbitrary means such as fitting inserting or supporting.

From the viewpoint of bending and deformation property the piston structure uses the silicone resin the LLPDE resin however another elastomer resin excellent in the elastic compression bending property can be used merely at the coupling part.

The present invention relates to a trigger type pump dispenser which jets liquid in a cylinder from a nozzle part to outside by vertically sliding a piston member wherein the trigger type pump dispenser is capable of precisely hitting a position serving as a target by liquid in the state in which there is no vertical movement of a nozzle part at all and has a simple structure however the present invention can be applied to other fluid jetting field as long as the principles thereof are utilized and the application field thereof is wide.
