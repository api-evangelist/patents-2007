This present application is a continuation in part of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 466 238 entitled Systems And Methods For Providing Dynamic Connection Spillover Among Virtual Servers and filed Aug. 22 2006 which is incorporated herein by reference.

This application related to computer networking technologies and more specifically to providing dynamic virtual server spillover management based on bandwidth.

Network appliances are often used to provide access to one or more network services. A network appliance may comprise a number of virtual servers each virtual server providing access to a number of services. The virtual servers may manage incoming connections from clients and direct client requests to one or more services. In the course of managing incoming connection requests network appliances may provide load balancing among the virtual servers. When a virtual server is down or unavailable to service a connection request the appliance may use a backup virtual server to manage incoming connections.

A virtual server may be operational or available but not operating at a desired performance level. A network appliance may direct a client request or connection to a virtual server operating less than an optimal performance level. For example a network appliance may direct a client request to a virtual server that is slow. In another example the network appliance may direct a client request to a virtual server that is servicing a high amount of responses or network traffic. The virtual server may be using significant network capacity transferring requests and responses between clients and serviced. In some cases the response time of the virtual server may decrease if it handles additional client connections because of the limited availability of bandwidth. In other cases the round trip times between the server and the virtual server or between the client and server may decrease due to the limited availability of bandwidth.

It would therefore be desirable to provide systems and methods to dynamically spillover between virtual servers providing access to one or more services based on a bandwidth.

The present solution provides a spillover management technique for virtual servers of an appliance based on bandwidth. A network administrator may configure a bandwidth threshold for one or more virtual servers such as virtual servers providing acceleration or load balancing for one or more services. The bandwidth threshold may be specified as a number of bytes transferred via the virtual server. The bandwidth threshold may also be specified as a round trip time or derivative thereof. A user may specify the bandwidth threshold via a configuration interface. Otherwise the appliance may establish the bandwidth threshold. The appliance monitors the bandwidth used by a first virtual server. In response to detecting the bandwidth reaching or exceeding the bandwidth threshold the appliance dynamically directs client requests to a second virtual server.

Upon the virtual server falling within the bandwidth threshold the appliance directs client requests to the first virtual server. In some cases the appliance maintains connection or session persistent for a client to the second virtual server even though the first virtual server may be available. The appliance may monitor a second bandwidth threshold for the second virtual server. If the second bandwidth threshold is reached or exceeded the appliance may direct client requests to a third virtual server or back to the first virtual server. In some cases the appliance dynamically adjusts the bandwidth threshold based on performance or operational conditions of the appliance virtual server server or network connection. With the bandwidth spillover management technique the appliance manages virtual servers to perform at a level in accordance with configurable and desired bandwidth usage.

In another of these embodiments the monitoring agent verifies that the response from the network service included expected content such as the domain name of a computing device associated with the known network address and did not contain errors.

A monitoring agent may be assigned a weight by a network appliance . A weight may comprise an integer decimal or any other numeric indicator. In some embodiments a user may configure the weight corresponding to a given monitoring agent . In some embodiments all monitoring agents may be assigned equal weight. In other embodiments a plurality of monitoring agents may each be assigned different weights. The weights may be assigned to the monitors based on any criteria indicating relative importance including without limitation importance of the monitored service reliability of the monitoring mechanism and the frequency of monitoring.

In one embodiment a monitoring agent may be assigned a weight based on the relative importance of the service the appliance monitors. For example if most user requests in a given environment were HTTP requests a monitoring agent monitoring HTTP availability of a server might be assigned a weight of 10 while a monitoring agent monitoring FTP availability of a server might be assigned a weight of 3. Or for example if an administrator placed a high priority on UDP applications a monitoring agent monitoring UDP availability of a server may be assigned a weight of 20 while a DNS monitoring agent may be assigned a weight of 5.

In some embodiments an appliance may compute a sum of the weights of the monitoring agents currently reporting a network service as operational. For example if five monitoring agents each assigned a weight of 30 are monitoring a network service and three of the five monitoring agents report the network service as available the appliance may determine the sum of the monitoring agents currently reporting the network service as operational to be 90. Or for example if only two monitoring agents one with a weight of 20 and the other with a weight of 40 are reporting a server as available the appliance may compute the sum of the monitoring agents currently reporting a server as operational to be 60.

In one embodiment the first appliance may determine a sum of weights of services currently available for access via a local area network connected to the second appliance. For example if an appliance determines three services are available each having a weight of 40 the appliance may determine the sum of weights of services currently available for access to be 120. These weights may be assigned or configured according to any method described herein.

In one embodiment the first appliance may determine a number of available services providing a given network service. For example the first appliance may determine the number of currently available HTTP services. Or for example the first appliance may determine the number of currently available FTP services. In another embodiment the first appliance may determine a number of available services providing a given application. For example the first appliance may determine a number of available electronic mail services or a number of available services for streaming a word processing application.

After determining by a first appliance a first number of services currently available for access via a local area network connected to the first appliance step the first appliance may receive from a second appliance a communication indicating a second number of services currently available for access via a local area network connected to the second appliance step . This communication may be received via any protocol. In some embodiments the first appliance may receive from a plurality of appliances a plurality of communications wherein each communication indicates a number of services currently available for access via a local area network connected to one of the plurality of appliances.

In another embodiment the first appliance may receive from a plurality of appliances a plurality of communications wherein each communication indicates a number comprising a sum of weights of services currently available for access via a local area network connected to one of the plurality of appliances.

After receiving by the first appliance from a second appliance a communication indicating a second number of services currently available for access via a local area network connected to the second appliance step the first appliance may receive a plurality of requests to connect to a service step . The first appliance may receive the requests from one or more clients servers or other appliances. In some cases the plurality of requests may all be received within a given time period. The requests may comprise any connection request including without limitation a TCP connection request an SSL connection request an HTTP connection request and an FTP connection request.

After receiving a plurality of requests to connect to a service step the first appliance may determine a weight to be assigned to the second appliance wherein the determination is responsive to the second number step . In some embodiments the appliance may determine weights at given intervals. In other embodiments the appliance may determine weights in response to events. In some embodiments the appliance may determine weights prior to receiving any requests for a service.

In some embodiments the determined weight may be a ratio of the number of services available via the second appliance to the number of service available via the first appliance. For example a first appliance may determine that 10 of the services connected to the first appliance are available. A second appliance may report that 5 of the services in the branch office the second appliance provides access to are available. The total number of other available services may thus be 10. In this example the first appliance may determine to assign the second appliance a weight of 5 while assigning itself a weight of 10. Or in this example the first appliance may determine to assign the second appliance a weight of 10 while assigning itself a weight of 20. As another example a first appliance may determine that 250 is the sum of the weights of the available services connected to the first appliance. A second appliance may report that 500 is the sum of the weights of the available services connected to the second appliance. In this example the first appliance may determine to assign the second appliance a weight of 2 while assigning itself a weight of 1. Or in this example the first appliance may determine to assign the second appliance a weight of 20 while assigning itself a weight of 10.

In another embodiment the first appliance may assign a weight to the second appliance wherein the weight is determined in response to the ratio of the second number to a sum of the first number and at least one number received from a third appliance. For example a first appliance may determine that 10 of the services connected to the first appliance are available. A second appliance may report that 5 of the services in the branch office the second appliance provides access to are available. A third appliance may report that 15 of the services in the branch office the second appliance provides access to are available. The sum of other available services may thus be 25. In this example the first appliance may determine to assign the second appliance a weight of 1 while assigning itself a weight of 2 and assigning the third appliance a weight of 3. Or in this example the first appliance may determine to assign the second appliance a weight of 10 while assigning itself a weight of 20 and assigning the third appliance a weight of 30. As another example a first appliance may determine that 300 is the sum of the weights of the available services connected to the second appliance. A second appliance may report that 500 is the sum of the weights of the available services connected to the second appliance. A third appliance may report that 100 is the sum of the weights of the available services connected to the third appliance. In this example the first appliance may determine to assign the second appliance a weight of 5 while assigning itself a weight of 3 and assigning the third appliance a weight of 1. Or in this example the first appliance may determine to assign the second appliance a weight of 30 while assigning itself a weight of 20 and assigning the third appliance a weight of 10.

In other embodiments the weight assigned to the second appliance may be determined in response to numbers of available servers received from 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 16 20 30 32 64 100 or any other number of other appliances. In other embodiments the weight assigned to the second appliance may be determined in response to sums of weights of available servers received from 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 16 20 30 32 64 100 or any other number of other appliances.

After assigning a weight to the second appliance step the first appliance may forward to the second appliance a subset of the plurality of requests wherein the number of requests comprising the subset is determined in response to the determined weight step . The requests may be forwarded according to any of the protocols described herein.

In one embodiment the first appliance may forward a number of requests to the second appliance proportionate to the assigned weights of the first and second appliances. For example if the first appliance has a weight of 10 and the second appliance has a weight of 20 the first appliance may forward of incoming requests to the second appliance. Or for example if the first appliance has a weight of 10 the second appliance has a weight of 20 and a third appliance has a weight of 10 the first appliance may forward of the incoming requests to the second appliance. In this example the first appliance may then forward of the incoming requests to the third appliance and service of the requests itself.

The subset of requests forwarded to the second appliance may be determined using any weighted load balancing method. In one embodiment the first appliance may use a weighted round robin method. In another embodiment the first appliance may always forward incoming requests to the appliance with the highest weight. In some embodiments the appliance may forward incoming requests as they are received. In another embodiment the appliance may buffer incoming requests and then forward multiple requests simultaneously.

Referring now to a flow diagram of a method for determining service availability using a plurality of weighted monitoring agents is shown. In brief overview the method comprises establishing by an appliance a plurality of agents the plurality of agents monitoring a service executing on a server and each agent having an assigned weight step computing by the appliance a sum of the assigned weights of the agents reporting the service as currently operational step determining by the appliance the sum falls below a given threshold step and transmitting by the appliance an indication that the service is unusable step .

Still referring to now in greater detail an appliance establishes a plurality of agents the plurality of agents monitoring a service executing on a server and each agent having an assigned weight step The monitoring agents may comprise any monitoring agent described herein and may be assigned a weight according to any of the methods described herein. In one embodiment the appliance may establish the plurality of monitoring agents upon boot up of the appliance. In another embodiment the appliance may establish the plurality of monitoring agents upon startup of the server.

After establishing the monitoring agents step the appliance may compute a sum of the assigned weights of the agents reporting the service as currently operational step . In some embodiments the appliance may determine whether an agent is reporting the service as operational based on a response time the agent reports for the server. For example an appliance may be configured to treat as non operational any service with a response time greater than 3 seconds. Or for example an appliance may treat as non operational any response time from an HTTP monitoring agent greater than 2 seconds while treating as non operation any response time from a UDP monitoring agent greater than 0.5 seconds. In another embodiment the appliance may use a rolling average of an agent s reported response time for the server to determine whether the server is available.

In some embodiments the appliance may compute the sum of the assigned weights of the agents reporting the service as currently operational at predefined regular intervals. For example the appliance may compute the sum once every 0.1 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 or 10 seconds. In other embodiments the appliance may compute the sum of the assigned weights of the agents reporting the service as currently operational in response to an event such as a client request or a communication from another appliance.

After computing a sum of the assigned weights of the agents reporting the service as currently operational step the appliance may determine the sum falls below a given threshold step . The threshold may be any number. In some embodiments the threshold may be configured by an administrator. In some embodiments the threshold may be set such that the threshold represents a given fraction of the total weights of the monitoring agents. For example if there are four monitoring agents each with a weight of 10 the threshold may be set to 20 such that if the sum of the assigned weights of the agents reporting the service as currently operational falls below the threshold it indicates more than half of the agents report the service as unavailable.

After determining the sum falls below a given threshold step the appliance may transmit an indication that the service is unusable step . In some embodiments the appliance may transmit the indication to a client. In another embodiment the appliance may transmit the indication to a second appliance. In some embodiments the appliance may transmit the indication to a second appliance in the course of reporting a number of available services. In some embodiments a recipient of the transmission may use the transmission for load balancing methods such as those described in conjunction with .

Referring now to an embodiment of a system for providing management of transport layer connections via an appliance using a dynamic maximum connection threshold is depicted. In brief overview the appliance establishes a first vServer A to load balance a plurality of clients access to one or more services A N of a first set of servers A N. The appliance includes a connection management mechanism for managing and balancing transport layer connection requests from clients to one or more set of services A N. The appliance establishes for the first vServer A a maximum dynamic connection threshold A based on the sum of the connection capacity A N each of the services A N are targeted or configured to handle. Via monitoring agents A N the appliance monitors the operational status of each of the services A N. If any of the services A N have a change in status from available to not available or not available to available the appliance adjusts the dynamic maximum connection threshold A by including or not including the corresponding connection capacity A B of the service in the summation of the threshold. For example if the appliance detects a first service A has a status of not available the appliance subtracts the connection capacity A of the first service A from the maximum dynamic connection threshold A. As such the appliance dynamically adjusts the maximum connection threshold for a vServer in real time in accordance with the monitored status of the services A N and each service s corresponding connection capacity A N.

In further detail the connection management mechanism comprises software hardware or any combination of software and hardware having logic functions or operations for receiving and managing connection requests and communications from one or more clients A N. In one embodiment the connection management mechanism receives or intercepts transport layer connection requests and communications between the clients A N and one or more services A N. The connection management mechanism may include an application program service process task thread or any type and form of executable instructions. In another embodiment the connection management mechanism identifies determines or selects a vServer for processing a received communication from a client .

In some embodiments the connection management mechanism determines if the dynamic maximum connection threshold has been reached or exceeded. The connection management mechanism determines if the dynamic maximum connection threshold is exceeded and whether or not to establish a backup or second vServer N e.g. a spillover vServer. Upon detecting the number of active transport layer connections of the first vServer A exceeds the dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold the connection management mechanism may direct transfer or otherwise provide a received transport layer connection request of a client to the second vServer N for handling. By using the dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold the connection management mechanism dynamically and automatically spillovers connection requests from clients from a first vServer A to a backup or second vServer N.

In other embodiments the connection management mechanism may maintain connection or session persistence between a client and the vServer A N handling requests for the client . In some embodiments the connection management mechanism selects the spillover vServer N for handling a client request even though the number of active connections of the first vServer A does not exceed the maximum connection threshold . In other embodiments the connection management mechanism selects the first vServer A for handling a client request event though requests from other clients are directed to the spillover vServer N. In one embodiment the connection management mechanism may select the first vServer A or second vServer N based on which vServer most recently handled a request from the client .

Upon detecting the dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold has been exceeded for the first vServer A and or the second vServer N the connection management mechanism in one embodiment may determine not to establish another spillover vServer N but instead redirects the client directly to a server or otherwise to bypass the appliance . For example the connection management mechanism may determine the dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold B for the spillover vServer N has been reached and may redirect the client to bypass the appliance instead of establishing a third vServer N for spillover. In these embodiments the connection management mechanism may transmit a redirect Uniform Resource Locator URL to the client for the client to connect to in response to the client s connection request. The URL may identify any one of the servers or services .

In yet another embodiment the appliance and or connection management mechanism manages the number of active connections and performs dynamic spillover techniques for a plurality of vServers A N. In one embodiment the second vServer B may be managing connections from a plurality of clients A N to a second set of services A N . In some embodiments the appliance monitors a second dynamic maximum connection threshold B for a second vServer B. In one embodiment the second vServer B may be acting as a spillover vServer for the first vServer N or a third vServer.

The connection capacity for a service comprises a predetermined number of clients transport layer connections or users a service is designed configured or intended to handle or process. In some embodiments the connection capacity comprises a maximum number of clients connections or users a service is configured targeted or intended to handle or process. In one embodiment a user such as the administrator of the appliance configures the connection capacity for the service . In another embodiment the appliance determines the connection capacity from the service or server providing the service . For example the appliance may transmit a request to the server or service for its connection capacity and in response the server transmits to the appliance a predetermined number of active connections it may handle.

Each of the connection capacities A N may comprise any combination of a same or different connection capacity as another capacity. In one embodiment the connection capacity A for a first server A is different than the connection capacity B of a second server B. In some embodiments the connection capacity A for a first service A is the same as the connection capacity B for a second service B. In another embodiment the connection capacity A of a service A may be set to a value below the service s actual connection capacity. In other embodiments the connection capacity A of a service A may be set to a value above the service s actual connection capacity. In some embodiments the connection capacities may represent a connection based weighting of each of the services A N in a first set or second set of a plurality of services.

The dynamic maximum connection threshold A N generally comprises a predetermined number identifying a maximum number of active transport layer connections the vServer is configured designed or otherwise intended to process handle or have active. In one embodiment a user such as an administrator of the appliance configures the dynamic maximum connection threshold . In another embodiment the appliance sets the dynamic maximum connection threshold to a default value of the sum of the configured connection capacity for each of the services A N managed by the vServer .

The appliance may adjust the dynamic maximum connection threshold in response to events corresponding to a vServer and to one or more services . The appliance may monitor the services using one or more monitoring agents . In one embodiment the appliance may adjust the dynamic maximum connection threshold in response to a monitoring agent reporting a service as unavailable. If a service with a given connection capacity is reported as unavailable the appliance may subtract the service s connection capacity from the dynamic maximum connection threshold of the vServer providing access to that service . Further if the service previously reported as unavailable is then reported as available the appliance may then add back the connection capacity for that service to the dynamic maximum connection threshold .

The monitoring agents may monitor any aspect of a service and may use any technique to determine whether a given service is available. In one embodiment a monitor may measure the response time of a service and report the service as unavailable if the response time exceeds a given threshold. In another embodiment a monitor may measure the response time of a service and report the service as unavailable if the response time exceeds a determined average response time for the service . In still another embodiment a monitor may measure the response time of a service and report the service as unavailable if the response time exceeds a given deviation from a determined average response time for the service.

Although the technique of dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold is generally discussed in view of transport layer connections and connection requests the appliance may perform this technique for any type and form of transport layer protocol or application layer protocol carried via the transport layer. In one embodiment the appliance may perform dynamic connection spillover among vServers A N using a dynamically adjusted maximum connection threshold for Secure Socket Layer SSL or Transport Layer Security TLS connections and connection requests.

Referring now to steps of an embodiment of a method for practicing a technique of dynamical spillover management is depicted. In brief overview the method comprises establishing on an appliance a first virtual server which directs transport layer connection requests from a plurality of clients to a first plurality of services step establishing via the appliance a predetermined threshold identifying a maximum active transport layer connection capacity for the first virtual server the predetermined threshold comprising a sum of a predetermined connection capacity for each of the plurality of services step monitoring by the appliance a status for each of the plurality of services step and adjusting by the appliance the predetermined threshold to comprise the sum of the predetermined connection capacity for each of the plurality of services having a status of available step . The appliance may then receive a transport layer connection request step determine that a number of active connections to the first virtual server exceeds the predetermined threshold step . The appliance may then determine to provide the request to a second virtual server step .

Still referring to now in greater detail an appliance establishes a first virtual server which directs transport layer connection requests from a plurality of clients to a first plurality of services step . This virtual server may comprise any virtual server capable of providing access to one or more services . In one embodiment the virtual server may comprise a vServer . In one embodiment the appliance may establish the virtual server upon startup of the appliance. In another embodiment the appliance may establish the virtual server in response to a previously established virtual server exceeding maximum connection threshold. In one embodiment the appliance may establish a plurality of virtual servers.

In the embodiment shown the appliance may then establish a dynamic maximum connection threshold for the first virtual server step . In some embodiments the threshold comprises a sum of a predetermined connection capacity for each of the plurality of services. In one embodiment the threshold may be initially configured by a user or administrator of the appliance. In another embodiment the threshold may be initially determined by the appliance by polling one or more services .

In the embodiment shown the appliance may then monitor a status for each of the plurality of services step . The appliance may monitor a status for each of the services using any means. In one embodiment the appliance may use a monitoring agent . In another embodiment the appliance may use a plurality of monitoring agents . In one embodiment the appliance may monitor the status for each of the services at predetermined time intervals for example once every 0.01 0.1 0.2 0.5 or 1 seconds. In another embodiment the appliance may monitor the status for each of the services asynchronously.

In the embodiment shown the appliance may then adjust the predetermined threshold to comprise the sum of the predetermined connection capacity for each of the plurality of services having a status of available step . For example if a service with a given connection capacity is reported as unavailable the appliance may subtract the service s connection capacity from the dynamic maximum connection threshold of the vServer providing access to that service . Further if a service previously reported as unavailable is then reported as available the appliance may then add back the connection capacity for that service to the dynamic maximum connection threshold .

In the embodiment shown the appliance may then receive a transport layer connection request step . The transport layer request may comprise any request to connect to a service . The transport layer request may be received from any computing device including a client server or a second appliance . In one embodiment the request may identify a type of service . For example the transport layer request may comprise a request for HTTP service. Or for example the transport layer request may comprise a request for UDP service.

In the embodiment shown the appliance may then determine whether the dynamic maximum connection threshold of the first virtual server has been exceeded. The appliance may compare the current connection load for the first virtual server with the current value of the dynamic maximum connection threshold for the first virtual server. In one embodiment the first virtual server may comprise a primary or default virtual server. In another embodiment the first virtual server may comprise a primary or default virtual server for a particular type of service. If the dynamic maximum connection threshold of the first virtual server has not been exceeded the appliance may provide the connection request to the first virtual server step .

If the dynamic maximum connection threshold of the first virtual server has been exceeded the appliance may establish in response to the threshold being exceeded a second virtual server step . In other embodiments a second virtual server may already have been established prior to some or any of the steps shown. The second virtual server may provide access to a second plurality of services . In one embodiment one or more of the second plurality of services may comprise the same type of service as one or more of the first plurality of services. The appliance may then establish and subsequently adjust a dynamic maximum connection threshold corresponding to the second virtual server. The appliance may then provide the connection request to the second virtual server step .

In other embodiments a second virtual server may already have been established prior to some or any of the steps shown. The second virtual server may provide access to a second plurality of services . In one embodiment one or more of the second plurality of services may comprise the same type of service as one or more of the first plurality of services. The appliance may then provide the connection request to the second virtual server step . The appliance may then establish and subsequently adjust a dynamic maximum connection threshold corresponding to the second virtual server.

In still other embodiments if the dynamic maximum connection threshold of the first virtual server has been exceeded the appliance may in response to the threshold being exceeded redirect the client making the request to another resource. In one embodiment the appliance may transmit a URL to the client comprising the address of a server or service such that the client may bypass the appliance and access the server or service directly. In one embodiment the appliance may transmit a URL to the client comprising the address of a second appliance . In still another embodiment the appliance may redirect the client request to a second appliance based on a dynamically determined connection capacity for the second appliance as discussed in conjunction with .

The appliance may then determine whether the client making the connection request has a previously existing connection with either the first or a second virtual server step . In some embodiments an appliance may assign a priority to providing connection requests from a client to virtual servers that have previously serviced or are currently servicing connections from the client. For example if a connection request is received from a client and the client has a currently existing connection with a first virtual server the appliance may provide the connection request to the first virtual server even if the first virtual server is above its dynamic maximum connection threshold. Or for example if a client has a previous connection via a backup virtual server and the primary virtual server subsequently becomes available again the appliance may still provide a subsequent connection request from the client to the backup virtual server. In one embodiment a connection management mechanism or other appliance component may track previously established or current connections so that incoming connection requests from a client can be provided to a virtual server having previously serviced connections from the client.

Referring now to systems and methods for dynamically managing connection spillover from a first virtual server to a second virtual server based on bandwidth are depicted. The appliance may establish or a user configure a bandwidth threshold for one or more virtual servers managing one or more services. The appliance monitors the bandwidth used by a virtual server. In response to detecting the bandwidth reaching or exceeding the bandwidth threshold the appliance dynamically directs client requests to another virtual server. The bandwidth threshold may be adjusted to take into account bandwidth capacity response times virtual server performance or performance of the server. The appliance manages virtual servers based on the bandwidth usage to maintain performance of the virtual servers and the services managed by the virtual servers at a desired level or within a predetermined performance range.

Referring now to an embodiment of an appliance for providing dynamic virtual server spillover management based on bandwidth is depicted. In brief overview the appliance establishes a first vServer A to manage access by a plurality of clients to one or more services A N of a first set of servers A N.

The monitoring agents may include a bandwidth detector for measuring the bandwidth used by a virtual server . The bandwidth detector may at predetermined frequencies or time frames determine a measured bandwidth A for a first vServer A. The bandwidth detector may also determine a measured bandwidth B for the second vServer N.

If the measured bandwidth for the first vServer A is determined to have reached or exceeded the bandwidth threshold A the connection manager of the appliance may determine to direct client requests to the second vServer N.

Although a measurement of bandwidth using the above equation is described other derivatives of this request using any combination of factors maximum transmission unit MTU round trip times and packet loss may be used.

The bandwidth threshold for a vServer may be specified as a number such as a real or integer. In one embodiment the bandwidth threshold may be expressed in units of number of bytes per a unit of time. In some embodiments the bandwidth threshold may be specified as a percentage. For example the bandwidth threshold may represent a percentage of bandwidth used by the vServer . In another example the bandwidth threshold may represent a percentage of bandwidth available to the vServer .

In some embodiments the bandwidth threshold may indicate a direction for measuring the bandwidth of a vServer . In one embodiment the bandwidth threshold identified the measurement is bi directional. For example the bandwidth threshold may indicate to measure bandwidth of bytes transmitted by the vServer to the service and received from the service. In another example the bandwidth threshold may indicate to measure bandwidth of the number of bytes sent from a client to the service via the vServer and sent from the server to the client via the vServer . In other embodiments the bandwidth threshold may indicate to measure bandwidth in one direction such as any of the following directions from the vServer to the service from the service to the vServer from the vServer to the client.

In one embodiment the load monitor and or bandwidth detector measures the bandwidth responsive to any events such as receipt of a network packet. In other embodiments the load monitor and or bandwidth detector may determine whether or not if the measured bandwidth is greater than the bandwidth threshold .

If the connection manager determines from the load monitor and or bandwidth detector that the measured bandwidth of a first vServer A exceeds the bandwidth threshold the connection manager directs client requests for the services managed by the first vServer A to a second vServer . The second vServer may be configured or established as backup server to the first vServer A. For example the first vServer A may be designated a primary vServer A and the second vServer N as backup vServer N. In another embodiment the second vServer N may be another virtual server primary redundant or otherwise for managing the services A N. In yet another embodiment the second vServer N is configures or designated as the spillover virtual server for the first vServer A. In some cases the second vServer N is established upon determining the first vServer A exceeds the bandwidth threshold . In other cases the vServer N is already operating or executing on the appliance .

In some embodiments the connection manager directs new client connection requests to the second vServer . In one embodiment if the request is from a connection already established with the first vServer A the connection manager may direct the request to the first vServer A even if the bandwidth threshold is exceeded. This may be referred to as connection or session persistence. In another embodiment the connection manager directs any client requests to the second vServer for example even a request of a previously established connection.

In one embodiment the connection manager directs client requests to the second vServer N while the first vServer has a measured bandwidth greater than the bandwidth threshold . In another embodiment the connection manager directs clients requests back to the first vServer upon determining that the measured bandwidth of the first vServer has fallen within the bandwidth threshold . In some embodiment the connection manager determines which of the first vServer A and the second vServer N has the lowest bandwidth usage or is the least nearest to the corresponding bandwidth threshold and directs the client requests to the determined vServer. In other embodiments and in the case of multiple vServers A N exceeding a bandwidth threshold the connection manager determines which vServer A N exceeds its corresponding threshold the least and directs the client requests to the determined vServer.

In some embodiments the appliance via a load monitor and or bandwidth detector measures and monitors the bandwidth of the second virtual server N. The second vServer N may have the same bandwidth threshold or a different bandwidth threshold as the first vServer A. If the connection manager determines from the load monitor and or bandwidth detector that the measured bandwidth N of the second vServer N exceeds the bandwidth threshold the connection manager directs client requests for the services managed by the second vServer A to another vServer N such as the first vServer A or a third vServer B. The second vServer N may have a third vServer B designated as backup virtual server or a spillover virtual server. The bandwidth threshold management techniques described herein may be used for a chain or plurality of virtual servers and spillover virtual servers each with a bandwidth threshold and designated backup or spillover virtual server.

The appliance via the connection manager directs client requests to the primary vServer or any backup or spillover vServer based on measured bandwidth in view of the established bandwidth thresholds . The appliance may dynamically adjust any bandwidth threshold for any vServer based on any performance or operational characteristics of the appliance vServer bandwidth network connection client or server. For example the load monitor and or bandwidth detector may measure the bandwidth of the vServer or the network connection based on round trip times packet loss and or MTU. In one embodiment the appliance may determine that the established bandwidth threshold is set relatively low in comparison to the measured bandwidth and determines to dynamically increase the bandwidth threshold . For example the appliance may adjust to the bandwidth threshold within a certain percentage or threshold of the measured bandwidth. In another embodiments the appliance may determine that the established bandwidth threshold is set relatively high in comparison to the measured bandwidth and determines to dynamically decrease the bandwidth threshold .

In one case the appliance dynamically sets or establishes a bandwidth threshold by measuring bandwidth of a vServer for a predetermined time period. For example upon startup of a vServer the bandwidth detector may measure bandwidth for a predetermined or configured time period and then based on an average peak or range of bandwidth measurements set the bandwidth threshold . In yet other examples the appliance may dynamically adjust a bandwidth threshold based on running additional vServers or stopping shutting down or other removing a vServer . In another case the appliance may dynamically adjust a bandwidth threshold based on adding or removing services A managed by a vServer . In still other embodiments the appliance may dynamically adjust the bandwidth threshold of a vServer based on information and feedback from a monitoring agent and or monitoring service . In still other embodiments the appliance may dynamically adjust bandwidth thresholds based on one or more policies of a policy engine .

In some embodiment the appliance excludes a vServer from a load computation or determination or otherwise a load balancing decision if the bandwidth used by the vServer exceeds the bandwidth threshold . In these embodiments this may be done so that the other vServer A N which carry the load for the excluded vServer do not also become overloaded. In other embodiments the appliance adjusts a weight used for the vServer upon detecting the vServer s bandwidth exceeds the bandwidth threshold . For example the weight of the vServer may be adjusted to minimize the impact to the other vServer A N for not having the vServer available to also service requests.

Referring now to an embodiment of steps of a method for practicing dynamic virtual server spillover management based on bandwidth is depicted. In brief overview at step the appliance establishes a first virtual server A which directs requests from a plurality of clients to a plurality of services. At step the appliance establishes a bandwidth threshold for the first virtual server. At step the appliance monitors a status for each of the plurality of services. At step the appliance measures and monitors the bandwidth used by the first vServer . At step the appliance receives a client request. At step the appliance determines whether or not the bandwidth threshold for the first vServer A has been exceeded. If not at step the appliance directs the client request to the first vServer A. If the threshold has been exceeded the appliance at step determines whether or not to establish or use a second vServer N or provide a redirect URL to the client . In one case at step the client is redirected to the service and bypasses the first vServer A. At step the appliance may determine if the client is persistent with the first vServer A or the second vServer N. If the client is sticky to the first vServer A the appliance may direct the request to the first vServer A at step . Otherwise the appliance spills over to an established second vServer N at step . The method may continue at step to monitor and perform spillover management for the second vServer N.

In further detail at step an appliance establishes a first virtual server which manages connections and direct requests from a plurality of clients to a first plurality of services . In one embodiment the appliance may establish the virtual server upon startup of the appliance. In another embodiment the appliance may establish the virtual server in response to a previously established virtual server exceeding maximum connection threshold. In one embodiment the appliance may establish a plurality of virtual servers. In some embodiments a user configures and starts the first vServer . In other embodiments the first vServer is configured established or designed by the appliance or a user as a primary virtual server.

At step the appliance may establish or otherwise provide a bandwidth threshold for the first vServer . In one embodiment the bandwidth threshold may be initially configured by a user or administrator of the appliance. In another embodiment the bandwidth threshold may be initially determined by the appliance by monitoring the bandwidth used by the vServer or by polling one or more services . In some embodiments the appliance may use a default or predetermined bandwidth threshold . For example the appliance may use a predetermined bandwidth threshold associated with or based on the type of service .

At step the appliance may monitor a status for each of the services using any means. In one embodiment the appliance may use a monitoring agent . In another embodiment the appliance may use a plurality of monitoring agents . In one embodiment the appliance may monitor the status for each of the services at predetermined time intervals for example once every 0.01 0.1 0.2 0.5 or 1 seconds. In another embodiment the appliance may monitor the status for each of the services asynchronously or based on any events.

At step the appliance measures and monitors the bandwidth used in association with the first vServer A. The load monitor and or bandwidth detector may compute determine or otherwise make bandwidth measurements . In one embodiment the appliance determines the measured bandwidth of a vServer on a predetermined frequency. In another embodiment the appliance determines the measured bandwidth of a vServer triggered by an event. In one case the appliance determines the measured bandwidth of a vServer at the request of a user. In some embodiments the appliance measures bandwidth based on a number of bytes transferred to and or from a vServer . In other embodiments the appliance measures bandwidth based on round trip times of communication to and or from a vServer . In some embodiments the appliance may dynamically adjust the bandwidth threshold based on bandwidth measurements. In other embodiments the appliance may dynamically adjust the bandwidth threshold based on performance and or operational characteristics of the appliance the vServer the network connection and or the service .

At step the appliance may receive a client request. In one embodiment the appliance intercepts the client request as a transparent interception device. In another embodiment the client transmits the request to the appliance as a proxy. In some embodiments the appliance receives a client request to open or establish a transport layer connection. In other embodiments the appliances receives a client request to access a service via a previously established transport layer connection. The transport layer request may be received from any computing device including a client server or a second appliance . In one embodiment the request may identify a type of service . For example the transport layer request may comprise a request for HTTP service. Or for example the transport layer request may comprise a request for UDP service.

At step the appliance may determine whether the measured bandwidth for a vServer has reached or exceeded the bandwidth threshold . The appliance may compare the current measured bandwidth for the first virtual server with the current value of the bandwidth threshold for the first virtual server. In other embodiments the load monitor and or bandwidth detector may have already determined the bandwidth threshold for the vServer has been reached or exceeded. In another embodiment the appliance may determine if the bandwidth threshold has been reached or exceeded responsive to receiving the client request. If the bandwidth threshold of the first virtual server has not been exceeded the appliance may provide the client request to the first virtual server at step .

If the appliance determines the bandwidth threshold of the first virtual server has been exceeded the appliance may establish use or otherwise spillover to a second virtual server N at step . In other embodiments a second virtual server N may already have been established prior to some or any of the steps shown. In another embodiment the second virtual server N may be established responsive to determining the bandwidth threshold has been exceeded. The second virtual server may provide access to a second plurality of services . In one embodiment one or more of the second plurality of services may comprise the same type of service as one or more of the first plurality of services. The appliance may then establish and or adjust a bandwidth threshold for the second virtual server. The appliance may provide the client request to the second virtual server at step .

In other embodiments if the bandwidth threshold of the first virtual server has been exceeded the appliance may redirect the client making the request to another resource. In one embodiment the appliance may transmit a URL to the client comprising the address of a server or service such that the client may bypass the appliance and access the server or service directly. In one embodiment the appliance may transmit a URL to the client comprising the address of a second appliance . In still another embodiment the appliance may redirect the client request to a second appliance.

At step the appliance may determine whether the client making the request has a previously existing connection or session with either the first or a second virtual server. In some embodiments an appliance may assign a priority to providing requests from a client to virtual servers that have previously serviced or are currently servicing connections or session from the client. For example if a request is received from a client and the client has a currently existing connection with a first virtual server the appliance may provide the request to the first virtual server even if the first virtual server has reached or exceeded the bandwidth threshold. Or for example if a client has a previous connection via a backup virtual server and the primary virtual server subsequently falls below the bandwidth threshold the appliance may still provide a subsequent request from the client to the backup virtual server. In one embodiment a connection management mechanism or other appliance component may track previously established or current connections or session so that incoming requests from a client can be provided to a virtual server having previously serviced the connection or session from the client.

At step the appliance may dynamically manage virtual spillover based on bandwidth by directing or providing the client request to the spillover or second vServer N. In some embodiments the appliance determines the second vServer is busy unavailable or has exceeded its bandwidth threshold or another threshold. In response the appliance may redirect the client at step or provide the client request to a third vServer B or another appliance . In some embodiments the appliance has a plurality of vServers A N managing the services and determines which vServer to direct the client request based on comparison of each vServer s measured bandwidth and or bandwidth threshold. In one case the appliance provides the client request to one of a plurality of backup or spillover vServers based on the least measured bandwidth. In another case the appliance provides the client request to the vServer with the greatest difference between the measured bandwidth and the bandwidth threshold.

Although an embodiment of method is generally described above in regards to measuring and monitoring bandwidth of a first vServer and spilling over to a second vServer any steps of the method may be performed for the second vServer and a spillover server for the second vServer and for a third vServer and so on. An embodiment of method or any steps thereof may be practiced for a plurality of virtual servers such as a set of primary vServer managing the same or different services. Another embodiment of method or any steps thereof may be practiced for a chain of spillover virtual servers so that a second vServer spills over into a third vServer based on bandwidth and so on.

Furthermore any of the systems and method discussed herein may be practiced in combination. For example the techniques of dynamic connection spillover management described in conjunction with may be practiced with the bandwidth based spillover management described in conjunction with . In some embodiment the appliance may establish monitor and manage spillover of virtual servers based on multiple thresholds. For example the appliance may use both connection based thresholds and bandwidth based thresholds to determine to spillover a client request from one virtual server to another. In one embodiment the appliance may spillover from one virtual server to another virtual server when both thresholds are reached or exceeded. In another embodiment the appliance may spillover from one virtual server to another virtual server when either of the thresholds are reached or exceeded.

In some embodiments the techniques of bandwidth based virtual server switching and spillover management described above may be combined with the content switching functionality and policies of the appliance to provide bandwidth management of a virtual server on an object basis. The appliance may be configured to have a set of one or more virtual servers to manage requests and response of predetermined object types. A first virtual server may be configured to provide requests to a second virtual server if the request identifies an object matching a pattern such as a pattern of URL or file extension. For example the first virtual server may direct the second virtual server to handle all image file requests with the extension of .jpg or .gif. For these object types the second virtual server manages requests and response of a plurality of services. The second virtual server may also be under bandwidth management by the appliance and have a bandwidth threshold. The appliance via one or more monitoring agents monitor the second virtual server to determine if the bandwidth used by the second virtual server in handling the requests for these object types is exceeded. If the threshold is exceeded the appliance or first virtual server may spillover handling of the requests of these object types to another virtual server. Or in some cases the appliance may provide a redirect URL to the client or redirect the client s request to another appliance a server or to the service.

Referring now to an embodiment of an appliance for practicing a technique of object based bandwidth switching and spillover management is depicted. In brief overview the appliance establishes a first vServer A to manage access by a plurality of clients to one or more virtual servers A N which in turn manager access to one or more services A N of a first set of servers A N. The appliance includes a connection management mechanism for managing and balancing requests from clients to the vServers. A first vServer A may be configured via a policy engine and or via content switching to direct requests from clients to one or more vServer A N based on the type of object A or objects identified via the request. In some cases a policy of a policy engine provides logic or rules to determine which requests are forwarded by the first vServer to one of the plurality of vServer A N . For example the first vServer may direct all requests matching a pattern for a URL may be transmitted to a second vServer A. Another vServer N may be configured to direct client request matching another policy or object type N to a second set of one or more vServers A N .

The appliance establishes for any of the object handling vServers A N a bandwidth threshold A. This bandwidth threshold may be established by the appliance or specified by the user. Via monitoring agents A N the appliance monitors the operational status of each of the object handling vServers A N and corresponding services A N. For example as previously discussed above the monitoring agents may use a bandwidth detector to determine or measure bandwidth usage by a virtual server. If the measured bandwidth for a second vServer A is determined to have reached or exceeded the bandwidth threshold A the first virtual server A and or connection manager of the appliance may determine to direct client requests to a spillover vServer B which may handle requests for the same object type as the second vServer A. For example a user may configure a bandwidth threshold of 5 Mbytes per second for graphic image object types such as files with a .jpg extension. If the bandwidth detector determines the measured bandwidth of the vServer A exceeds 5 Mbytes a second the appliance may switch or spillover client requests to another vServer N .

In some embodiments a virtual server may be designed constructed or configured to manage other virtual servers. In one embodiment a virtual server A N may be designed constructed or configured to direct requests to other virtual servers based on any type and form of object type.

In one embodiment the vServer A N identifies an object type by a type of protocol used for the request.

In other embodiments a vServer A is designed to determine which requests to forward or provide to other virtual servers responsive to a policy engine . In some embodiments the policy engine includes one or more policies which identify rules for which the vServer A N may direct client requests to one of the other vServers A N . In one embodiment the policy identifies to a vServer A N any portion of content of a network packet or of a request to associate with an object type or otherwise direct to a vServer A N. In another embodiment the policy identifies to a vServer A N any portion of content of a network packet or of a request to direct to a predetermined set of one or more services . In other embodiments the policy provides rules for matching any patterns of the rule to requests to associate with or identify an object type. For example the policy may identify a string pattern for a portion of a URL. In another example the policy may specify a pattern or rule for name of a file or portion thereof. In further examples the policy may specify a pattern or rule for a file extensions. In still other cases the policy may specify a web page name with an object type. In another case the policy may specify a source and or destination IP address and or port with an object type. In one case the policy may specify a type of protocol to associate or identify an object type. The policy engine and or polices may specify any portion of a network packet such as any data element of a header or payload to use to identify an object type or otherwise indicate to a vServer A N to provide requests to other vServer A N or services .

In view of the various ways to identify types of objects an object type may comprise any type and form of categorization classification grouping or identification. An object type may be an identification of an object as a certain type or belong to a group or classification. Any data or information included in referenced by or associated with a client request may used to identify an object or type thereof. An object type may also be referred to or considered an object identifier. In one embodiment an object type A N may be based on groups of one or more object types. In other embodiments an object type A N may be granular and based on a specific name reference or instance of an object. In some embodiments the object type comprises types of files by name content or extension. For example a first object type A may includes objects having a first file name extension and a second object type N may include objects having a second file name extension. In another example an object type A may include a group of objects such as any object having one of a plurality of file name extensions. In yet further examples the object type may identify any type and form of media such as voice audio data or any combination.

In other embodiments an object type is based on a pattern for a URL. In another embodiment an object type is based on a destination portion of a URL. In some embodiments the object type may be based on a domain or server identified by a URL. In one embodiment the object type may include URLs that identify a specified web page. In some embodiments an object type may include a set or group of one or more URL patterns or portions of URLs. In yet other embodiments an object type is based on a source and or destination of the request. In one embodiment the object type is based on the type of protocol used by the request. In other embodiments the object type is based on an information of a header or payload of a packet s for the request.

In still other embodiments a user may configure or identify object types A N in any desired combination arrangement or manner. In one embodiment a user may specify an object type to be any URL pattern. In another embodiment a user may specify an object type to be any pattern for a resource or file identified in the request. In some embodiments the user may specify any IP address and or port to be used to identify an object type. In other embodiments the user may specify any portion of a network packet such as any header field or data in a payload as identifying an object type . In still further embodiments a user may specify any matching portion of a request to be associated with an object type.

As illustrated in multiple vServers A N may be configured designed or constructed to direct client requests based on a multiple object types A N to a plurality of vServers A N and A N . A first vServer A may be configured to forward requests corresponding to a first object type to one or more vServers A N which manage one or more services A N. A second vServer N may be configured to forward requests corresponding to a second object type N to a second set of one or more vServers A N which manage one or more services A N . For example the first vServer A may direct requests corresponding to graphical image related object types to a second vServer A . The second vServer N may direct requests corresponding to predetermined URL patterns to a third vServer A . In some cases the second vServer N may direct request corresponding to the object types handled by the first vServer A to the second set of vServers A N .

The appliance may have a plurality of a first set of vServers A N directing requests to a plurality of other vServers A N and A N based on a multitude of object types A N. Object types A N or policies thereof may be configured by a user to have a wide range of different types from broad groupings to very granular object identifiers. For example a first vServer A may directs requests corresponding to a more broad classification of object types that are identifies as an HTTP object. In another example a second vServer N may directs requests corresponding to a more narrow identification of an object type such a file by a specific name or a specific URL or portion of a URL.

Referring now to an embodiment of steps of a method for practicing an object and bandwidth based virtual spillover management and switching technique is depicted. In brief overview at step the appliance establishes a first virtual server A which directs requests from a plurality of clients corresponding to an object type to one or more virtual servers A N such as a second virtual server A . At step the appliance establishes a bandwidth threshold for the second virtual server. At step the appliance monitors a status for each of the plurality of virtual servers and corresponding to services. At step the appliance measures and monitors the bandwidth used by the second vServer A . At step the appliance receives a client request. At step the appliance determines whether or not the bandwidth threshold for the second vServer A has been exceeded. If not at step the appliance directs the client request to the second vServer A . If the threshold has been exceeded the appliance at step determines whether or not to establish or use a third vServer N or provide a redirect URL to the client . In one case at step the client is redirected to the service and bypasses the second vServer A . At step the appliance may determine if the client is persistent with the second vServer A . If the client is sticky or persistent to the second vServer A the appliance may direct the request to the second vServer A at step . Otherwise the appliance spills over to an established third vServer N at step . The method may continue at step to monitor and perform object based spillover management for the third vServer N.

In further detail at step an appliance establishes a first virtual server A which manages connections and direct requests from a plurality of clients to a first set of one or more vServers A N . The first set of one or more vServers A N may manage such as load balance one or more services . The first vServer A may be configured to direct request identifying a first object type A to a first set of one or more vServers A N such as a second vServer A . In some embodiments the first vServer A determines or identifies object types from a request responsive to one or more policies of a policy engine . In another embodiment the first vServer N determines which vServer A N to direct the request responsive to a policy and or the policy engine . In one embodiment the appliance may establish a plurality of virtual servers A N each vServer A N direct client requests based on a different object type or the same object type.

At step the appliance may establish or otherwise provide a bandwidth threshold for any of the object handling vServers such as the second vServer A . In one embodiment the bandwidth threshold may be initially configured by a user or administrator of the appliance. In another embodiment the bandwidth threshold may be initially determined by the appliance by monitoring the bandwidth used by the vServer or by polling one or more services . In some embodiments the appliance may use a default or predetermined bandwidth threshold . For example the appliance may use a predetermined bandwidth threshold associated with or based on the type of service . In other embodiments the bandwidth thresholds may be established by the appliance or user based on the object type. In one case a vServer A may be configured to have a bandwidth threshold A for a first object type and another vServer N may be configured with a bandwidth threshold N having a different threshold value than bandwidth threshold A. For example a vServer A processing requests for media content such as video audio may be designated with a larger bandwidth threshold A than a vServer B handlings requests for smaller files or web pages.

At step the appliance may monitor a status of any of the vServers and any vServers or services under management. In one embodiment the appliance may use a monitoring agent . In another embodiment the appliance may use a plurality of monitoring agents A N. In one embodiment the appliance may monitor the status for each or any of the vServers A N at predetermined time intervals for example once every 0.01 0.1 0.2 0.5 or 1 seconds. In another embodiment the appliance may monitor the status for each or any of the vServers A N asynchronously or based on any events.

At step the appliance measures and monitors the bandwidth used by any of the vServers A N receiving client communications directed from the first vServer A. The load monitor and or bandwidth detector may compute determine or otherwise make bandwidth measurements . In one embodiment the appliance determines the measured bandwidth of a vServer on a predetermined frequency. In another embodiment the appliance determines the measured bandwidth of a vServer triggered by an event. In one case the appliance determines the measured bandwidth of a vServer at the request of a user. In some embodiments the appliance measures bandwidth based on a number of bytes transferred to and or from a vServer . In other embodiments the appliance measures bandwidth based on round trip times of communication to and or from a vServer . In some embodiments the appliance may dynamically adjust the bandwidth threshold based on bandwidth measurements. In other embodiments the appliance may dynamically adjust the bandwidth threshold based on performance and or operational characteristics of the appliance the vServer the network connection and or the service .

At step the appliance may receive a client request. In some embodiments the client request is for one or more objects having an object type . In one embodiment the client request includes a URL matching identifying associated with or corresponding to an object type . In another embodiment the client request includes a file name reference type or extension identifying or associated with an object type . In one embodiment the appliance intercepts the client request as a transparent interception device. In another embodiment the client transmits the request to the appliance as a proxy. In other embodiments the appliances receives a client request to access a service via a previously established transport layer connection. The transport layer request may be received from any computing device including a client server or a second appliance . In one embodiment the request may identify a type of service which may be associated with or other identify an object type . In yet another embodiment the appliance applies a policy to any portion or content the client request to identify or determine the object type .

In other embodiments the client request identifies a plurality of object types A N. In these embodiments the first vServer A directing traffic to the other vServers A N may split the request up according to each of the plurality of object types A N. For example the first vServer A may directs a first portion of the request corresponding to a first object type to a second vServer A and a second portion of the request corresponding to a second object type to a third vServer N . In another example the first vServer A directs a first portion of the request identifying a first object type A to vServer A while a second vServer B directs a second portion of the request identifying a second object type N to another vServer N . In some embodiments the first vServer A may direct a client request having a plurality of object types A N to a single second vServer A . The handling of multiple object types A N may be specified by a policy of which object type A N has priority in switching decisions for virtual servers.

At step the appliance may determine whether the measured bandwidth for an object handling vServer A N has reached or exceeded the corresponding bandwidth threshold A N. For example the appliance may compare the current measured bandwidth A for the second first virtual server A handling a first object type with the current value of the bandwidth threshold A for the second virtual server. In other embodiments the load monitor and or bandwidth detector may have already determined the bandwidth threshold for the second vServer A has been reached or exceeded. In another embodiment the appliance may determine if the bandwidth threshold has been reached or exceeded responsive to receiving the client request. If the bandwidth threshold of the second vServer A the appliance may provide the client request to the second virtual server at step .

If the appliance determines the bandwidth threshold of the second virtual server A has been exceeded the appliance may establish use or otherwise spillover to a third virtual server N at step . The third virtual server N may handle client requests corresponding to the object type of the second virtual server A . In other embodiments a third virtual server N may already have been established prior to some or any of the steps shown. In another embodiment the third virtual server N may be established responsive to determining the bandwidth threshold has been exceeded. The second virtual server may provide access to the object type via a second plurality of services . In one embodiment one or more of the second plurality of services may comprise the same type of service as one or more of the first plurality of services. The appliance may then establish and or adjust a bandwidth threshold for the third virtual server. The appliance may provide the client request to the second virtual server N at step .

In other embodiments if the bandwidth threshold of the second virtual server A has been exceeded the appliance may redirect the client making the request to another resource. In one embodiment the appliance may transmit a URL to the client comprising the address of a server or service such that the client may bypass the appliance and access the server or service directly. In one embodiment the appliance may transmit a URL to the client comprising the address of a second appliance . In still another embodiment the appliance may redirect the client request to a second appliance.

At step the appliance may determine whether the client making the request has a previously existing connection or session with either the first or a second virtual server. In some embodiments an appliance may assign a priority to providing requests from a client to virtual servers that have previously serviced or are currently servicing connections or session from the client. For example if a request is received from a client and the client has a currently existing connection with a third virtual server N the appliance may provide the request to the third virtual server even if the second virtual server A has reached or exceeded the bandwidth threshold. Or for example if a client has a previous connection via a backup virtual server and the primary virtual server subsequently falls below the bandwidth threshold the appliance may still provide a subsequent request from the client to the backup virtual server. In one embodiment a connection management mechanism or other appliance component may track previously established or current connections or session so that incoming requests from a client can be provided to a virtual server having previously serviced the connection or session from the client.

At step the appliance may dynamically manage virtual spillover based on bandwidth and object types by directing or providing the client request to the spillover or third vServer N . In some embodiments the appliance determines the third vServer N handling a first object type is busy unavailable or has exceeded its bandwidth threshold or another threshold. In response the appliance may redirect the client at step or provide the client request to a fourth vServer B handling the first object type or another appliance . In some embodiments the appliance has a plurality of vServers A N handling objects corresponding to an object type and determines which vServer to direct the client request based on comparison of each vServer s measured bandwidth and or bandwidth threshold. In one case the appliance provides the client request to one of a plurality of backup or spillover vServers configured to handle the object type based on the least measured bandwidth. In another case the appliance provides the client request to the vServer handling the object type with the greatest difference between the measured bandwidth and the bandwidth threshold.

Although an embodiment of method is generally described above in regards to measuring and monitoring bandwidth of a second vServer managed by a first vServer and spilling over to a third or fourth vServer any steps of the method may be performed for the third spillover vServer fourth spillover vServer and so on. An embodiment of method or any steps thereof may be practiced for a plurality of virtual servers managing a plurality of other virtual servers each handling a plurality of object types. Another embodiment of method or any steps thereof may be practiced for a chain of spillover virtual servers so that a second vServer spills over into a third vServer based on bandwidth and object types and the third vServer into a fourth vServer and so on.

Furthermore any of the systems and method discussed herein may be practiced in combination. For example the techniques of dynamic connection spillover management described in conjunction with may be practiced with the object based bandwidth based spillover management described in conjunction with . In some embodiment the appliance may establish monitor and manage spillover of virtual servers based on multiple thresholds. For example the appliance may use both connection based thresholds and bandwidth based thresholds to determine to spillover from one virtual server to another for handling a client request identifying an object type. In one embodiment the appliance may spillover from one virtual server to another virtual server when both thresholds are reached or exceeded and for a certain object type. For example for processing client requests of a first object type the second vServer managed by the first vServer may have a connection capacity threshold and a bandwidth threshold. Another object handling vServer may have different connection capacity threshold and or bandwidth threshold. In another embodiment the appliance may spillover from one virtual server to another virtual server for handling objects of a certain type when either of the thresholds are reached or exceeded.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific embodiments it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims
