This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60 747 448 filed on May 17 2006 which application is hereby incorporated by reference.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

Grenades such as the M67 fragmentation hand grenade are widely used in the field by the US Army and US Marine Corps. The present fuze for the M67 hand grenade does not comply with the Insensitive Munitions IM requirements. This problem relates to the C70 Detonator used in the fuze. The detonator contains large quantities of lead based primary explosives lead azide lead styphnate as well as RDX. These explosives initiate the grenade under many of the IM test conditions. Safety issues in combination with the environmental compliance requirements for use of lead compounds make the manufacture of these detonators an unattractive investment for US based manufacturers.

A need exists for a new hand grenade fuze. The new fuze must not impact the lethality of the present design M67 while meeting the IM safety requirements. It also should reduce the item s total life cycle cost and the soldiers and environment s exposure to lead.

It is another object of the invention to provide a hand grenade fuze that contains much less lead than existing fuzes.

One aspect of the invention is a detonator for a hand grenade fuze comprising a detonator case a slider that is transversely reciprocable in the detonator case from an unarmed position to an armed position the slider including a longitudinal through hole filled with a primary explosive a spring that biases the slider to the unarmed position an arming mechanism attached to the slider for moving the slider to an armed position the arming mechanism comprising a shape memory alloy an explosive lead disposed below the slider and a booster charge disposed below the explosive lead. The arming mechanism may comprise a pull strip or rod that shrinks when heated.

Another aspect of the invention is a grenade fuze comprising the inventive detonator and a delay mix disposed above the slider.

Yet another aspect of the invention is a method of arming the inventive grenade comprising igniting the delay mix heating the arming mechanism with heat from the delay mix and using the arming mechanism to move the slider in line with the explosive lead.

Still another aspect of the invention is a method comprising externally heating the grenade until the arming mechanism moves the slider in line with the explosive lead and further externally heating the grenade until the arming mechanism melts and the spring forces the slider out of line with the explosive lead.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

To produce an IM compliant detonator the invention uses an out of line slider with a memory metal mechanism that acts as the arming mechanism for the fuze train. When the safety pin is pulled the delay column is set off. Heat produced by the burning of the delay column activates the memory metal mechanism which moves the out of line slider to an in line position. The memory metal mechanism may take a variety of forms such as strips rods etc.

With memory metal strips heat produced by the delay column causes the memory metal strips to push or pull the slider to the in line position thereby initiating the primary explosive. The primary explosive initiates the lead explosive which sets off the booster. In one embodiment a memory metal restraining rod shrinks due to the heat produced from the delay column thereby releasing the slider. The primary explosive is a greatly reduced quantity compared to known detonators of lead azide or a heavy metal free compound. The invention may use the existing C70 detonator case.

The C70 detonator includes a column of lead styphnate lead azide and RDX in a detonator case . The detonator is massive containing approximately 10 times more lead styphnate lead azide and RDX than other detonators. The massive size of the detonator is not simply a case of over engineering. The length of the detonator is required to properly initiate the grenade s explosive fill for proper fragmentation. The diameter of the detonator is dictated by the dimensions of the fuze body .

The known fuze train is simple and has functioned well and reliably in grenades for decades. Unfortunately the known fuze train has major safety issues. Any unwanted stimulus that causes the primer to function like fire initiates the entire fuze train. The large quantities of primary explosive in the detonator can also be detonated by external stimuli with enough energy to function the entire grenade . These problems are exacerbated through sympathetic detonation when many grenades are in the same location.

In the embodiment of detonator includes a detonator case a slider assembly an explosive lead and a booster . The slider assembly comprises a slider that is generally transversely reciprocable in detonator case a spring that biases the slider out of line with the delay mix and explosive lead and an arming mechanism made of shape memory alloy SMA . Slider has a vertical through hole filled with primary explosive . An explosive lead and booster charge may both be PBXN 5 for example.

Arming mechanism may comprise one or more of pull strips rods or other suitable shapes. Any shape memory arming mechanism may be used as long as it responds to the heat generated by the delay mix by moving the slider to the in line position. For simplicity it is assumed that the arming mechanism comprises pull strips.

In the unarmed state the spring biases the slider to one side such that the primary explosive is not aligned with either the delay mix or the explosive lead . In the armed state the pin has been pulled and the primer has ignited the delay mix . Heat from the ignition of the delay mix causes the SMA pull strips to shrink. The shrinkage of the SMA pull strips overcomes the force of spring and pulls the slider to a position where the primary explosive is aligned with the delay mix and the explosive lead . The delay mix sets off the primary explosive which sets off the explosive lead which ignites the booster . The booster initiates the explosive fill in the grenade.

To eliminate lead from the fuze a lead free primary explosive must be used in place of the lead styphnate and lead azide . An exemplary lead free primary explosive is cyanuric triazide referred to as triazide . Triazide is a heavy metal free material containing three azide groups bonded to a ring of carbon and nitrogen. Tests have shown triazide to behave like a primary explosive and have demonstrated its ability to function as part of a fuze train.

One IM test involves shooting a bullet into the most sensitive portion of a munition. The most sensitive portion of the inventive fuze is the primary explosive . If a bullet is shot into the triazide with the slider in the unarmed position the triazide is expected to ignite but neither the delay mix or the explosive lead should be initiated because the triazide is not in the armed position.

Another IM test is cook off. Cook off of a grenade with fuze initially results in the pull strips pulling the slider into the armed position . The material comprising the pull strips is selected so that the melting temperature of the strips is significantly less than the initiation temperature of any of the explosives in the grenade. Therefore as the temperature increases the pull strips will melt and fail and the spring will force the slider back to the unarmed position . Then when the primary explosive finally ignites it is out of line with both the delay mix and the explosive lead .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
