The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

This Application Relates to patent application Ser. No. 10 816 032 entitled Hypergolic Bipropellants by Hawkins et al. filed on 2 Apr. 2004.

A conventional storable bipropulsion system uses a hydrazine e.g. monomethylhydrazine as the fuel component. This fuel affords useful performance characteristics and has a fast ignition with the oxidizer. This fast hypergolic ignition provides system reliability for on demand action of the propulsion system. The conventional storable bipropulsion system is limited by its inherent energy density that can be traced in large measure to the density of the fuel. Also there are significant costs and operational constraints associated with handling the fuel that derives from the fuel s very toxic vapor.

The challenge is made more difficult since the fuel oxidizer combination is desired to be hypergolic. Hypergolicity is defined as self ignition that occurs within milliseconds after contact of fuel with oxidizer herein fast ignition . Hypergolic ignition is valuable because it offers high reliability eliminates the inert mass of a separate ignition system and provides an ability to restart for missions that require multipulse operation.

Accordingly there is need and market for hypergolic bipropellants that overcome the above prior art shortcomings.

There has now been developed ionic hypergolic bipropellant fuels of reduced toxicity as also described below.

a salt or IL fuel containing at least one dicyanamide anion and at least one heterocyclic based cation and b an oxidizer for same. Preferred are oxidizer fuel ratios ranging from 1 1 to 7 1 wt wt .

Referring to the present invention in detail advanced bipropellant fuels with fast ignition upon mixing with storable oxidizer have been synthesized and demonstrated.

The bipropellant fuels are based upon salts containing the dicyanamide anion FIG. 1 . The salts employ nitrogen containing heterocyclic based cations such as the imidazolium cation FIG. 2 .

Reactivity of a range of substituted imidazolium dicyanamides with red fuming nitric acid was performed. Representative experimental results are shown in Table 1. Fast ignition i.e. ignition occurring on the order of 10millisecond or lower is observed with these dicyanamide based ionic liquid IL fuels upon contact with the liquid oxidizer.

The critical role of the dicyanamide anion in effecting the chemistry necessary for fast ignition can be observed in the data from Table 2. The table displays ignition test results with two ionic liquid fuels that contain the same cation but have different anions. While salt molecules contain highly energetic i.e. positive formation enthalpy high nitrogen anions the dicyanamide based molecule solely displays fast ignition.

With employment of a dicyanamide anion a range of heterocyclic based ionic liquids ILs are available as high energy density fuels for bipropulsion applications. These ILs may incorporate not only the substituted imidazolium cation but can employ the substituted 1 2 4 triazolium substituted 1 2 3 triazolium substituted pyrollidinium substituted pyridinium and substituted tetrazolium cations. FIG. 3 shows such representative structures.

FIG. 3. Substituted 1 2 4 triazolium 1 2 3 triazolium pyrrolidinium pyridinium and tetrazolium cations respectively

In the preferred embodiment of the invention the substituents to the heterocyclic ring of the cation confer low melting points and low viscosity while also incorporating structures that increase heat of combustion of the fuel with the storable liquid oxidizer. Such substituent i.e. R group structures may be saturated alkyl unsaturated e.g. alkenyl or alkynyl strained ring e.g. cyclopropyl or high nitrogen moieties e.g. azido cyano amino or hydrazino .

Further aspects of the invention are discussed in a Paper entitled by T. Hawkins et al soon to be submitted to Angewandte Chemie of Germany for publication which Paper is incorporated herein by reference. In the Paper is discussed the preparation of certain dicyanamides as illustrated in the following example 

The starting materials 1 R 3 methylimidazolium bromides 1 5 below were prepared by alkylation of methylimidazole followed by metathesis with freshly prepared silver dicyanamide Scheme 1 .

General procedure for preparation of salts 1 5 and 6 . To a 100 mL Schlenk flask equipped with a Teflon stir bar and purged with nitrogen the 1 R 3 methyl imidazolium bromides or 1 methyl 4 amino 1 2 4 triazolium iodide were added and dissolved in ca. 30 mL of methanol. In the dark a ca. 5 excess of freshly prepared silver dicyanamide was added to the stirred solution. Stirring was continued over night. The insoluble silver halide and excess silver dicyanamide were removed by filtration. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure yielding the desired ionic liquid dicyanamides.

1 allyl 3 methyl imidazolium dicyanamide 1 . 14.0 g 69.3 mmol 1 allyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide was used for the metathesis. Yield 94 red liquid 

1 3 butenyl 3 methyl imidazolium dicyanamide 2 . 1.8 g 8.3 mmol 1 3 butenyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide was used for the metathesis. Yield 93 amber liquid 

1 propargyl 3 methyl imidazolium dicyanamide 3 . 5.8 g 28.8 mmol 1 3 butenyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide was used for the metathesis. Yield 86 dark red liquid

1 2 butynyl 3 methyl imidazolium dicyanamide 4 . 1.1 g 5.3 mmol 1 2 butynyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide was used for the metathesis. Yield 97 amber solid 

1 2 pentynyl 3 methyl imidazolium dicyanamide 5 . 1.3 g 5.7 mmol 1 2 pentynyl 3 methyl imidazolium bromide was used for the metathesis. Yield 79 after recrystallization from methanol solution layered with diethyl ether dark brown solid 

1 methyl 4 amino 1 2 4 triazolium dicyanamide 6 . 0.7 g 3.3 mmol 1 methyl 4 amino 1 2 4 triazolium iodide was used for the metathesis. Yield 89 colorless liquid.

The above dicyanamides are then combined with suitable oxidizers per the invention such as RFNA IRFNA WFNA hydrogen peroxide and NTO to provide the hypergolic bipropellants of the invention. Scheme 2 indicates applicable oxidizer structures to the invention 

In operation the bipropellant of the invention is utilized as follows. The IL fuel is stored in a propulsion system fuel tank and the oxidizer is stored in a separate tank. When thrust is desired the fuel and oxidizer are each sprayed through injector elements into a chamber in a rocket and the fuel and oxidizer then come into contact. Ignition immediately ensues and combustion of the fuel by the oxidizer creates pressurized gases that provide thrust as they exit a propulsion nozzle.

Thus advanced bipropellant fuels with fast ignition upon mixing with storable oxidizer have been synthesized and demonstrated per the invention. The bipropellant fuels are based upon salts containing the dicyanamide anion and employ nitrogen containing heterocycle based cations such as the imidazolium triazolium or tetrazolium cations.

Fast igniting ionic liquid fuels provide a means to overcome significant limitations of the state of the art storable bipropulsion system. Such ionic liquid fuels can provide greater than 40 improvement in density over hydrazine fuels. This confers greater energy density to the bipropulsion system. Also the negligible vapor pressure of ionic liquid fuel provides a means of significantly reducing costs and operational constraints associated with handling the fuel.

Ignition of propellants often constitutes a major hurdle in propellant development. Therefore discovering an IL which shows hypergolic ignition with common oxidizers represents a major achievement. Compounds 1 3 above are in fact the first ILs demonstrated to be hypergolic.

A preferred embodiment of the invention is the employment of pure dicyanamide based ionic liquid as a fast igniting bipropellant fuel. However the use of dicyanamide salt molecules as components in fuel mixtures to confer fast ignition and density is also a viable mode of the invention.

A hypergolic bipropellant based upon ionic liquid fuel dicyanamide based IL and an oxidizer RFNA has potential as a replacement for bipropellant currently used in on orbit spacecraft propulsion. Other application areas include liquid engines for boost and divert propulsion. The high volumetric impulse that is inherent in the new hypergol lends itself to applications that require high performance from volume limited systems. The low vapor toxicity of the ionic liquid fuel is a benefit over toxic hydrazine fuels currently used.

The performance aspects of this new hypergol can find use in commercial applications in satellite deployment and commercial space launch activities.
