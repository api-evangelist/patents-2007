A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present concepts relate generally to gaming machines and methods for playing wagering games and more particularly to a wagering game having a dynamic camera display feature.

Gaming machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the likelihood or perceived likelihood of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same or believed to be the same players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines features and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore there is a continuing need for gaming machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and improved gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play through enhanced entertainment value to the player.

One concept that has been successfully employed to enhance the entertainment value of a game is the concept of a secondary or bonus game that may be played in conjunction with a basic game. The bonus game may comprise any type of game either similar to or completely different from the basic game which is entered upon the occurrence of a selected event or outcome in the basic game. Generally bonus games provide a greater expectation of winning than the basic game and may also be accompanied with more attractive or unusual video displays and or audio. Bonus games may additionally award players with progressive jackpot awards that are funded at least in part by a percentage of coin in from the gaming machine or a plurality of participating gaming machines. Because the bonus game concept offers tremendous advantages in player appeal and excitement relative to other known games and because such games are attractive to both players and operators there is a continuing need to develop gaming machines with new types of bonus games to satisfy the demands of players and operators.

Many current wagering games include a display generally displaying a broad view of the game with numerous small game elements e.g. characters graphics or the like of the game thereon. This type of view may be desirable to allow the player to view the entire gaming environment. For example all of a plurality of player selectable elements may be shown simultaneously to a player. One drawback however to displaying only a broad view of the game is that the individual game elements must be relatively small for all of the elements to fit on the display. Because of their small size many game elements of current wagering games lack substantial detail. This lack of detail may cause the game elements to look generic. Thus the player s anticipation and excitement may be limited thereby decreasing the ability of the wagering game to draw the player into the game. Further such views of the entire gaming environment are generally static views that over time may seem stale to frequent players.

Therefore there is a need for a wagering game to improve the available views of the elements of the wagering game.

According to one aspect of the present invention a gaming system for playing a wagering game includes an input device for receiving a wager to play a wagering game a display and a controller. The controller is configured to display a three dimensional view of at least a portion of a gaming environment and one or more movable visual elements disposed within the gaming environment. The controller is further configured to dynamically retain within the field of view a center point of a selected set of the movable visual elements.

According to another aspect of the invention a method of conducting a wagering game on a gaming system comprises the act of positioning a virtual camera at a first point within a gaming environment to provide a first three dimensional view of one or more movable visual elements in the gaming environment at a first point in time. The further includes the acts of randomly determining a position of a movable visual element at a second point in time and moving the movable visual element toward the position. The act also includes repositioning a view point of the camera to a second view point within the gaming environment to provide a second three dimensional view of the one or more movable visual elements preceding concurrent with or following a movement of at least one movable visual element. The repositioning of the camera to the second point comprises moving the camera from the first point to the second point while at least substantially maintaining a view of the one or more movable visual elements.

According to yet another aspect of the invention a computer readable storage medium is encoded with instructions for directing a gaming system to perform the above method.

According to yet another aspect of the invention a gaming system comprises an input device for receiving a wager to play a wagering game and at least one display for displaying a gaming environment. The gaming environment comprises a path including a plurality of stations and one or more visual elements moving in relation to the gaming environment. The display is adapted to display a three dimensional view of the gaming environment from a camera positioned at a dynamically selected view point the dynamically selected view point being determined by a controller to retain within a field of view of the camera view a center point of the moving visual elements.

Additional aspects of the present concepts will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the detailed description of various aspects and embodiments which is made with reference to the drawings a brief description of which is provided below.

While the present concepts are susceptible of embodiment in many different forms there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail preferred embodiments of the present concepts with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the present concepts and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the present concepts to the embodiments illustrated.

Alternatively the gaming machine may be a slant top version in which the primary display is slanted at about a thirty degree angle toward the player of the gaming machine .

A player begins play of the basic wagering game by making a wager via the value input device of the gaming machine . A player can select play by using the player input device via the buttons or the touch screen keys . The basic game consists of a plurality of symbols arranged in an array and includes at least one payline that indicates one or more outcomes of the basic game. Such outcomes are randomly selected in response to the wagering input by the player. At least one of the plurality of randomly selected outcomes may be a start bonus outcome which can include any variations of symbols or symbol combinations triggering a bonus game.

In some embodiments the gaming machine may also include a player information reader that allows for identification of a player by reading a card with information indicating his or her true identity. The player information reader is shown in as a card reader but may take on many forms including a ticket reader bar code scanner RFID transceiver or computer readable storage medium interface. Currently identification is generally used by casinos for rewarding certain players with complimentary services or special offers. For example a player may be enrolled in the gaming establishment s loyalty club and may be awarded certain complimentary services as that player collects points in his or her player tracking account. The player inserts his or her card into the player information reader which allows the casino s computers to register that player s wagering at the gaming machine . The gaming machine may use the secondary display or other dedicated player tracking display for providing the player with information about his or her account or other player specific information. Also in some embodiments the information reader may be used to restore game assets that the player achieved and saved during a previous game session.

Depicted in is a handheld or mobile gaming machine . Like the free standing gaming machine the handheld gaming machine is preferably an electronic gaming machine configured to play a video casino game such as but not limited to blackjack slots keno poker blackjack and roulette. The handheld gaming machine comprises a housing or casing and includes input devices including a value input device and a player input device . For output the handheld gaming machine includes but is not limited to a primary display a secondary display one or more speakers one or more player accessible ports e.g. an audio output jack for headphones a video headset jack etc. and other conventional I O devices and ports which may or may not be player accessible.

The optional secondary display may be fixed movable and or detachable attachable relative to the primary display . Either the primary display and or secondary display may be configured to display any aspect of a non wagering game wagering game secondary games bonus games progressive wagering games group games shared experience games or events game events game outcomes scrolling information text messaging emails alerts or announcements broadcast information subscription information and handheld gaming machine status.

The player accessible value input device may comprise for example a slot located on the front side or top of the casing configured to receive credit from a stored value card e.g. casino card smart card debit card credit card etc. inserted by a player. In another aspect the player accessible value input device may comprise a sensor e.g. an RF sensor configured to sense a signal e.g. an RF signal output by a transmitter e.g. an RF transmitter carried by a player. The player accessible value input device may also or alternatively include a ticket reader or barcode scanner for reading information stored on a credit ticket a card or other tangible portable credit or funds storage device. The credit ticket or card may also authorize access to a central account which can transfer money to the handheld gaming machine .

Still other player accessible value input devices may require the use of touch keys on the touch screen display e.g. primary display and or secondary display or player input devices . Upon entry of player identification information and preferably secondary authorization information e.g. a password PIN number stored value card number predefined key sequences etc. the player may be permitted to access a player s account. As one potential optional security feature the handheld gaming machine may be configured to permit a player to only access an account the player has specifically set up for the handheld gaming machine . Other conventional security features may also be utilized to for example prevent unauthorized access to a player s account to minimize an impact of any unauthorized access to a player s account or to prevent unauthorized access to any personal information or funds temporarily stored on the handheld gaming machine .

The player accessible value input device may itself comprise or utilize a biometric player information reader which permits the player to access available funds on a player s account either alone or in combination with another of the aforementioned player accessible value input devices . In an embodiment wherein the player accessible value input device comprises a biometric player information reader transactions such as an input of value to the handheld device a transfer of value from one player account or source to an account associated with the handheld gaming machine or the execution of another transaction for example could all be authorized by a biometric reading which could comprise a plurality of biometric readings from the biometric device.

Alternatively to enhance security a transaction may be optionally enabled only by a two step process in which a secondary source confirms the identity indicated by a primary source. For example a player accessible value input device comprising a biometric player information reader may require a confirmatory entry from another biometric player information reader or from another source such as a credit card debit card player ID card fob key PIN number password hotel room key etc. Thus a transaction may be enabled by for example a combination of the personal identification input e.g. biometric input with a secret PIN number or a combination of a biometric input with a fob input or a combination of a fob input with a PIN number or a combination of a credit card input with a biometric input. Essentially any two independent sources of identity one of which is secure or personal to the player e.g. biometric readings PIN number password etc. could be utilized to provide enhanced security prior to the electronic transfer of any funds. In another aspect the value input device may be provided remotely from the handheld gaming machine .

The player input device comprises a plurality of push buttons on a button panel for operating the handheld gaming machine . In addition or alternatively the player input device may comprise a touch screen mounted to a primary display and or secondary display . In one aspect the touch screen is matched to a display screen having one or more selectable touch keys selectable by a user s touching of the associated area of the screen using a finger or a tool such as a stylus pointer. A player enables a desired function either by touching the touch screen at an appropriate touch key or by pressing an appropriate push button on the button panel. The touch keys may be used to implement the same functions as push buttons . Alternatively the push buttons may provide inputs for one aspect of the operating the game while the touch keys may allow for input needed for another aspect of the game. The various components of the handheld gaming machine may be connected directly to or contained within the casing as seen in or may be located outboard of the casing and connected to the casing via a variety of hardwired tethered or wireless connection methods. Thus the handheld gaming machine may comprise a single unit or a plurality of interconnected parts e.g. wireless connections which may be arranged to suit a player s preferences.

The operation of the basic wagering game on the handheld gaming machine is displayed to the player on the primary display . The primary display can also display the bonus game associated with the basic wagering game. The primary display preferably takes the form of a high resolution LCD a plasma display an LED or any other type of display suitable for use in the handheld gaming machine . The size of the primary display may vary from for example about a 2 3 display to a 15 or 17 display. In at least some aspects the primary display is a 7 10 display. As the weight of and or power requirements of such displays decreases with improvements in technology it is envisaged that the size of the primary display may be increased. Optionally coatings or removable films or sheets may be applied to the display to provide desired characteristics e.g. anti scratch anti glare bacterially resistant and anti microbial films etc. . In at least some embodiments the primary display and or secondary display may have a 16 9 aspect ratio or other aspect ratio e.g. 4 3 . The primary display and or secondary display may also each have different resolutions different color schemes and different aspect ratios.

As with the free standing gaming machine a player begins play of the basic wagering game on the handheld gaming machine by making a wager e.g. via the value input device or an assignment of credits stored on the handheld gaming machine via the touch screen keys player input device or buttons on the handheld gaming machine . In at least some aspects the basic game may comprise a plurality of symbols arranged in an array and includes at least one payline that indicates one or more outcomes of the basic game. Such outcomes are randomly selected in response to the wagering input by the player. At least one of the plurality of randomly selected outcomes may be a start bonus outcome which can include any variations of symbols or symbol combinations triggering a bonus game.

In some embodiments the player accessible value input device of the handheld gaming machine may double as a player information reader that allows for identification of a player by reading a card with information indicating the player s identity e.g. reading a player s credit card player ID card smart card etc. . The player information reader may alternatively or also comprise a bar code scanner RFID transceiver or computer readable storage medium interface. In one presently preferred aspect the player information reader shown by way of example in comprises a biometric sensing device.

Turning now to the various components of the gaming machine are controlled by a central processing unit CPU also referred to herein as a controller or processor such as a microcontroller or microprocessor . To provide gaming functions the controller executes one or more game programs stored in a computer readable storage medium in the form of memory . The controller performs the random selection using a random number generator RNG of an outcome from the plurality of possible outcomes of the wagering game. Alternatively the random event may be determined at a remote controller. The remote controller may use either an RNG or pooling scheme for its central determination of a game outcome. It should be appreciated that the controller may include one or more microprocessors including but not limited to a master processor a slave processor and a secondary or parallel processor.

The controller is also coupled to the system memory and a money credit detector . The system memory may comprise a volatile memory e.g. a random access memory RAM and a non volatile memory e.g. an EEPROM . The system memory may include multiple RAM and multiple program memories. The money credit detector signals the processor that money and or credits have been input via the value input device . Preferably these components are located within the housing of the gaming machine . However as explained above these components may be located outboard of the housing and connected to the remainder of the components of the gaming machine via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods.

As seen in the controller is also connected to and controls the primary display the player input device and a payoff mechanism . The payoff mechanism is operable in response to instructions from the controller to award a payoff to the player in response to certain winning outcomes that might occur in the basic game or the bonus game s . The payoff may be provided in the form of points bills tickets coupons cards etc. For example in the payoff mechanism includes both a ticket printer and a coin outlet . However any of a variety of payoff mechanisms well known in the art may be implemented including cards coins tickets smartcards cash etc. The payoff amounts distributed by the payoff mechanism are determined by one or more pay tables stored in the system memory .

Communications between the controller and both the peripheral components of the gaming machine and external systems occur through input output I O circuits . More specifically the controller controls and receives inputs from the peripheral components of the gaming machine through the input output circuits . Further the controller communicates with the external systems via the I O circuits and a communication path e.g. serial parallel IR RC 10bT etc. . The external systems may include a gaming network other gaming machines a gaming server communications hardware or a variety of other interfaced systems or components. Although the I O circuits may be shown as a single block it should be appreciated that each of the I O circuits may include a number of different types of I O circuits.

Controller as used herein comprises any combination of hardware software and or firmware that may be disposed or resident inside and or outside of the gaming machine that may communicate with and or control the transfer of data between the gaming machine and a bus another computer processor or device and or a service and or a network. The controller may comprise one or more controllers or processors. In the controller in the gaming machine is depicted as comprising a CPU but the controller may alternatively comprise a CPU in combination with other components such as the I O circuits and the system memory . The controller may reside partially or entirely inside or outside of the machine . The control system for a handheld gaming machine may be similar to the control system for the free standing gaming machine except that the functionality of the respective on board controllers may vary.

The gaming machines may communicate with external systems in a wired or wireless manner such that each machine operates as a thin client having relatively less functionality a thick client having relatively more functionality or through any range of functionality therebetween e.g. a rich client . As a generally thin client the gaming machine may operate primarily as a display device to display the results of gaming outcomes processed externally for example on a server as part of the external systems . In this thin client configuration the server executes game code and determines game outcomes e.g. with a random number generator while the controller on board the gaming machine processes display information to be displayed on the display s of the machine. In an alternative rich client configuration the server determines game outcomes while the controller on board the gaming machine executes game code and processes display information to be displayed on the display s of the machines. In yet another alternative thick client configuration the controller on board the gaming machine executes game code determines game outcomes and processes display information to be displayed on the display s of the machine. Numerous alternative configurations are possible such that the aforementioned and other functions may be performed onboard or external to the gaming machine as may be necessary for particular applications. It should be understood that the gaming machines may take on a wide variety of forms such as a free standing machine a portable or handheld device primarily used for gaming a mobile telecommunications device such as a mobile telephone or personal daily assistant PDA a counter top or bar top gaming machine or other personal electronic device such as a portable television MP3 player entertainment device etc.

Embodiments of the present concepts are described below with reference to . Generally the present concepts relate to a viewing feature e.g. a virtual camera implemented during a basic wagering game and or during a bonus game to provide a dynamic real time view. show an implementation of the viewing feature in a Monopoly themed 3 D bonus game wherein the viewing feature provides the player with a dynamic perspective of a gaming environment comprising a Monopoly board . In this example the dynamic perspective of the virtual camera is influenced by the real time actions of movable visual elements within the 3 D gaming environment.

As described in greater detail below the viewing feature operates in at least some aspects by tracking movable visual elements within the 3 D gaming environment and determining a position or determining a preferred position e.g. from one or more suitable positions from which to view all of the moveable visual elements or a selected subgroup thereof in relation to other objects in the 3 D gaming environment. Thus a view point or a point in space representing a viewing position moves through the 3 D gaming environment responsive to movement of one or more of the movable visual elements . As used herein the term 3 D gaming environment includes any type of 3 D representation but the illustrative examples provided herein relate particularly to 3 D perspective projection wherein three dimensional points are transformed via one or more transformation matrices for projection onto a view window of a two dimensional plane i.e. the view plane or view screen .

A gaming system in accord with the present concepts includes an input device for receiving a wager to play a wagering game and a primary display and or secondary display as previously noted. The gaming system also includes as will be appreciated from the examples of a controller e.g. configured to display on the display s and or or even an area display a three dimensional field of view representing the view from a point of view or virtual camera. This three dimensional field of view comprises a portion of or an entirety of a three dimensional gaming environment and one or more movable visual elements disposed within the three dimensional gaming environment. The examples of include a three dimensional gaming environment which comprises a board game e.g. a MONOPOLY themed game upon which the movable visual elements e.g. representations of people are disposed and move. In accord with aspects of the present concepts the controller e.g. of is configured to move the three dimensional field of view e.g. moving the point of view or virtual camera from one position in the three dimensional gaming environment to another position in the three dimensional gaming environment while retaining a selected movable visual elements or selected movable visual elements within the three dimensional field of view.

The gaming environment and moveable visual elements are generated in real time using a 3 D game engine e.g. game middleware and or 3 D engine e.g. graphics engine rendering engine such as but not limited to RenderWare developed and maintained by Criterion Software inclusive of any publicly available free or open source engines and commercial engines e.g. Unigine Power Render Dagor Engine 3 etc. or any other game engine currently existing or later developed . The concepts presented herein do not depend upon any particular application programming interface API . The term game engine is used herein for brevity to refer to both or either of a 3 D game engine and or a 3 D engine. The present concepts may also advantageously include a physics engine whether separately or as part of a game engine to realistically animate physical objects within the gaming environment.

Turning now to a basic game is implemented on the primary display . In this embodiment the basic game is a slot machine game with symbols on five different reels . The reels may be traditional mechanical reels electromechanical reels or computer generated images of reels or an array of computer generated images having the semblance of a reel with each reel having a plurality of symbols thereon and or each array position having a symbol thereon. In the illustrated embodiment there are multiple pay lines shown by the pay line indicators across the various reels . While multiple pay lines are shown a gaming terminal with a single pay line may also be used with the present concepts. An outcome indicator indicates whether the outcome has resulted in a payout a progressive jackpot a bonus game or whether it resulted in no reward at all.

In the illustrated example various combinations of symbols either along active pay lines or in predefined cell locations patterns or quantities may indicate prizes including monetary and non monetary prizes. The non monetary prizes include free spins multipliers entry into a bonus game entry into a progressive game or the like.

During the basic game of the illustrated embodiment of the player places a wager on any number of pay lines as denoted by the pay line indicators . For example in one embodiment the wager may be between one and five credits per pay line. However in other embodiments other wager amounts may be made. Once the player has input the wager and activated a spin reels button or the like the reels begin to spin. Likewise for a symbol array the symbols in the symbol array are caused by the controller to assume an intermediate state in which the symbol outcome for the array positions are visually indeterminable. As illustrated in near the bottom of the display are a plurality of keys that enable the player to perform various functions such as select the pay lines to play select a wager amount and spin the reels . Information relating to the spin outcome or symbol array outcome is displayed on one or more outcome indicators located above the keys . For example the outcome indicator may provide the player with information such as the amount of the current wager the amount awarded the total number of credits remaining and the like. Winning pay lines may be highlighted on the primary display .

In the illustrated example of the player has made a wager and the reels have spun or the symbol array resembling a reel has been updated to reflect the randomly determined outcome. In this embodiment a pay line corresponding with the pay line indicator traverses the top symbols of the reels . At the conclusion of the reel spin depicted in the pay line includes three GRAND HOTEL symbols creating a winning symbol combination. The player is awarded an initial basic game payout according to a basic game pay table as shown on the outcome indicator . The pay table for the basic game indicates the possible winning combinations of symbols and the initial payout associated with each winning combination prior to any bonus events. For line pays i.e. winning combinations that must appear on an active pay line the payout is typically but not necessarily multiplied by the number of credits wagered on the winning pay line. For scatter pays i.e. winning combinations that must appear on the display in a predetermined configuration but need not appear on an active pay line the payout may be multiplied by the total number of credits wagered.

In many traditional gaming machines the basic game concludes following the stopping of the reels the evaluation of the winning combinations and the payment of awards. Other gaming machines may award a bonus game during which the player may be awarded a bonus prize. A bonus game is triggered when a special start bonus outcome occurs in the basic game. The bonus game may be displayed on the primary display the secondary display or both. For example in a winning combination of three or more hotel related symbols appearing on an active pay line during the basic game triggers a bonus game.

In four trains are shown on the railroad stations i.e. READING RAILROAD PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD B O RAILROAD and SHORT LINE RAILROAD respectively . The player is then prompted to select one of the trains to determine the number of moveable visual elements that will populate the gaming environment. Each of the trains is randomly associated with either a predetermined number of moveable visual elements shown by way of example in or a random number of such moveable visual elements. Following selection of one of the trains the selected train train as shown is optionally highlighted and the moveable visual elements are shown see .

As shown in the example of the moveable visual elements comprise people moving out of the train and onto the central portion of the game board . Alternatively the moveable visual elements may be disposed outside of the game board or in some relation to the game board or other gaming environment other than that depicted. In the camera is positioned to include all of the movable visual elements and substantially the entire game board within the view frustrum. In this example at least initially the view point of the camera will be centered about the center point of all position vectors of the movable visual elements . In this manner all of the movable visual elements will remain within the field of view of the camera at all times.

The moveable visual elements e.g. people may look alike or may embody various unique appearances attributes behaviors and or characteristics. Where provided such unique appearances attributes behaviors and or characteristics may optionally denote a particular predilection for certain properties or outcomes. For example moveable visual elements provided to have the appearance of a Rich Couple such as shown in may optionally have a greater probability of being associated with a higher value winning outcome in the bonus game than a Salesman. 

On the left side of the screen shown in a highlighted 12 is shown above ST. CHARLES PLACE which indicates that a virtual person not shown has just occupied or engaged that station . Following the occupation of the station the virtual person not shown disappears and is replaced by the bonus award for that station. In this example ST. CHARLES PLACE has a base value of 7 credits similar to STATES AVENUE and VIRGINIA AVENUE. However since ST. CHARLES PLACE has a house on the station the base value is increased to 12 credits. Similarly it can be seen in this example that VERMONT AVENUE TENNESSEE AVENUE PACIFIC AVENUE and NORTH CAROLINA AVENUE also have houses and carry with them enhanced bonus values of 10 credits 15 credits 30 credits and 30 credits respectively as compared to the displayed base values of the related stations of 5 credits 7 credits 15 credits and 15 credits respectively.

In the view point of the camera remains centered about the center point of all position vectors of the movable visual elements so that all of the movable visual elements will remain within the field of view of the camera at all times. However in this screen shot the camera has been moved to a different view point than that represented in .

In the view point of the camera is no longer centered about the center point of all position vectors of the movable visual elements . Instead the view point of the camera is centered about the center point of position vectors for a subset of movable visual elements here the Rich Couple. Accordingly this subset will remain within the center of the field of view of the camera.

In at least some aspects the three dimensional field of view comprises a dynamic point of view or camera positioned by the controller e.g. of to maintain a set of static objects such as portions of the board game and dynamic objects such as the movable visual elements in the view frustrum or view volume of the camera. The position of each dynamic object within the three dimensional gaming environment is defined at any given point in time by a direction vector having a magnitude and directional components of a defined reference frame or coordinate system e.g. cartesian polar spherical etc. . In at least some aspects the defined reference frame and coordinate system may be centered with respect to an arbitrarily disposed center point or origin in the three dimensional gaming environment such as but not limited to a center point or corner of the board game in the depicted example. The position of each movable visual element is then accordingly defined by a vector from the origin to the movable visual element. In at least some other aspects the defined reference frame or coordinate system may be centered with respect to the view point or camera wherein for example the position of each movable visual element is defined by a vector from the view point or camera to the movable visual element. Alternatively a plurality of reference frames may be selected and utilized to simplify and or speed processing speed.

Regardless of the selected reference frame conversions of the vector equations from one reference frame to another reference frame may be accomplished using a transformation matrix in a manner well known to those having ordinary skill in the art. For example transformation of a vector e.g. A iA jA kA from a first reference frame into a second reference frame e.g. A i A j A k A would be handled by such a transformation matrix. Conventional transformation matrices and vector algebra may accordingly be used in a situation utilizing a fixed origin to effect rotation scaling shearing reflection and or orthogonal projection.

A first step in transforming the coordinates of each point of a given movable visual element typically but not necessarily comprises representing the position and orientation of each point of the movable visual element. Each point is a set of three numbers e.g. x y z coordinates from an origin an origin of the object or movable visual element that the points belong to . In addition the object or movable visual element has three coordinates and a rotation e.g. describing its position and orientation relative to a gaming environment or world reference frame. Separate transformation matrices may separately handle translation rotation about the x axis rotation about the y axis and rotation about the z axis the product of these matrices yielding a gaming environment matrix which may further be multiplied by a scaling transformation matrix such as 

The next act is substantially identical to the above act but uses the coordinates of the observer instead of the coordinates of a point of an object and the inverses of the matrices e.g. inverse object translation inverse rotation about the x axis inverse rotation about the y axis inverse rotation about the z axis should be used multiplied in the opposite order. The resulting transformation matrix can transform coordinates from the gaming environment reference frame to the camera s reference frame. In at least some aspects the camera reference frame looks along its z axis the x axis is left and the y axis is up. The aforementioned transformation matrices can be multiplied to yield a matrix able to transform a point s coordinates from an object s reference frame to the camera s reference frame.

Subsequently to provide a realistic rendering the coordinates are further transformed to provide a perspective simulating perspective distortion and permitting the camera to provide a view that will enable a viewer to judge distances in the simulated view. The perspective distortion may be generated for example using the following 4 4 matrix 

The above noted transformation matrices can be multiplied together to get a final transformation matrix to which a vector defining each of point can be multiplied to directly obtain the screen coordinate at which the point must be drawn to provide the desired camera view. The vector is extended to four dimensions using homogenous coordinates 

In accord with the present concepts a center point of the movable visual elements is calculated at a given point in time by the average of the positions of all points in the set of movable visual elements. For example the directional vectors of all points comprising the movable visual elements are averaged to yield a center point of such vectors. Alternatively the present concepts may comprise calculation of an intermediate point between a plurality of selected points such intermediate point encompassing within a desired point of view predetermined selected points. The aforementioned center point may comprise points defining all movable visual elements or may include only those points defining movable visual elements disposed within a field of view or view volume of the camera at that point in time. The view volumes planes which make up the view volume or view frustrum i.e. volume defined by 6 planes in space including front and back planes are then defined using this center point. In various aspects the center point serves as a center point of the view frustrum is maintained near a center point of the view frustrum or is disposed elsewhere within the view frustrum.

Once the center point and associated center point vector of the movable visual elements is determined the camera may be transformed via a transformation matrix to this position represented by the vector. Also the movable visual elements e.g. the moving 3D objects in the gaming environment may be transformed from their own local coordinate system into a world coordinate system via the transformation matrix that defines the position and orientation of the movable visual elements is the world space. The movable visual elements are also transformed into the camera coordinate system so that their position and orientation are relative to the camera s position and orientation.

The controller is configured to move the camera backwards or forwards along the z axis as necessary to retain all of the desired movable visual elements within the view volume. The camera is thus configured for example to translate along a line defined by the center point of the set of objects and a direction vector e.g. a camera lookAt vector . The forward and backward movement of the camera in particular permits zooming to focus on a small set of movable visual elements e.g. one virtual person moving within the gaming environment . The camera also has angle parameters which can also be changed at any time.

Dynamic objects such as the movable visual elements and static objects such as the aforementioned game board in the gaming environment are further defined by a position in space and a bounding volume e.g. a bounding sphere bounding polygon bounding planes . If any portion of the bounding volume is determined to lie within a viewing volume at a given instant in time the object can then be designated for rendering in whole or in part or alternatively the object can for such instant be removed from the camera movement algorithm CMA e.g. removed from a CMA watch list .

As noted above the gaming machine according to the present invention generates 3 D effects in real time with a 3 D engine providing a visually rich environment for the gaming player. In accord with the above concepts at each time step the controller controlling the calculations for determination of the appropriate view of the gaming environment from the camera calculates the needed position to capture the desired dynamic elements e.g. movable visual elements and static elements e.g. game board in the view frustrum.

The movement of the camera between a point at a first instant of time to encompass a first set of movable visual elements and static elements in the view frustrum and a second instant of time to encompass a second set of movable visual elements and static elements in the view frustrum may advantageously be softened utilizing a linear or non linear video or motion smoothing function. Any conventional motion smoothing function could be employed to the aforementioned movement of the camera between a first point and a second point. The smoothing function may for example provide limits on and or control acceleration deceleration and or velocity of the camera as it travels between a first point at a first point in time and a second point at a second point in time. Likewise the smoothing function may provide limits on and or control rates of angular movement of the camera e.g. panning tilting along one or more axes and or limits on depthwise movement of the field of view e.g. focusing as it travels between a first point at a first point in time and a second point at a second point in time. Conventional smoothing function methods including using curves exponential decay functions and damped springs. Curve methods might include using a part of a sine wave as the dampening factor. Common exponential decay functions may use a current position a desired position a scalar and a time delta to derive a new smoothed position. Damped springs used for smoothing may utilize Hooke s law to represent the spring and consider variables of forces spring lengths velocities points of mass and constants to model the spring.

In accord with the above concepts the list of the set of movable visual elements may be changed at any time without significant disruption to the view point or view frustrum since the view frustrum is advantageously centered about or includes a center point of a selected set e.g. all some etc. of the movable visual elements calculated at a given point in time by the average of all points e.g. directional vectors in the set of movable visual elements. This centering of the view frustrum allows movable visual elements to enter exit the gaming environment without causing significant jumps in camera movement as is described above with reference to certain of . For example when one of the movable visual elements vanishes off of the left side of the game board at the ST. CHARLES PLACE station as shown in the camera which is positioned to include all of the movable visual elements within the view frustrum does not require a significant shift in the view point to reorient the view point responsive to the change in the center point of the remaining movable visual elements.

The 3 D views of the gaming environment of the present concepts are displayed in real time on the display . In a real time determination and display embodiment game activity is shown on the display at substantially the same time that the underlying mathematical basis for the displayed game activity is being calculated e.g. rendering on the fly . The 3 D real time views of the present concepts display at least a portion of the game board from different view points. The view points may be shown at different distances camera angles combinations thereof or the like.

Referring back to for example the first view shows a broad distant view the game board during which the camera is generally aimed in the direction of Arrow A. The second view shows a closer up or zoomed in view of an element of the game board PACIFIC AVENUE in which the camera is generally aimed in the direction of Arrow B. Displaying elements of the wagering game from various distances and or camera angles allows a player to simultaneously maintain a broad view of the game as well as perceive more detail regarding the game activity. Thus this feature allows for a more realistic interactive view of the elements and thereby increases the anticipation and excitement experienced by the player.

Although in the illustrated embodiments the 3 D real time displays are shown during the bonus game it is contemplated that the present concepts may also be used during a basic game or both the basic game and a bonus game. Furthermore although the basic game of the illustrated embodiment is a slot machine game the present concepts may also be used with other types of wagering games including for example video poker video roulette video keno and the like. The gaming environment various views of elements as described herein may include symbols a location of a path or the like that is used to indicate a randomly selected outcome.

Although the movable visual elements above related to non player controlled virtual people the movable visual elements may also or alternatively comprise player controlled elements. Such player controlled elements may comprise for example but are not limited to game tokens e.g. MONOPOLY tokens such as a car dog horse shoe hat etc. moving about the game board or game pieces or player controlled virtual people moved about a gaming environment.

Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed concepts which is set forth in the following claims. For example although determination of a center point of the movable visual elements has been disclosed other vectors may also be advantageously used to control or influence camera movement. A velocity vector of one or more movable visual elements may also be used in combination with a motion smoothing function to control movement of the camera between a first point at a first point in time and a second point at a subsequent time. In one aspect the acceleration and or velocity of the camera may be set to substantially match the velocity of the movable visible element . In yet other aspects the repositioning of the camera to the second point to provide a second three dimensional view of one or more movable visual elements from a second view point may precede or follow a movement of the one or more movable visual elements or may occur simultaneously with a movement of the one or more movable visual elements.

Still further for purposes of calculating a center of the movable visual elements and an associated view frustrum including a desired set of such movable visual elements the movable visual elements may be assigned varying weights or levels of importance to skew the calculated center in accord with such weighting.

Additionally since the present concepts are applied to a wagering game where at some point prior to display of or the revealing of an outcome all of the outcomes are pre determined or known to the controller e.g. in advance the controller may be advantageously configured to determine in advance of the display of a particular outcome an appropriate camera view for one or more subsequent times. For example a controller may determine the appropriate camera view for a first time e.g. T an immediately subsequent second time e.g. T and indeed at any and all points in time through completion of a game feature through a last time e.g. T . Thus the controller e.g. may using pre determined random outcomes compute in advance either prior to a game feature and or during a game feature a camera position set s of movable elements and characteristics thereof e.g. position directional vectors movement etc. and determine an associated view frustrum based on selected parameters for one or more time increments.
