The present invention relates to the new and distinct Threadleaf Coreopsis herein also referred to as Sunbeam by the cultivar name Sunbeam or as the Plant. Sunbeam was discovered by Ronald L. Walters in the summer of 2002 as an uninduced whole plant mutation of Coreopsis Moonbeam not patented in the fields of a wholesale perennial grower in Zeeland Mich. USA. It was then isolated and compared in subsequent years to other coreopsis and found to be different from all cultivars known to the discoverer.

Asexual propagation at the same nursery in Zeeland Mich. USA by cuttings has shown Sunbeam to be stable and reproduce true to type in successive generations.

The Plant has not been observed in all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary slightly with changes in environments such as light intensity fertility water availability etc. without however any variation in genotype.

Plants of Sunbeam are shorter in habit than Golden Showers not patented and taller than Zagreb not patented . Flowers of Sunbeam are smaller with entire margins on ray petals and the flowers are above the foliage compared to Cr me Brut e U.S. Plant Pat. No. 16 096 which hare larger flowers held at the foliage level and incised ray petal apices. The ray petal color of Sunbeam is slightly darker yellow than Crm me Brul e .

The following description is based on a two year old plant growing in a full sun trial garden in Zeeland Mich. USA. For the growing season up to the time of description the daytime temperatures range between 12 30 C. and night temperatures range between 6 19 C. Except for ordinary dictionary color usage color references are according to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart 2001 edition.
