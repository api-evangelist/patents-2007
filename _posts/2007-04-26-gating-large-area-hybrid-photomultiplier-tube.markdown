In addition to the semiconductor device the collecting anode may also include a coaxial feedthrough with a step tapered central transmission line section disposed through the axial center of the coaxial feedthrough . The coaxial feedthrough may be in electronic communication with the semiconductor device . The coaxial feedthrough may be attached to a cable not shown which can transmit any type of electrical signal. The signal may be transmitted to processor computer or any type of acceptor of signals. The central transmission line section may have a circular cross section. The collecting anode may also include a ceramic isolator and an external conductor . The ceramic isolator may be in the shape of an axially extended annulus with a lid or closed end top portion and partially envelop or slip over the coaxial feedthrough . The external conductor may be ring or washer like in shape and the inner diameter of the external conductor may be in communication with the outer diameter of the ceramic isolator . In the preferred embodiment the external conductor includes a flange portion a main portion and a lip portion . The flange portion may be disposed at or near the outer diameter of the external conductor and substantially perpendicular to the main portion . The main portion extends away from the flange portion toward the lip portion . The flange portion may in be communication with the ceramic isolator . The semiconductor device may be mounted on the ceramic isolator preferably on the closed end top portion of the ceramic isolator . In the preferred embodiment the semiconductor device is a solid state photodiode. The preferred photodiode is a Schottky diode or p i n diode. The electron incident surface may electrically communicate with the external conductor particularly the main portion of the external conductor via a thin conductor .

The gating grid may be a metal grid arranged close to the inner surface of the photocathode . The inner surface of the photocathode is the edge or surface that is facing into the interior or inside of the envelope . The gating grid may correspond to the inner diameter of the envelope or be sized such that an entire cross sectional area of the envelope is covered by the gating grid . The gating grid may be connected to an external power supply through a related conductor or conductors. The related conductor s may be ring like and disposed on the outer edge or outer diameter of the gating grid . In another embodiment of the invention the gating grid may be deposited on the inner surface of the photocathode and isolated from the photocathode by a dielectric layer.

The electron optical system may include focusing electrodes formed as cylindrical rings mounted between isolation rings . The electron optical system may be connected to an external power supply. The cylindrical rings focus and direct the photoelectrons generated by the photocathode onto the collecting anode specifically the electron incident surface . The photomultiplier may also include a isolation ring disposed between the photocathode and the gating grid .

The ion target may be disposed at about the center of the gating grid . In one of the embodiments of the invention the ion target is a solid metal plate welded to the gating grid . As shown in the envelope the gating grid and the ion target may have a circular cross section and may be axially aligned. The gating grid may be a metal grid with gating grid cells that is welded inside the related conductor which may be a metal ring conductor . In the preferred embodiment of the invention the gating grid cells are square shaped. In another embodiment of the invention as shown in the ion target may be a metal grid with ion target cells . In the preferred embodiment of the invention the ion target cells are square shaped and the size of the individual squares or ion target cells of the ion target is smaller than the size of the individual squares or gating grid cells of the gating grid . In the preferred embodiment of the invention the size of the ion target conductive area is the size of about 1 to about 5 of the size of the photocathode surface area.

The photomultiplier tube may also include an ion trap electrode . The ion trap electrode may be disposed between one of the cylindrical rings of the electron optical system and the collecting anode . The ion trap electrode may be formed by pressing a stainless steel plate or may be integrated with a welded flange portion and have a cone a cylinder shape or any other shape practicable. There may be another isolation ring disposed between the ion trap electrode and the collecting anode .

In operation an accelerate voltage on the order of about 8 10 kV is typically applied between the photocathode and the external conductor . The bias voltage on the order of several volts is applied to the semiconductor device between the external conductor and the coaxial feedthrough . Electrons are accelerated by the applied field and bombard the electron incident surface of the semiconductor device . As a result of bombarding the electron incident surface or photodiode by electrons which are accelerated and focused on the electron incident surface the electrons multiply and the photodiode s bias current provides an increased output signal of the hybrid photomultiplier tube .

The cylindrical rings are applied with a predetermined voltage from the external voltage source not shown . Typically voltage applied to one of the cylindrical rings consists about 80 98 and voltage to another cylindrical ring consists about 60 90 from voltage applied between the photocathode and the semiconductor device ground . The ion trap electrode is applied with a predetermined voltage which is negative relative to the semiconductor device voltage typically from about 50 to about 350 volts.

Negative relative semiconductor device voltage applied to the ion trap electrode creates a braking electric field for electrons bombarding the ion trap electrode and typically the energy of bombarding electrons is not enough for ionization from the ion trap electrode surface. Therefore negative voltage applied to the ion trap electrode prevents generation of positive ions on the ion trap electrode surface and provides a long time of operating and improves noise factor. Same time negative voltage applied to the ion trap electrode and voltage applied to the electron optical system are creating an electric lens for focusing positive ions generated from the collecting anode to the ion target . The ion target and the gating grid are set at the same negative potential relative to the semiconductor device . Positive ions generated on the electron incident surface of semiconductor device will pass by the electron optical system and are collected by the ion target . Therefore negative potential applied to the ion target pulls positive ions and prevents photocathode bombardment and damage by positive ions generated on the electron incident surface of semiconductor device and provides a long time of operating.

Negative voltage applied to the gating grid pulls positive ions and prevents photocathode damage by positive ions generated inside the photomultiplier volume by residual gases ionization. It prevents damage to the photocathode and provides a long time of operating and improves noise factor too.

The gating grid disposed close to the inner surface of the photocathode provides much smaller time of gate operation a few ns for said regimes and high repetition rate and allows work with short time light pulses. Therefore the gating grid allows using the photocathode for a very short time of useful input signal receiving and prolonging time of operation. The gating grid is a defense of the photocathode from water surface reflected laser and sun beams.
