title: Die mounting stress isolator
abstract: One method of the present invention includes preparing a die with traces and pads as desired for the intended use of the die. A MEMS device is mounted to the die. The die is then mounted to a substrate of the same material as the die. The substrate is then mounted to a package. The die and/or the substrate may be flip-chip mounted.

The invention described herein was made in the performance of work Under U.S. Government Contract No. DAAE30 01 9 0100. The Government Agency is U.S. Army TACOM ARDEC. The Government may have rights to portions of this invention.

Microelectromechanical systems MEMS devices or computer chips are often mounted on dies. Stresses due to die mounting can affect the performance of MEMS devices. The stresses change with temperature because of the differing coefficients of thermal expansion CTE of the package and the die dies made of silicon or borosilicate glass typically have a lower CTE than that of the package so as temperature changes the package stresses the die. Thus as shown in a die with a lower CTE than a package are heated when attaching the die to the package . When the assembly cools the package experiences more shrinkage than the die and creates stress at attachment points . The stress affects the performance of the MEMS device .

The stresses also change due to shock when wire bonds change shape which causes problems for capacitive sensors that require stable geometry for stable output. Additionally making wire bonds at the package level makes the parts more expensive because each part must be handled separately as well as increasing the chance of damage to the assembly.

The present invention provides a system and method of reducing the stress associated with a die mount as well as eliminating the wire bonding operation.

In an example embodiment a die is prepared with traces and pads as desired for the intended use of the die. A MEMS device is mounted to the die. The die is then mounted to a substrate of the same material as the die. The substrate is then mounted to a package.

With reference to a device according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. A MEMS device which may be an accelerometer a gyroscope or any other suitable MEMS device is mounted to a rectangular block die during the MEMS build. The die is mounted to a rectangular block cover plate via gold bumps which can be approximately 0.001 to 0.005 in diameter and the die can be flip chip mounted to the cover plate . The gold bumps provide all of the structural strength necessary to prevent dislodging the die during use. The MEMS device can be protected from contact during flip chip mounting using etched features or process controls. The cover plate is mounted to a package a rectangular block including a recess or wirebond shelf with a step sized and shaped to receive the MEMS device the die and the cover plate . The cover plate is mounted to the step of the package via gold bumps and the cover plate can be flip chip mounted to the package . The package can be a Leadless Ceramic Chip Carrier LCCC . Electrically conductive traces from the MEMS device to the gold bumps and conductive traces from the gold bumps to the gold bumps provide a connection between the MEMS device and the package so that the MEMS device can be in electrical contact with devices or systems not shown outside the package as necessary depending on the intended use of the device .

The die has a preselected CTE and the package has a preselected CTE that is higher than the CTE of the die . The cover plate is preferably made of the same material as the die with the same CTE as the die . Alternatively the cover plate is made of a different material than the die as long as the CTE of the cover plate has an intermediate CTE higher than the CTE of the die and lower than the CTE of the package and preferably the CTE of the cover plate is closer to the CTE of the die than the package .

Note that the electrically conductive traces electrically connect the MEMS device to the package. The traces are mechanically more stable under shock than wirebonds because they are printed on the package and cover plate.

While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described as noted above many changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example the embodiments disclosed use gold bumps but solder balls conductive polymers or directional conductors may be used instead. Accordingly the scope of the invention is not limited by the disclosure of the preferred embodiment. Instead the invention should be determined entirely by reference to the claims that follow.
