title: Move-away arrow rest
abstract: An arrow rest that moves away from a shaft, such as an arrow shaft or a bolt shaft, when the shaft is discharged from a bow, such as an archery bow or a crossbow. An actuator moves between the load position and the discharge position. During movement of the actuator, one or more arms supporting and/or guiding the shaft move away from the shaft, such as to provide clearance for the shaft and/or any corresponding vanes, fletching and/or steering devices.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 881 071 filed 17 Jan. 2007 the disclosure of which earlier application is incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof including but not limited to those portions which specifically appear in this application.

This invention relates to an arrow rest that supports a loaded arrow shaft and then moves away from a launched arrow shaft to provide clearance for the arrow shaft and corresponding fletching vanes or other steering devices.

Conventional arrow rests have mechanisms that allow limbs or other resting surfaces to drop away or otherwise move away from an arrow shaft when launched from an archery bow to provide clearance for fletching vanes or other steering devices.

Some conventional arrow rests have pivotally mounted support elements that move away from the arrow shaft upon discharge of the arrow. Springs are used to urge the support element towards an unloaded or discharged position. Flexible inelastic members have been used to overcome the spring force that urges the support element toward the unloaded position.

Other conventional arrow rests have both lower support arms and upper support arms to maintain the arrow shaft in a loaded ready to launch position.

Other conventional arrow rests have fall away or drop away arrow rests some with fixed upper arms to prevent the arrow shaft from falling out of a loaded position such as when the archery bow is tilted or moved out of a shooting position.

Other conventional arrow rests use an arrow rest arm to engage and support the arrow shaft when an archery bow is in a cocked position. A known detector assembly can detect movement of the bow away from the cocked position towards a released position and in response can move a cam assembly that then moves the arrow rest laterally away from the arrow.

There is an apparent need for an arrow rest that can be used to hold an arrow shaft in a mounted position even when a bow is tilted or otherwise moved to prevent the arrow shaft from falling away from a mounted position on the arrow rest particularly where arrow support members move away from each other and the arrow shaft during discharge or launching of the arrow.

One object of this invention is to provide an arrow rest that has arms which move away from the arrow shaft upon launching or discharge of the arrow shaft such as away from an archery bow and or a crossbow.

The above and other objects of this invention are accomplished with an arrow rest that moves between a load position and a discharge position. In the load position one or more arms each supports the arrow shaft when in the load position and also moves away from the arrow shaft when the arrow rest moves from the load position to the discharge position.

At least one arm is positioned adjacent over or otherwise next to the arrow shaft with or without contact to prevent the arrow shaft from falling away from the at least one support arm such as when an archery bow or a crossbow is tilted or otherwise moved.

In certain embodiments of this invention an actuator can be moved in response to a detected signal and or a mechanical or electromechanical engagement with an input source such as a hammer or a pushrod. Upon experiencing or sensing discharge of the arrow shaft the actuator can be moved with respect to an archery bow and or the arrow shaft when in the at rest or load position. Many different mechanical devices and or electromechanical devices can be used to move the actuator.

Upon actuation the actuator can cause the arms to move away from each other for example to clear the discharged arrow shaft and or the fletching vanes or other steering device.

The particular shape size rigidity and materials of each arm can be designed to accommodate one or more purposes associated with holding and or launching a shaft with respect to a bow.

In certain embodiments of this invention each arm is normally biased into the discharge position where the arm is moved far enough away to provide clearance for the shaft and or the fletching the vanes and or another steering device. When the actuator is in the load position in certain embodiments of this invention the actuator interferes with one or more arms to prevent the corresponding arm from moving into the discharge position.

The actuator can have one or more of many different designs shapes sizes and or components. In some embodiments of this invention the actuator is slidably mounted with respect to the archery bow. Each arm is connected to or integrated with a rotatable body that rotates or pivots to move each arm away from the arrow shaft.

Any suitable bias element such as a coil spring a leaf spring a compression spring a tension spring and or any other suitable mechanical element having a bias force can be used to normally urge one or more components of this invention into the load position and or the discharge position. The bias elements can be sized shaped and otherwise designed to accomplish a desired force direction and or magnitude.

This invention is directed to arrow rest such as shown in that moves away from shaft when shaft is discharged from bow . U.S. Pat. No. 6 782 881 describes a move away arrow rest that operates between a loaded position and an unloaded position. Many features and elements taught by U.S. Pat. No. 6 782 881 relate to corresponding features and elements of this invention. The entire teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6 782 881 are incorporated into this specification by reference to U.S. Pat. No. 6 782 881.

As shown in shaft moves from right to left when discharged in forward direction as shown in . Although the following specification primarily discusses bow as an archery bow arrow rest can be used in combination with any other archery bow crossbow or other similar discharge device. Likewise shaft is primarily described as an arrow shaft but can comprise any other suitable archery shaft bolt shaft such as used with a crossbow or shaft of any other suitable projectile.

Arrow rest is moveable between a load position such as shown in and a discharge position in which two or more support arms are moved away from each other. Arrow rest of this invention preferably moves far enough away and fast enough to clear any fletching vanes or other steering device connected to attached to or otherwise associated with shaft .

In certain embodiments of this invention arrow rest comprises body attachable to bow . Any threaded connection open bore closed bore and or other mechanical connector can be used to removably and or securely attach body with respect to bow . Preferably but not necessarily when attached body is in a fixed position with respect to bow .

As shown in and arrow rest comprises arm and arm each positioned on opposite sides of shaft such as shown in . When in the load position shaft applies a downward force to and also rests upon arm particularly when bow is in an upright and or use position. Arm may or may not contact shaft when in the load position. Arm can be used to retain or otherwise hold shaft in the load position even when bow is tilted or otherwise moved out of the shooting position. For example each of arm and arm can be used to retain shaft in a mounted position on arrow rest such as when an archer is carrying bow in the field.

Arm and or arm each is moveably mounted with respect to body . As shown in arm and or arm can pivot or rotate with respect to body . In other embodiments of this invention arm and or arm can otherwise be configured to mechanically move with respect to body . When moving from the load position to the discharge position arm preferably moves away from arm for example to provide clearance for shaft and or any associated fletching vanes and or other steering device.

As shown in for example bias element can be used to urge arm in a first radial direction such as away from shaft . Likewise bias element can be used to urge arm in a second radial direction which is preferably different than the first radial direction and also away from shaft . In other embodiments of this invention for example as shown in arm and or arm can slidably move with respect to each other and or body with or without rotational movement with respect to each other and or body . If arm and or arm is moveably mounted in other than a rotating or pivoting manner such as in a sliding manner or another manner bias element and or bias element can be differently configured. For example as shown in arm and or arm can be slidably mounted with respect to body .

In some embodiments of this invention bias element and or bias element each comprises a spring such as a coil spring. As shown in end of bias element can be fixed with respect to body and end of bias element can be fixed with respect to cam element and or arm . Likewise end of bias element can be fixed with respect to body and end of bias element can be fixed with respect to cam element and or arm . With this type of a configuration bias element and or bias element can normally urge or force arm and or arm into the discharge position in which arm is moved away from arm and or shaft to provide any necessary clearance.

As shown by the partial cross sectional view of arrow rest in for example bias element and bias element and or bias element each is mounted about a pivot axis of at least one of arm and arm . Any other suitable configuration of arm arm bias element and or bias element can be used to accomplish the same result of moving arm away from arm such as when arrow rest moves from the load position to the discharge position. For example any suitable bias element and or bias element can be mounted or positioned with respect to body such as shown in to move arm and or arm .

As shown in and actuator is moveably mounted with respect to body . As shown in actuator comprises a pin slidably mounted with respect to body . Actuator may comprise a sear shaft a rod and or any other magnetic mechanical and or electromechanical element used to move actuator with respect to body . In the load position such as shown in actuator maintains a position of arm and or arm with respect to body and with respect to each other. As shown in in the load position projections of actuator interfere with rotational or pivotal movement of arm and or arm . As shown in and for example arm is attached to or integrated with cam element . Likewise arm is attached to or integrated with cam . Cam element and or cam can comprise a disk or any other suitably shaped body that can rotate pivot or otherwise move with respect to body . As shown in bias element has end connected directly to cam element and bias element has end connected directly to cam . When actuator is moved to the right as shown in projections of actuator move far enough to no longer interfere with cam and or cam . As shown in when actuator is moved far enough to the right bias element and bias element urge arm and arm respectively apart or away from each other to provide any necessary clearance.

Actuator can have any suitably designed projection and or other element to release or prevent interference of actuator with arm and or arm . For example actuator can comprise an elongated member such as the rods shown in that slidably move with respect to body when actuated or that are fixed with respect to body but allow arm and or arm to slide or otherwise move with respect to body . In other embodiments according to this invention actuator may comprise another magnetic and or electromechanical actuating device.

As shown in bias element urges actuator into the load position such as where each projection interferes with cam element or cam element . In some embodiments according to this invention bias element is mounted between body and actuator such as shown in . Hammer is moveably mounted with respect to body and or actuator . As shown in hammer is pivotally mounted and normally biased into a position where hammer does not contact actuator . shows bias element such as a coil spring mounted to urge hammer into the non contact position shown in .

Any suitable force can be applied to hammer or another similar mechanical element to transfer an actuation force to actuator . In some embodiments according to this invention a string cord or other member can be used to connect hammer to a cable of bow such as a cable for a compound archery bow. When attached to a cable of a compound archery bow as shaft moves from the load position to the discharge position the cable cord or other member attached between the cable and hammer can be released such as when releasing a bow string to overcome the force of bias element and thus contact actuator with enough force to move actuator to the discharge position and thereby cause arm to move away from arm . Any other suitable mechanical magnetic and or electromechanical device can be used to move actuator arm and or arm .

The two lines identified with element reference numeral as shown in represent a plane that is positioned generally perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of shaft . In certain embodiments of this invention during movement from the load position to the discharge position at least one of arm and arm pivots or otherwise moves within or generally within plane . shows arm and arm pivoting about the same general axis. However arm and arm can pivot about different axes.

In some embodiments of this invention bias element bias element bias element and or bias element can be sized designed or otherwise selected to accommodate different movements of arm with respect to arm . Actuator can be designed to move arm and arm simultaneously apart from each other or apart from each other with a time delay.

Arm and or arm can be of a rigid material and or a flexible material. Whichever arm supports the gravity weight of shaft can be relatively rigid or stiffer than the other arm for example to better hold or support shaft .

The elements of this invention can be constructed of any suitable metal material non metal material and or composite material. Body preferably but not necessarily provides a complete enclosure for any one or more elements housed within body .

While in the foregoing specification this invention has been described in relation to certain preferred embodiments and many details are set forth for purpose of illustration it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that this invention is susceptible to additional embodiments and that certain of the details described in this specification and in the claims can be varied considerably without departing from the basic principles of this invention.
