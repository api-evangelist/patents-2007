This invention provides nuclear hormone receptor binding compounds and uses thereof in treating a variety of diseases or conditions in a subject including inter alia prostate cancer and or diseases or disorders of bone and muscle.

The nuclear hormone receptor superfamily is one of the largest classes of transcription factors and is involved in abundant physiological processes. The 48 members of this family are divided into three classes with class 1 comprised of receptors for androgens AR estrogens ER and ER glucocorticoids GR progesterone PR and mineralocorticoids MR . Class 2 contains receptors for retinoids thyroids and vitamin D while class 3 includes receptors for which ligands are yet to be identified orphans . Nuclear hormone receptors have an N terminal domain NTD whose function is less characterized a DNA binding domain DBD which is responsible for the binding of receptor to DNA response elements a hinge region that contains the nuclear localization signal and a ligand binding domain LBD to which ligands bind and activate or inhibit receptor action. In addition there are two activation function domains one in the NTD AF 1 and the other in the LBD AF 2 . Due to the high amino acid sequence homology of the DBD moderate homology and similar secondary and tertiary structural features of the LBD and common chemical features of steroidal ligands class I receptors are often capable of binding i.e. cross reacting with the ligands of other class I receptors. For example early studies with AR and ER suggest that the orientation of the steroid in the LBD with the steroid A ring in contact with helix 3 and the D ring in contact with helix 11 residues is likely to be general for all the steroid hormone receptors.

The androgen receptor AR is a ligand activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with endogenous androgens. Androgens are generally known as the male sex hormones. The androgenic hormones are steroids which are produced in the body by the testes and the cortex of the adrenal gland or can be synthesized in the laboratory. Androgenic steroids play an important role in many physiologic processes including the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics such as muscle and bone mass prostate growth spermatogenesis and the male hair pattern Matsumoto Endocrinol. Met. Clin. N. Am. 23 857 75 1994 . The endogenous steroidal androgens include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone DHT . Testosterone is the principal steroid secreted by the testes and is the primary circulating androgen found in the plasma of males. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha reductase in many peripheral tissues. DHT is thus thought to serve as the intracellular mediator for most androgen actions Zhou et al. Molec. Endocrinol. 9 208 18 1995 . Other steroidal androgens include esters of testosterone such as the cypionate propionate phenylpropionate cyclopentylpropionate isocarporate enanthate and decanoate esters and other synthetic androgens such as 7 Methyl Nortestosterone MENT and its acetate ester Sundaram et al. 7 Alpha Methyl Nortestosterone MENT The Optimal Androgen For Male Contraception Ann. Med. 25 199 205 1993 Sundaram . Because the AR is involved in male sexual development and function the AR is a likely target for effecting male contraception or other forms of hormone replacement therapy.

The human progesterone receptor PR occurs as three different isoforms PR A PR B and PR C Kastner et al. EMBO J 9 1603 1614 1990 Wei et al. Mol Endo 10 1379 1387 1996 of which PR A and PR B are the most abundant. However the ratio of PR A vs. PR B isoforms is not constant among target tissues and this can alter the cellular response because the activity of each isoform can vary.

There are very few compounds that exhibit partial progestin activity under a wide variety of conditions. RU 486 the most commonly used antiprogestin displays partial agonist activity only under selected conditions. Antiprogestin compounds with partial agonist activity are useful for treating various progestin regulated diseases and conditions however the few known antiprogestins have only limited partial agonist activity and there remains a need in the art for antiprogestins with broad range partial agonist activity.

Worldwide population growth and social awareness of family planning have stimulated a great deal of research in contraception. Contraception is a difficult subject under any circumstance. It is fraught with cultural and social stigma religious implications and most certainly significant health concerns. This situation is only exacerbated when the subject focuses on male contraception. Despite the availability of suitable contraceptive devices historically society has looked to women to be responsible for contraceptive decisions and their consequences. Although concern over sexually transmitted diseases has made men more aware of the need to develop safe and responsible sexual habits women still often bear the brunt of contraceptive choice. Women have a number of choices from temporary mechanical devices such as sponges and diaphragms to temporary chemical devices such as spermicides. Women also have at their disposal more permanent options such as physical devices including IUDs and cervical caps as well as more permanent chemical treatments such as birth control pills and subcutaneous implants. However to date the only options available for men include the use of condoms and vasectomy. Condom use however is not favored by many men because of the reduced sexual sensitivity the interruption in sexual spontaneity and the significant possibility of pregnancy caused by breakage or misuse. Vasectomies are also not favored. If more convenient methods of birth control were available to men particularly long term methods which require no preparative activity immediately prior to a sexual act such methods could significantly increase the likelihood that men would take more responsibility for contraception.

Administration of the male sex steroids e.g. testosterone and its derivatives has shown particular promise in this regard due to the combined gonadotropin suppressing and androgen substituting properties of these compounds Steinberger et al. Effect of Chronic Administration of Testosterone Enanthate on Sperm Production and Plasma Testosterone Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone Levels A Preliminary Evaluation of a Possible Male Contraceptive Fertility and Sterility 28 1320 28 1977 . Chronic administration of high doses of testosterone completely abolishes sperm production azoospermia or reduces it to a very low level oligospermia . The degree of spermatogenic suppression necessary to produce infertility is not precisely known. However a recent report by the World Health Organization showed that weekly intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate result in azoospermia or severe oligospermia i.e. less than 3 million sperm per ml and infertility in 98 of men receiving therapy World Health Organization Task Force on Methods And Regulation of Male Fertility Contraceptive Efficacy of Testosterone Induced Azoospermia and Oligospermia in Normal Men Fertility and Sterility 65 821 29 1996 .

A variety of testosterone esters have been developed which are more slowly absorbed after intramuscular injection and thus result in greater androgenic effect. Testosterone enanthate is the most widely used of these esters. While testosterone enanthate has been valuable in terms of establishing the feasibility of hormonal agents for male contraception it has several drawbacks including the need for weekly injections and the presence of supraphysiologic peak levels of testosterone immediately following intramuscular injection Wu Effects of Testosterone Enanthate in Normal Men Experience From a Multicenter Contraceptive Efficacy Study Fertility and Sterility 65 626 36 1996 .

Bone mineral density BMD decreases with age in both males and females. Decreased amounts of bone mineral content BMC and BMD correlate with decreased bone strength and predispose patients to fracture.

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S. the condition affects more than 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year including 500 000 spine 250 000 hip and 240 000 wrist fractures annually. Hip fractures are the most serious consequence of osteoporosis with 5 20 of patients dying within one year and over 50 of survivors being incapacitated. The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of the population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecasted to increase three fold over the next 60 years and one study estimated that there will be 4.5 million hip fractures worldwide in 2050.

Women are at greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years following menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking alcohol abuse a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake. However osteoporosis also occurs frequently in males. It is well established that the bone mineral density of males decrease with age. Decreased amounts of bone mineral content and density correlates with decreased bone strength and predisposes to fracture. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of sex hormones in non reproductive tissues are only beginning to be understood but it is clear that physiologic concentrations of androgens and estrogens play an important role in maintaining bone homeostasis throughout the life cycle. Consequently when androgen or estrogen deprivation occurs there is a resultant increase in the rate of bone remodeling that tilts the balance of resorption and formation to the favor of resorption that contributes to the overall loss of bone mass. In males the natural decline in sex hormones at maturity direct decline in androgens as well as lower levels of estrogens derived from peripheral aromatization of androgens is associated with the frailty of bones. This effect is also observed in males who have been castrated.

Muscle wasting refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement cardiac muscles which control the heart cardiomyopathics and smooth muscles. Chronic muscle wasting is a chronic condition i.e. persisting over a long period of time characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass weakening and degeneration of muscle.

The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by muscle protein degradation by catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation an unusually low rate of protein synthesis or a combination of both. Muscle protein catabolism whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting.

Muscle wasting is associated with chronic neurological genetic or infectious pathologies diseases illnesses or conditions. These include muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy muscle atrophies such as post polio muscle atrophy PPMA cachexias such as cardiac cachexia aids cachexia and cancer cachexia malnutrition leprosy diabetes renal disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD cancer end stage renal failure sarcopenia emphysema osteomalacia HIV infection AIDS and cardiomyopathy.

In addition other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting. These include chronic lower back pain advanced age central nervous system CNS injury peripheral nerve injury spinal cord injury chemical injury central nervous system CNS damage peripheral nerve damage spinal cord damage chemical damage burns disuse deconditioning that occurs when a limb is immobilized long term hospitalization due to illness or injury and alcoholism.

An intact androgen receptor AR signaling pathway is crucial for appropriate development of skeletal muscles. Furthermore an intact AR signaling pathway increases lean muscle mass muscle strength and muscle protein synthesis.

Muscle wasting if left unabated can have dire health consequences. For example the changes that occur during muscle wasting can lead to a weakened physical state that is detrimental to an individual s health resulting in increased susceptibility to bone fracture and poor physical performance status. In addition muscle wasting is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from cachexia and AIDS.

New innovative approaches are urgently needed at both the basic science and clinical levels to develop compounds which are useful for a male contraception b treatment of a variety of hormone related conditions for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male ADAM such as fatigue depression decreased libido sexual dysfunction erectile dysfunction hypogonadism osteoporosis hair loss anemia obesity sarcopenia osteopenia osteoporosis benign prostate hyperplasia alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer c treatment of conditions associated with ADIF such as sexual dysfunction decreased sexual libido hypogonadism sarcopenia osteopenia osteoporosis alterations in cognition and mood depression anemia hair loss obesity endometriosis breast cancer uterine cancer and ovarian cancer d treatment and or prevention of chronic muscular wasting or sarcopenia e decreasing the incidence of halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer f oral androgen replacement and or other clinical therapeutic and or diagnostic areas.

A wide variety of diseases and or conditions are affected by hypogonadism and catabolic effects including kidney disease central nervous system injuries burns and chronic wounds.

In the United States US there is a rising incidence and prevalence of kidney failure. The number of patients enrolled in end stage renal disease ESRD Medicare funded programs has increased from approximately 10 000 beneficiaries in 1973 to 86 354 in 1983 and to 431 284 as of Dec. 31 2002. In 2002 alone 100 359 patients entered the US ESRD program. Chronic kidney disease CKD is a precursor to ESRD and occurs when the kidneys are not able to adequately remove wastes from the body. CKD is a slowly progressing disease in which diabetes hypertension and anemia may be co morbid conditions.

CKD is diagnosed using a staging system that demonstrates the amount of kidney function available stage 1 normal kidney function and patients often do not present symptoms in the early stages. Stage 5 of CKD is ESRD which is a complete or near complete failure of the kidneys and usually occurs when kidney function is less than 10 of baseline.

Accompanying symptoms associated with ESRD include hypogonadism involuntary weight loss fatigue and others.

Burns result in a testosterone reduction nitrogen level reduction and a reduction in bone mineral density BMD which may persist even as long as one year following the injury and is associated with impaired wound healing increased infection risks erosion of lean body mass hampered rehabilitation and delayed reintegration of burn survivors into society. Catabolic effects initiated as a result of the burn lead to significant involuntary weight loss further compounding the problem.

Spinal cord injuries SCI may result in the alteration central neurotransmitter secretion or production which in turn may cause a hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis dysfunction leading to decreases in testosterone and other hormone levels. SCI or other acute illness or trauma characteristically includes heightened catabolism in conjunction with the lowered anabolic activity resulting in a condition that is prone to loss of lean body tissue. As long as the catabolic process goes uninterrupted disturbed nutrient utilization will continue. The effects of the loss of lean body mass include the development of wounds and impaired healing mechanisms. Because of poor nutrition and protein combined with immobilization patients with spinal cord injury are at high risk for bed sores.

Chronic wounds may be caused by any number of conditions including diabetes circulatory problems immobilization and others. Compounding the problem for example in diabetes is the presence of neuropathy which increases the risk of foot ulceration.

While there are many treatments and therapies for these conditions none are ideal. Since the androgen receptor AR signaling pathway has been shown to increase lean muscle mass muscle strength and muscle protein synthesis and since hypogonadism accompanies these conditions molecules targeting the AR signaling pathway may be useful in treating these diseases and or conditions.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.

This invention provides in one embodiment a substituted quinoline and acridine compounds characterized by the structure of formula I. In one embodiment the compound is a SARM. In one embodiment the compound is useful in treating a variety of conditions or diseases including inter alia oral testosterone replacement therapy male contraception maintaining sexual desire in women osteoporosis treating prostate cancer and or imaging prostate cancer. In some embodiments the compounds of this invention are nonsteroidal ligands for the AR and exhibit androgenic and or anabolic activity.

In some embodiments this invention provides synthetic processes of preparation of the compounds of this invention. In some embodiments the invention provides compositions comprising the compounds of this invention or use of the same for binding an AR modulating spermatogenesis bone formation and or resorption treating muscle wasting or diseases associated with muscle wasting treating prostate cancer and or providing hormonal therapy for androgen dependent conditions.

In one embodiment this invention provides a method for designing a selective androgen receptor modulator compound. The method comprises constructing a potential compound de novo within the active site of the ligand binding domain of a crystalline bound androgen receptor and synthesizing the potential compound. A determination is made whether the potential compound exhibits an antagonistic effect or an agonistic effect on the androgen receptor upon binding thereto where the presence of said effect indicates the potential compound is a selective androgen receptor modulator.

Novel selective androgen receptor modulator platforms may be designed de novo inside the active site of the androgen receptor AR . De novo design of SARM platforms utilizes techniques that progressively construct the ligand inside the active site of the androgen receptor and then score the results to rank which new ligands are the best for interacting with AR. De novo design utilizes many of the same conformational sampling algorithms and scoring functions as molecular docking. In addition to docking preconceived ligands into the receptor modern computing provides for the generation of many thousands of de novo ligands thereby virtually screening many compounds that would not be conceived by chemical intuition. In addition to de novo design as described herein the present invention may be used to virtually screen user defined ligands using the concepts of molecular docking. The present invention also may be used to facilitate and augment pharmacore based searches of molecule databases such as the commercially available Available Chemical Database ACD or open source Zinc database. These techniques are implicitly directed at new template discovery since no preconceptions are given to the computer regarding ligand structure. A further advantage of the de novo approach as compared to virtual screening is that often the de novo leads are novel because the methodology is not searching pre existing molecules or variants as in the traditional active analogue approach. It is contemplated that de novo designed SARMs could have new and improved tissue selectivities.

A wasting condition or disorder is defined herein as a condition or disorder that is characterized at least in part by an abnormal progressive loss of body organ or tissue mass. A wasting condition can occur as a result of a pathology such as for example cancer or an infection or it can be due to a physiologic or metabolic state such as disuse deconditioning that can occur for example due to prolonged bed rest or when a limb is immobilized such as in a cast. A wasting condition can also be age associated. The loss of body mass that occurs during a wasting condition can be characterized by a loss of total body weight or a loss of organ weight such as a loss of bone or muscle mass due to a decrease in tissue protein.

In one embodiment muscle wasting or muscular wasting used herein interchangeably refer to the progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement cardiac muscles which control the heart and smooth muscles. In one embodiment the muscle wasting condition or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. Chronic muscle wasting is defined herein as the chronic i.e. persisting over a long period of time progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the chronic progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle.

The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation an unusually low rate of protein synthesis or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term catabolism has its commonly known meaning in the art specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.

Muscle wasting can occur as a result of a pathology disease condition or disorder. In one embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is chronic. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is genetic. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is neurological. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is infectious. As described herein the pathologies diseases conditions or disorders for which the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered are those that directly or indirectly produce a wasting i.e. loss of muscle mass that is a muscle wasting disorder.

In one embodiment muscle wasting in a subject is a result of the subject having a muscular dystrophie muscle atrophy X linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA .

The muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal or voluntary muscles that control movement. The muscles of the heart and some other involuntary muscles are also affected in some forms of muscular dystrophy. The major forms of muscular dystrophy MD are duchenne muscular dystrophy myotonic dystrophy duchenne muscular dystrophy becker muscular dystrophy limb girdle muscular dystrophy facioscapulhumeral muscular dystrophy congenital muscular dystrophy oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy distal muscular dystrophy and emery dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Muscular dystrophy can affect people of all ages. Although some forms first become apparent in infancy or childhood others may not appear until middle age or later. Duchenne MD is the most common form typically affecting children. Myotonic dystrophy is the most common of these diseases in adults.

Muscle atrophy MA is characterized by wasting away or diminution of muscle and a decrease in muscle mass. For example Post Polio MA is a muscle wasting that occurs as part of the post polio syndrome PPS . The atrophy includes weakness muscle fatigue and pain.

Another type of MA is X linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA also known as Kennedy s Disease . This disease arises from a defect in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome affects only males and its onset is in adulthood. Because the primary disease cause is an androgen receptor mutation androgen replacement is not a current therapeutic strategy. There are some investigational studies where exogenous testosterone propionate is being given to boost the levels of androgen with hopes of overcoming androgen insensitivity and perhaps provide an anabolic effect. Still use of supraphysiological levels of testosterone for supplementation will have limitations and other potentially serious complications.

Sarcopenia is a debilitating disease that afflicts the elderly and chronically ill patients and is characterized by loss of muscle mass and function. Further increased lean body mass is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality for certain muscle wasting disorders. In addition other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting disorders. For example studies have shown that in severe cases of chronic lower back pain there is paraspinal muscle wasting.

Muscle wasting and other tissue wasting is also associated with advanced age. It is believed that general weakness in old age is due to muscle wasting. As the body ages an increasing proportion of skeletal muscle is replaced by fibrous tissue. The result is a significant reduction in muscle power performance and endurance.

Long term hospitalization due to illness or injury or disuse deconditioning that occurs for example when a limb is immobilized can also lead to muscle wasting or wasting of other tissue. Studies have shown that in patients suffering injuries chronic illnesses burns trauma or cancer who are hospitalized for long periods of time there is a long lasting unilateral muscle wasting and a decrease in body mass.

Injuries or damage to the central nervous system CNS are also associated with muscle wasting and other wasting disorders. Injuries or damage to the CNS can be for example caused by diseases trauma or chemicals. Examples are central nerve injury or damage peripheral nerve injury or damage and spinal cord injury or damage. In one embodiment CNS damage or injury comprise Alzheimer s diseases AD anger mood anorexia anorexia nervosa anorexia associated with aging and or assertiveness mood .

In some embodiments wasting is due to infection with enterovirus Epstein Barr virus herpes zoster HIV trypanosomes influenze coxsackie rickettsia trichinella schistosoma or mycobacteria and this invention in some embodiments provides methods of treatment thereof.

Cachexia is weakness and a loss of weight caused by a disease or as a side effect of illness. Cardiac cachexia i.e. a muscle protein wasting of both the cardiac and skeletal muscle is a characteristic of congestive heart failure. Cancer cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is manifested by weight loss with massive depletion of both adipose tissue and lean muscle mass.

Cachexia is also seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ADS human immunodeficiency virus HIV associated myopathy and or muscle weakness wasting is a relatively common clinical manifestation of AIDS. Individuals with HIV associated myopathy or muscle weakness or wasting typically experience significant weight loss generalized or proximal muscle weakness tenderness and muscle atrophy.

In some embodiments central nervous system diseases comprise injuries or damage to the central nervous system CNS . In some embodiments injuries or damage to the CNS may be associated with muscle wasting disorders. Injuries or damage to the CNS can be for example caused by diseases trauma or chemicals. Examples are central nerve injury or damage peripheral nerve injury or damage and spinal cord injury or damage.

Studies involving patients with spinal cord injuries SCI have shown that central neurotransmitters may be altered after SCI causing hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis dysfunction whose disruption led to a significant decrease in testosterone and other hormone levels. SCI or other acute illness or trauma characteristically includes heightened catabolism in conjunction with the lowered anabolic activity resulting in a condition that is prone to loss of lean body tissue which is often accompanied by disturbed nutrient utilization. The effects of the loss of lean body mass include the development of wounds and impaired healing mechanisms further compounding the problem. Because of poor nutrition and protein catabolism combined with immobilization patients with spinal cord injury are at high risk for bed sores.

In one embodiment a wide variety of injuries of the CNS may be treated by the methods of the present invention. CNS injury may refer in one embodiment to a breakdown of the membrane of a nerve cell or in another embodiment to the inability of the nerve to produce and propagate nerve impulses or in another embodiment to the death of the cell. An injury includes damage that directly or indirectly affects the normal functioning of the CNS. The injury may be a structural physical or mechanical impairment and may be caused by physical impact as in the case of a crushing compression or stretching of nerve fibers. Alternatively the cell membrane may be destroyed by or degraded by an illness a chemical imbalance or a physiological malfunction such as anoxia e.g. stroke aneurysm or reperfusion. A CNS injury includes for example and without limitation damage to retinal ganglion cells a traumatic brain injury a stroke related injury a cerebral aneurism related injury a spinal cord injury including monoplegia diplegia paraplegia hemiplegia and quadriplegia a neuroproliferative disorder or neuropathic pain syndrome.

With injury to the spinal cord of a mammal connections between nerves in the spinal cord are broken. Such injuries block the flow of nerve impulses for the nerve tracts affected by the injury with a resulting impairment to both sensory and motor function. Injuries to the spinal cord may arise from compression or other contusion of the spinal cord or a crushing or severing of the spinal cord. A severing of the spinal cord also referred to herein as a transection may be a complete severing or may be an incomplete severing of the spinal cord.

In some embodiments the methods of treating a subject suffering form a CNS injury or in other embodiments spinal cord injury may be accompanied by treatment of the subject with electrical stimulation of the injured site and the administration of a purine nucleoside or analog thereof for example as described in United States Patent Application Publication Number 20040214790A1.

In one embodiment the dermatological disorder is a wound or a burn. In some embodiments wounds and or ulcers are found protruding from the skin or on a mucosal surface or as a result of an infarction in an organ. A wound may be a result of a soft tissue defect or a lesion or of an underlying condition. In one embodiment the term wound denotes a bodily injury with disruption of the normal integrity of tissue structures. The term is also intended to encompass the terms sore lesion necrosis and ulcer . In one embodiment the term sore refers to any lesion of the skin or mucous membranes and the term ulcer refers to a local defect or excavation of the surface of an organ or tissue which is produced by the sloughing of necrotic tissue. Lesion generally relates to any tissue defect. Necrosis is related to dead tissue resulting from infection injury inflammation or infarctions. All of these are encompassed by the term wound which denotes any wound at any particular stage in the healing process including the stage before any healing has initiated or even before a specific wound like a surgical incision is made prophylactic treatment .

Examples of wounds which can be prevented and or treated in accordance with the present invention are e.g. aseptic wounds contused wounds incised wounds lacerated wounds non penetrating wounds i.e. wounds in which there is no disruption of the skin but there is injury to underlying structures open wounds penetrating wounds perforating wounds puncture wounds septic wounds subcutaneous wounds etc. Examples of sores are bed sores canker sores chrome sores cold sores pressure sores etc. Examples of ulcers are e.g. peptic ulcer duodenal ulcer gastric ulcer gouty ulcer diabetic ulcer hypertensive ischemic ulcer stasis ulcer ulcus cruris venous ulcer sublingual ulcer submucous ulcer symptomatic ulcer trophic ulcer tropical ulcer veneral ulcer e.g. caused by gonorrhoea including urethritis endocervicitis and proctitis . Conditions related to wounds or sores which may be successfully treated according to the invention are burns anthrax tetanus gas gangrene scalatina erysipelas sycosis barbae folliculitis impetigo contagiosa or impetigo bullosa etc. There is often a certain overlap between the use of the terms wound and ulcer and wound and sore and furthermore the terms are often used at random. Therefore as mentioned above in the present context the term wounds encompasses the term ulcer lesion sore and infarction and the terms are indiscriminately used unless otherwise indicated.

The kinds of wounds to be treated according to the invention include also i general wounds such as e.g. surgical traumatic infectious ischemic thermal chemical and bullous wounds ii wounds specific for the oral cavity such as e.g. post extraction wounds endodontic wounds especially in connection with treatment of cysts and abscesses ulcers and lesions of bacterial viral or autoimmunological origin mechanical chemical thermal infectious and lichenoid wounds herpes ulcers stomatitis aphthosa acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis and burning mouth syndrome are specific examples and iii wounds on the skin such as e.g. neoplasm burns e.g. chemical thermal lesions bacterial viral autoimmunological bites and surgical incisions. Another way of classifying wounds is as i small tissue loss due to surgical incisions minor abrasions and minor bites or as ii significant tissue loss. The latter group includes ischemic ulcers pressure sores fistulae lacerations severe bites thermal burns and donor site wounds in soft and hard tissues and infarctions.

In other aspects of the invention the wound to be prevented and or treated is selected from the group consisting of aseptic wounds infarctions contused wounds incised wounds lacerated wounds non penetrating wounds open wounds penetrating wounds perforating wounds puncture wounds septic wounds and subcutaneous wounds.

Other wounds which are of importance in connection with the present invention are wounds like ischemic ulcers pressure sores fistulae severe bites thermal burns and donor site wounds.

In another embodiment the compound as described herein is useful in a chronic catabolic state coma wasting conditions starvation eating disorders concomitant bone fracture and muscle damage critical illness in which muscle or bone wasting are apparent and or connective tissue diseases and disorders.

Ischemic ulcers and pressure sores are wounds which normally only heal very slowly and especially in such cases an improved and more rapid healing is of course of great importance for the patient. Furthermore the costs involved in the treatment of patients suffering from such wounds are markedly reduced when the healing is improved and takes place more rapidly.

Donor site wounds are wounds which e.g. occur in connection with removal of hard tissue from one part of the body to another part of the body e.g. in connection with transplantation. The wounds resulting from such operations are very painful and an improved healing is therefore most valuable.

The term skin is used in a very broad sense embracing the epidermal layer of the skin and in those cases where the skin surface is more or less injured also the dermal layer of the skin. Apart from the stratum corneum the epidermal layer of the skin is the outer epithelial layer and the deeper connective tissue layer of the skin is called the dermis.

A wasting condition or disorder is defined herein as a condition or disorder that is characterized at least in part by an abnormal progressive loss of body organ or tissue mass. A wasting condition can occur as a result of a pathology such as for example cancer or it can be due to a physiologic or metabolic state such as disuse deconditioning that can occur for example due to prolonged bed rest or when a limb is immobilized such as in a cast or with the occurrence of multiple wounds including for example amputation as occurs in diabetics and other conditions as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. A wasting condition can also be age associated. The loss of body mass that occurs during a wasting condition can be characterized by a loss of total body weight or a loss of organ weight such as a loss of bone or muscle mass due to a decrease in tissue protein.

In one embodiment the terms muscle wasting or muscular wasting refer to the progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement cardiac muscles which control the heart and smooth muscles. In one embodiment the muscle wasting condition or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. Chronic muscle wasting is defined herein as the chronic i.e. persisting over a long period of time progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the chronic progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle.

The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation an unusually low rate of protein synthesis or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term catabolism has its commonly known meaning in the art specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.

Muscle wasting can occur as a result of pathology disease condition or disorders including disorders for treatment via the methods of this invention such as for example end stage renal failure.

In some embodiments the compounds as herein described and or compositions comprising the same may be used for applications in or treating diseases or conditions associated with a subject having diabetes. In one embodiment the subject for whom treatment is sought via the methods of this invention is one with diabetic I. Type I diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Markers of immune destruction of the beta cell are present at the time of diagnosis in 90 of individuals and include antibodies to the islet cell ICAs to glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD and to insulin IAAs . While this form of diabetes usually occurs in children and adolescents it can occur at any age. Younger individuals typically have a rapid rate of beta cell destruction and present with ketoacidosis while adults often maintain sufficient insulin secretion to prevent ketoacidosis for many years. Eventually all type I diabetic patients require insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia.

In one embodiment this invention provides a method of treating diabetes type II. Type II diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and at some stage in pathogenesis of the disease a relative deficiency of insulin secretion. In absolute terms the plasma insulin concentration both fasting and meal stimulated usually is increased although relative to the severity of insulin resistance the plasma insulin concentration is insufficient to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. With time however there is progressive beta cell failure and absolute insulin deficiency ensues. Most individuals with type II diabetes exhibit intra abdominal visceral obesity fatty liver which is closely related to the presence of insulin resistance. The patient s liver becomes insulin resistant and glycogen breakdown is uncontrolled and the result is increased and unphysiological glucose delivery to the bloodstream. The liver generated cholesterol and VLDL particles is also uncontrolled. In addition hypertension dyslipidemia high triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol levels postprandial hyperlipemia and elevated PAI 1 levels often are present in these individuals. This clustering of abnormalities is referred to as the insulin resistance syndrome or the metabolic syndrome or obesity related disorders. Because of these abnormalities patients with type II diabetes are at increased risk of developing macrovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

In one embodiment this invention provides a method of treating diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes that evolves early typically before clinical diagnosis of diabetes is made. The earliest clinical evidence of nephropathy is the appearance of low but abnormal levels 30 mg day or 20 g min of albumin in the urine microalbuminuria followed by albuminuria 300 mg 24 h or 200 g min that develops over a period of 10 15 years. In patients with type 1 diabetes diabetic hypertension typically becomes manifest early on by the time that patients develop microalbuminuria. Once overt nephropathy occurs the glomerular filtration rate GFR falls over a course of times which may be several years resulting in end stage renal disease ESRD in diabetic individuals.

In one embodiment this invention provides a method of treating diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy is a family of nerve disorders caused by diabetes. Diabetic neuropathies cause numbness and sometimes pain and weakness in the hands arms feet and legs. Neurologic problems in diabetes may occur in every organ system including the digestive tract heart and genitalia. Diabetic neuropathies are classified as peripheral autonomic proximal and focal. Peripheral neuropathy causes pain or loss of feeling in the toes feet legs hands and arms. Autonomic neuropathy causes changes in digestion bowel and bladder function sexual response and perspiration and can also affect the nerves that serve the heart and control blood pressure. Proximal neuropathy causes pain in the thighs hips or buttocks and leads to weakness in the legs. Focal neuropathy results in the sudden weakness of one nerve or a group of nerves causing muscle weakness or pain. Any nerve in the body may be affected.

In one embodiment this invention provides a method of treating diabetic retinopathy. The effect of diabetes on the eye is called diabetic retinopathy. Patients with diabetes are more likely to develop eye problems such as cataracts and glaucoma. The affect of diabetic retinopathy on vision varies widely depending on the stage of the disease. Some common symptoms of diabetic retinopathy are blurred vision this is often linked to blood sugar levels floaters and flashes and sudden loss of vision.

In one embodiment the subject for whom treatment is sought via the methods of this invention is one with glucose intolerance. Glucose intolerance is a pre diabetic state in which the blood glucose is higher than normal but not high enough to warrant the diagnosis of diabetes.

In one embodiment the subject for whom treatment is sought via the methods of this invention is one with hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia is a sign of an underlying problem that is causing the pancreas to secrete excessive amounts of insulin. The most common cause of hyperinsulinemia is insulin resistance a condition in which your body is resistant to the effects of insulin and the pancreas tries to compensate by making more insulin. hyperinsulinemia is associated with type II diabetes

In one embodiment the subject for whom treatment is sought via the methods of this invention is one with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a condition in which normal amounts of insulin are inadequate to produce a normal insulin response from fat muscle and liver cells. Insulin resistance in fat cells results in hydrolysis of stored triglycerides which elevates free fatty acids in the blood plasma. Insulin resistance in muscle reduces glucose uptake whereas insulin resistance in liver reduces glucose storage with both effects serving to elevate blood glucose. High plasma levels of insulin and glucose due to insulin resistance often leads to the metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes.

Diabetes and the liver obesity is typically associated with elevated levels of free fatty acid FFAs that promote lipid accumulation and insulin resistance in target tissues i.e. reduced action of insulin primarily in skeletal muscle and liver. A prominent role of insulin is to reduce glucose output from the liver. FFAs stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis which per se does not lead to increased hepatic glucose output as long as it is paralleled by a decrease in hepatic glycogenolysis a compensatory process referred to as hepatic autoregulation . FFAs stimulate insulin secretion and insulin blocks glycogenolysis in part by inhibiting secretion of glucagon an inducer of glycogenolysis. However long term elevated levels of FFAs leads to hepatic insulin resistance and thus breakdown of hepatic autoregulation resulting in increased hepatic glucose production and development of type II diabetes. Fatty liver and hepatic insulin resistance is a major driving force behind hyperglycemia and type II diabetes.

In one embodiment this invention provides methods that inhibit improve the fatty liver resulting in that the insulin resistance in the liver is inhibited improved and thereby solving the basic problem in type II diabetes.
