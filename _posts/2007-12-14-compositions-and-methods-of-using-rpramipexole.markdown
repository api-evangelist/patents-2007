 R pramipexole is an enantiomer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the approved Parkinson s disease PD and restless legs syndrome RLS treatment Mirapex pramipexole S pramipexole . Mirapex is a high affinity low nM IC agonist at human and rodent recombinant dopamine Dand Dreceptors a property that is the pharmacological basis of its efficacy in these disorders. Both the R and the S enantiomers have been shown preclinically to possess neuroprotective properties that are independent of dopamine receptor affinity.

Neuroprotective properties of S pramipexole have been recognized as potentially useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders but clinical experience with the drug for treatment of dopamine deficiency disorders such as PD have shown that dosing is limited both temporally by the need for prolonged dose titration and absolutely in terms of maximum tolerated dose MTD due to dopamine agonist related side effects. These dosing limitations are typical for dopamine receptor agonists of this class.

The maximum allowable single starting dose for Mirapex is 0.125 mg given three times a day t.i.d. and the maximum allowable dose for Mirapex is 1.5 mg t.i.d. providing a maximum daily dose of 4.5 mg of Mirapex after 7 8 weeks of titration.

While these dose levels of Mirapex are useful for treatment of the signs and symptoms of PD and RLS in neuroprotective assays the potency of S pramipexole as a neuroprotective is approximately 1000 fold lower than its potency as a dopamine agonist. This suggests the therapeutically useful neuroprotective doses cannot be reached using this enantiomer.

 R pramipexole possesses similar neuroprotective potency but lower affinity for dopamine receptors. Accordingly it has been advanced as a potentially more useful compound for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. However previously reported dopamine receptor affinity difference for the R pramipexole compared to S pramipexole would still impose clinically important dose limitations and would still require dose titration and dose limitations to avoid dopamine related side effects. In previous reports utilizing R pramipexole in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS a rapidly progressing fatal neurodegenerative disorder dosing of R pramipexole was suggested to be limited and to require significant dose titration in animal experiments. The assumed requirement for dose titration specifically the requirement to start dosing at very low doses and increase the dose to a final therapeutically effective dose level over 7 8 weeks severely limits the usefulness of the neuroprotective potential of the R pramipexole enantiomer Additionally the assumed MTD would severely limit the timely exploitation of the neuroprotective potential of the R pramipexole enantiomer for both acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders.

The present invention unlocks the therapeutic potential of R pramipexole by achieving clinically purified R pramipexole and determining the actual in vitro and in vivo binding affinity and tolerance of a patient to purified R pramipexole. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention larger doses of R pramipexole can be administered to a patient in need thereof.

The present invention further provides a method of treating neurodegenerative disease in a patient in need thereof comprising administering to the patient a daily dose amount of about 25 mgs to about 5 000 mgs of R pramipexole more preferably about 500 mgs to about 2 100 most preferably above 500 mgs and less than 2 100 mgs of R pramipexole on a daily basis.

In some embodiments the disease to be treated is acute and in others it is chronic. In some embodiments the chronic neurodegenerative disease is selected from primary neurodegenerative disease Huntington s Chorea metabolically induced neurological damage senile dementia of Alzheimer s type age associated cognitive dysfunction vascular dementia multi infarct dementia Lewy body dementia neurodegenerative dementia neurodegenerative movement disorder ataxia Friedreich s ataxia multiple sclerosis spinal muscular atrophy primary lateral sclerosis seizure disorders motor neuron disorder or disease inflammatory demyelinating disorder Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis hepatic encephalopathy and chronic encephalitis. In some embodiments the chronic neurodegenerative disease is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In some embodiments the patient is a na ve patient.

The present invention provides evidence that the dopamine receptor affinity of R pramipexole is actually much lower than that previously assumed which greatly increases the clinical usefulness of the composition. It is also demonstrated herein that the functional affinity difference between the S pramipexole and R pramipexole enantiomers e.g. 10 000 20 000 fold is much greater than previously reported. These data demonstrate that It pramipexole can be dosed at levels that can more fully and unexpectedly exploit the lower potency neuroprotective potential of the compound without the theoretical limitation imposed by the assumptions about separation in dopamine receptor affinity between the enantiomers. This dosing may occur without the need for dose titration. These data also show that contamination of the composition of pure R pramipexole with small amounts of S pramipexole results in dramatic shifts in the off target of the composition. The application presents methods for using chirally more pure compositions of R pramipexole in acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders previously thought to be inaccessible to this drug at immediate full strength and or without dose titration.

In some embodiments the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising R pramipexole of sufficient doses to achieve neuroprotective anti oxidative anti apoptotic or other beneficial cellular effects without simultaneously causing significant side effects. The ability to deliver clinically effective doses without dose limiting side effects is made possible by two basic discoveries i the synthesis of R pramipexole that is pure within limits of the detection discussed herein and ii the discovery that R pramipexole possesses substantially less affinity for dopamine receptors than previously reported. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be dependent in some embodiments on either or both the optical purity of the R pramipexole used in the composition or upon the limited dopaminergic activity of the chirally pure R pramipexole used in the composition.

Before the present compositions and methods are described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular processes compositions or methodologies described as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used in the description is for the purpose of describing the particular versions or embodiments only and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention which will be limited only by the appended claims. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety to the extent to support the present invention.

The compound 2 amino 4 5 6 7 tetrahydro 6 propylamino benzothiazole is a synthetic aminobenzothiazole derivative having two enantiomers with the structures shown below. The S enantiomer is a potent agonist of the 12 family of dopamine receptors with particular affinity for the 13 receptor subtype. As a dopamine agonist S pramipexole activates dopamine receptors thus mimicking the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The S pramipexole stereoisomer is a potent agonist of dopamine with only small daily doses required and indeed tolerated by patients. Both enantiomers are thought to confer neuroprotective effects by their ability to accumulate in the brain the spinal cord and mitochondria and independent of the dopamine agonist activity presumably through inhibition of lipid peroxidation normalization of mitochondrial function and or detoxification of oxygen radicals. As such these compounds may have utility as inhibitors of the cell death cascades and loss of cell viability observed in neurodegenerative diseases.

The degree to which dosing of a molecule has demonstrable phenotypic activity resulting from affinity to particular receptors or other pharmaco effective proteins even when the activity results from affinities to unknown targets can be operationally defined in terms of whether this activity contributes in a positive way on target activity or a negative way off target activity to a specific and desired therapeutic effect. For any given molecule a number of off target activities can theoretically be identified but on target activity is restricted to the desired therapeutic effect. To the extent that these activities can be measured and quantified or comparisons be made with known standards an index of activity can be generated for each of these categories the activity equivalent or AE and one or more ratios generated to compare off target to on target activities useful to compare potential risk benefit ratios between molecules.

In the case of R pramipexole two activities can be defined in this context. The first which is agonist activity at a subset of human dopamine receptors and the resulting behavioral toxicological phenotype is off target activity for most neurodegenerative disorders. This activity results in dose limiting side effects due to dopamine receptor agonist activity and for the purposes of the current discussion can be defined to be the dopamine activity equivalent or DAE. Throughout the application the term dopaminergic activity equivalent DAE will be referred to which means the measure of activity at the dopamine receptors equivalent to the activity of 1 mg of S pramipexole at the dopamine receptors. For example a dosage of R pramipexole having a DAE of 0.01 would have activity at the dopamine receptors which is equivalent to the activity of 0.01 mg of S pramipexole. The DAE can also be related to a variety of pharmaceutical terms including maximum tolerated dose MTD no observable adverse effect level NOAEL and non effective dose amount for the sake of clarity. For example the NOAEL dose amount for S pramipexole is most preferably below 0.05 mg. This in turn corresponds to a DAE of below 0.05. A dose amount of R pramipexole having a DAE of 0.01 would therefore be below the DAE for the most preferable S pramipexole NOAEL dose amount of 0.05 mg. In some embodiments DAE is determined by measuring the binding affinity IC or activity EC at the Dand or Dreceptors relative to the same parameter for 1 mg of S pramipexole. In some embodiments DAE is determined by the binding affinity or activity at the Dreceptor. In some embodiments DAE is determined by the binding affinity or activity at the Dreceptor. In some embodiments DAE is determined by the binding affinity at the Dreceptor. In some embodiments DAE is determined by the binding affinity at the Dreceptor. In some embodiments DAE is determined by a suitable in vitro assay such as an ICbinding affinity assay for the Dor Dreceptor such as those described by Schneider C. S. Mierau J. Dopamine Autoreceptor Agonists Resolution and Pharmacological Activity of 2 6 Diaminotetrahydrobenzothiazole and an Aminothiazole Analogue of Apomorphine 1987 . 30 494 498 or Wong S. K. F. Shrikhande A. V. S. K. F. Wong Activation of Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase by Dopamine D2 and D3 Receptors 2003 . This off target activity for R pramipexole in neurodegenerative disorders other than Parkinson s disease would be the on target activity for its enantiomer S pramipexole used to treat PD and restless legs syndrome.

Our studies suggest that the DAE for R pramipexole is much lower than may have been previously appreciated. For example our studies have shown that the binding affinity for R pramipexole to the Dand Ddopamine receptors is about 290 and 649 times lower than S pramipexole respectively when using high chiral purity R pramipexole. By comparison the literature reports that the binding affinity for the R pramipexole to the Ddopamine receptor is about 9 21 times lower than S pramipexole while the binding affinity for the R pramipexole to the Ddopamine receptor is about 50 times lower than S pramipexole.

Even more striking our studies in beagle dogs indicate that the MTD dose ratio of R pramipexole to S pramipexole is 10 000 while the NOAEL dose ratio of R pramipexole to S pramipexole is 20 000. As a biological assay the MTD and NOAEL in dogs reveal in vivo tolerance heretofore entirely unpredictable. Because of limitations on standard and quantitative analysis the in vivo MTD and NOAEL in dogs may actually suggest even the slightest impurity of 0.005 could in fact be responsible for the dopamine agonist related side effects. These comparative studies suggest that the DAE for R pramipexole is much lower than may previously been appreciated.

The other activity of R pramipexole and S pramipexole is neuroprotection. Neuroprotection is a phenomenon independent of mechanism and hence qualifies as a category of activity. This on target activity of R pramipexole for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders is measurable and approximately equivalent in both enantiomers and can be defined in relative terms as the neuroprotective activity equivalent or NAE. The neuroprotective activity equivalent NAP refers to the neuroprotective activity inherent in 1 mg of S pramipexole. Unlike the DAE NAE has been shown to be equal in both pramipexole enantiomers in a number of in vitro tests. In this example the DAE is seen as a unit measure of the potential for adverse effects while the NAE is seen as a unit measure of the potential for therapeutic benefit. For this example the NAEs of both R pramipexole and Mirapex may be determined from the concentrations needed to produce neuroprotection in in vitro assays.

In some embodiments NAP can be determined by measuring the neuroprotective activity in a standard in vitro neuroprotective assay relative to the activity of 1 mg of S pramipexole. In some embodiments the neuroprotective activity is determined by measuring cell death in the presence of MPP and or rotenone in dopaminergic and or non dopaminergic cells as a non limiting example see the assay in M. Gu 91 11075 1081 2004 .

A preferred intent of the present invention is to maximize the NAEs delivered to a patient while minimizing the number of activity equivalents suggestive of adverse events in this case the DAE.

 S pramipexole has a high DAE NAE ratio due to the high dopamine affinity while the corresponding ratio for R pramipexole is significantly lower. In practical terms the embodiments of the present invention provide significantly greater NAE levels and greater NAB DAE levels than previously believed maximizing the probability that a therapeutically effective dose amount of the neuroprotectant can be administered to a patient in need. The NAB and the DAE may be useful in terms of a ratio particularly as a ratio of beneficial to adverse effects and useful to define a range over which a particular composition may be administered.

Dosages of S pramipexole however are limited by the dopaminergic activity of the S enantiomer which can lead to adverse side effects at dosages above the No Observable Adverse Effect Level NOAEL dose amount . A NOAEL dose as used herein refers to an amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that produces no statistically or biologically significant increases in the frequency or severity of adverse effects between an exposed population and its appropriate control some effects may be produced at this level but they are not considered as adverse or as precursors to adverse effects. The exposed population may be a system tissue animal individual or human that is being treated by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. With respect to S pramipexole exemplary adverse events are dizziness hallucination nausea hypotension somnolence constipation headache tremor back pain postural hypotension hypertonia depression abdominal pain anxiety dyspepsia flatulence diarrhea rash ataxia dry mouth extrapyramidal syndrome leg cramps twitching pharyngitis sinusitis sweating rhinitis urinary tract infection vasodilatation flu syndrome increased saliva tooth disease dyspnea increased cough gait abnormalities urinary frequency vomiting allergic reaction hypertension pruritis hypokinesia nervousness dream abnormalities chest pain neck pain paresthesia tachycardia vertigo voice alteration conjunctivitis paralysis tinnitus lacrimation mydriasis and diplopia.

For example a dose of 1.5 mg of S pramipexole has been shown to cause somnolence in human subjects from the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products Boehringer Ingelheim product insert for Mirapex which indicates that the drug is administered as three doses per day . Further studies performed in dogs as presented herein see Examples and results shown in Table 11 indicate that the NOAEL dose may be as low as 0.00125 mg kg which is equivalent to a human dose of 0.0007 mg kg or 0.05 mg for a 70 kg individual. Thus with reference to S pramipexole a NOAEL dose amount may be an amount below 1.5 mg below 0.50 mg or more preferably below 0.05 mg. With reference to DAE as defined herein a NOAEL dose may have a DAE of below 1.5 below 0.5 or more preferably below 0.05.

Generally an amount larger than the non effective dose amount of S pramipexole is necessary to have a therapeutic effect in treating diseases alleviated by dopamine agonist activity. This amount however may not be desired when a neuroprotective effect is sought as it may lead to the described adverse side effects. A non effective dose amount as used herein refers to an amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits a biological or medicinal response similar to the biological or medicinal response of a placebo as observed in a tissue system animal individual or human that is being treated by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. A non effective dose amount may therefore elicit no discernable difference from placebo in positive effects as observed in a tissue system animal individual or human that is being treated by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. As such the non effective dose amount is not expected to 1 prevent a disease for example preventing a disease condition or disorder in an individual that may be predisposed to the disease condition or disorder but does not yet experience or display the pathology or symptomatology of the disease 2 inhibit the disease for example inhibiting a disease condition or disorder in an individual that is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease condition or disorder i.e. arresting or slowing further development of the pathology and or symptomatology or 3 ameliorate the disease for example ameliorating a disease condition or disorder in an individual that is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease condition or disorder i.e. reversing or reducing the pathology and or symptomatology .

As an example in monkeys treated with MPTP 1 methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine a known dopaminergic neurotoxin S pramipexole has been shown to antagonize motor deficits and Parkinson like symptoms in a dose dependent manner with the lowest effective oral dose being 0.053 mg kg see at http www.emea.europa.euhumandocs PDFs EPAR Sifrol 059197EN6.pdf . This would be equivalent to a human dose of 0.017 mg kg or 1.2 mg for a 70 kg individual. In human trials the lowest effective oral dose of S pramipexole with a significant effect versus placebo in the treatment of Parkinson s disease was found to be 1.1 mg day. Individual patients may need doses higher than 1.1 mg day to gain a sufficient effect above the placebo effect from the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products . In human trials the lowest effective dose with a significant effect versus placebo in the treatment of restless legs syndrome was found to be 0.25 mg day Boehringer Ingelheim product insert for Mirapex . Therefore with reference to S pramipexole a non effective dose amount may be an amount below 1.0 mg day below 0.75 mg day below 0.5 mg day below 0.25 mg day or preferably below 0.125 mg day. With reference to DAE a non effective dose amount per day may have a DAE per day below 1.0 below 0.75 below 0.5 below 0.25 or preferably below 0.125.

Other limits on the amount of S pramipexole which can be administered to a patient also include the maximum recommended therapeutic dose and the maximum tolerated dose. A maximum recommended therapeutic dose MRTD refers to the dosages compiled by the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Office of Pharmaceutical Science Informatics and Computational Safety Analysis Staff s Maximum Recommended Therapeutic Dose and as described in Matthews et al. Assessment of the Health Effects of Chemicals in Humans I. QSAR Estimation of the Maximum Recommended Therapeutic Dose MRTD and No Effect Level NOEL of Organic Chemicals Based on Clinical Trial Data 2004 1 61 76 . The FDA s MRTD database cites a MRTD for S pramipexole of 0.1 mg kg day or 7.0 mg day for a 70 lb. person. Matthews in turn estimates that a NOEL no adverse effect level usually is about one tenth of the MRTD which corresponds to 0.01 ng kg or about 0.7 mg day for a 70 lb. person.

Because of its adverse impact on na ve patients S pramipexole must be titrated over the course of weeks to reach these dosages without dose limiting adverse effects such as that documented in Boehringer Ingelheim product insert for Mirapex . For example for restless leg syndrome the recommended starting daily dose amount of Mirapex is 0.125 mg taken once daily 2 3 hours before bedtime. For patients requiring additional symptomatic relief the daily dose may be increased to 0.25 mg over 4 to 7 day period and then to 0.5 mg over a second 4 to 7 day period. For the treatment of Parkinson s disease the package insert recommends the following titration schedule for Mirapex 

A maximum tolerated dose MTD as used herein refers to an amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent which elicits significant toxicity in a tissue system animal individual or human that is being treated by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. Single dose toxicity of S pramipexole after oral administration has been studied in rodents dogs monkeys and human. In rodents deaths occurred at doses of 70 105 mg kg and above from the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products . This is equivalent to a human dose of 7 12 mg kg or approximately 500 850 mg for a 70 kg individual. In human subjects a starting daily dose of S pramipexole of greater than 0.20 mg was not tolerated when administered to a na ve patient. In dogs vomiting occurred at 0.0007 mg kg and above while monkeys displayed major excitation at 3.5 mg kg. Further the product insert for Mirapex sets the maximally tolerated dose for humans at 4.5 mg day administered as three 1.5 mg single dosages. However the 4.5 mg day dosage is not administered to a na ve patient but instead reached after a titration regimen such as that documented in the product insert for Mirapex . Generally the starting daily dosage for administration to a na ve patient is a 0.125 mg dose administered three times per day and a seven week titration schedule is recommended to reach a 1.5 mg dose administered three times daily. All species showed signs of toxicity related to exaggerated pharmacodynamic responses to S pramipexole. For example behavioral changes including hyperactivity were common and led to a number of secondary effects such as reduced body weight and other stress induced symptoms. In minipigs and monkeys S pramipexole moderately affected cardiovascular parameters. In rats the potent prolactin inhibitory effect of pramipexole affected reproductive organs e.g. enlarged corpora lutea pyometra and showed a dose related retinal degeneration during long term exposure from the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products . Studies in dogs indicate a MTD amount of S pramipexole for a human subject may be an amount below 4.5 mg day preferably below 1.5 mg day. Further the MTD amount for a human subject may be an amount below 0.3 mg dose based on results of studies disclosed herein and preferably below 0.2 mg dose see Table 11 . With reference to DAE the MTD amount may have a DAE of below 1.5 below 0.3 or below 0.2.

Given the limits on the amount of S pramipexole that can be administered to a patient the use of the embodiments of the present invention presents a clinically important alternative for the development of new neuroprotective therapies. The literature previously reported that the binding affinity of R pramipexole at the Dreceptor was approximately 9 to 21 times less than about that of S pramipexole while the binding affinity of R pramipexole at the Dreceptor was approximately 50 times less than about that of S pramipexole Table 10 . These literature derived comparative binding affinity ratios suggest that R pramipexole can be administered only at somewhat higher dosages than S pramipexole. This limitation may occur because the exquisite sensitivity of tissues systems animals and human subjects to the effects of dopamine agonism would preclude the use of R pramipexole at doses that exceed tolerated doses of S pramipexole by a factor greater than the literature derived comparative binding affinity ratios of the two enantiomers.

The seeming preclusion of higher doses of R pramipexole can be demonstrated by reference to a theoretical 50 mg tablet. Assuming a 9 times difference in binding affinities a 50 mg tablet which is 99.95 pure would have approximately 5.575 DAE 5.55 DAE from the R pramipexole and 0.025 DAE from the S pramipexole . Similarly a 25 mg tablet would be expected to exhibit a DAE of 2.79 2.78 from the It pramipexole and 0.0125 DAE from the S pramipexole . The MTD of S pramipexole after a seven week titration regimen is 4.5 mg or 1.5 mg three times a day which is equivalent to a 4.5 DAE in a day or 1.5 DAE in a single dose. Further the NOAEL dose amount for S pramipexole is below 1.5 mg preferably below 0.50 mg or more preferably below 0.05 mg which are each equivalent to 1.5 DAE 0.5 DAE and 0.05 DAE respectively. Given that the single dose MTD for S pramipexole has 1.5 DAE and the NOAEL of S pramipexole has less than about 1.5 DAE a single dosage of 50 mg with a DAE of 5.55 and a single dosage of 25 mg with a DAE of 2.79 would be precluded when referring solely to the literature derived comparative binding affinity ratios. Further use of a high chiral purity of 99.95 as used in these theoretical dosages would result in unacceptably high DAEs of 5.55 and 2.79 beyond the single dosage MTD DAE of 1.5 mg and far beyond the preferable NOAELs of 0.5 DAE and 0.05 DAE.

To the contrary in some embodiments an aspect of the present invention involves unexpectedly high chiral purities that have been attained. These purities have led to MTDs or NOAELs for R pramipexole which are higher than previously appreciated based on the literature derived comparative binding affinities. In some embodiments the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions starting doses method of treatment and kits comprising R pramipexole of high chiral purity. Pursuant the discussion above a 25 mg dosage with a similar chiral purity of 99.95 would be predicted to be well above the MTD or NOAEL for S pramipexole and therefore result in observable adverse side effects. Studies in dogs however suggest that the high chiral purity R pramipexole results in NOAEL dose amounts unexpectedly than those that may have been appreciated Table 10 . Incredibly a 25 mg kg dosage of R pramipexole with no detectable amount of S pramipexole 0.05 limit of detection resulted in no observable effects in dogs which is unexpected based on the literature binding affinity data.

Further the studies in dogs demonstrate the high approaching absolute chiral purity of the pramipexole compositions for the R enantiomer. R pramipexole is administered in high dose levels in the studies disclosed herein equivalent to human doses of 1.000 mg to 3 000 mg see Examples so that even the smallest amount of S pramipexole would contribute to the observed NOAEL and MTD. For example with reference to human equivalence doses based on data obtained in dogs the MTP for the R enantiomer has been shown to be equivalent to about 3 000 mg for a 70 kg human subject while the equivalent MTD for the S enantiomer would be equivalent to only 0.30 mg for that same subject Table II . That is a difference of 10 000 fold. The NOAEL dose for the R enantiomer is 20 000 fold greater than for the S enantiomer Table 11 . Thus the R pramipexole compositions used in these studies must be at least 99.99 pure if one were to assume that the observed side effects stemmed only from contamination by the S enantiomer. On the other hand these data demonstrate the high dose levels of the R enantiomer of pramipexole that may be administered safely. This data highlights the usefulness of the high chiral purity for the R enantiomer of pramipexole in various embodiments of the present invention.

The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions starting doses methods and kits comprising R pramipexole with higher dosages and higher chiral purities. As discussed above the literature previously suggested that the comparative binding affinity ratios at the Dand Dreceptors were approximately 9 to 21 and 50 respectively See Example 1 and Table 10 below . It has been unexpectedly found that the comparative binding affinity ratios of S R at the Dand Dreceptors are approximately 290 and 649 when using high chiral purity R pramipexole.

As is discussed in greater detail below this suggests that the comparative binding affinity ratios are about 13 to 32 times the comparative binding affinity ratios reported in the literature. The literature is replete with discussion of the adverse impact of S pramipexole. Although the in vitro data and binding affinity is presented in support of the present invention is compelling the importance of an economical and efficient synthesis becomes apparent when comparing the in vitro and in vivo data presented herein. The in vivo clinical observations in beagle dogs indicate that the MTD dose ratio of R pramipexole to S pramipexole is 10 000 while the NOAEL dose ratio of R pramipexole to S pramipexole is 20 000. The absolute MTD dose ratio may be higher because the chiral purities reported herein are limited to level of detection See Example 2 and Table 11 . Based on the chiral purity and the in vitro comparative binding affinity ratios clinical NOAEL dose ratios or clinical MTD dose ratios herein comparative ratios it is now possible to predict the DAE for a given dosage of R pramipexole. Table 1 shows the DAE for a 25 mg dose of R pramipexole as a function of comparative ratio and chiral purity. These data show that a much lower DAE can unexpectedly result from a 25 mg dosage form of R pramipexole than may have been previously appreciated due to the lower comparative ratios described herein when compared to the literature derived comparative ratios.

Table 1 attempts to illustrate the importance of both purity and affinity on even a 25 mg single oral dosage. Assumptions regarding dopaminergic activity of the R pramipexole at the dopamine receptors would seemingly preclude even a high purity even 100 pure 25 mg R pramipexole tablet. Based upon the disclosure of the present invention one can immediately envisage numerous tables to illustrate the point. Tables 1A and 1B below are intended to illustrate the importance of purity for a single oral dosage form of R pramipexole by illustrating the impact of even the smallest contamination of the composition by S pramipexole

No one has appreciated or articulated that synthetic methodology was necessary to achieve purities that exceed typical detection limits. Further no one has suggested this single dosage must be 99.95 or greater in purity to be suitable for its intended purpose.

Based on the comparative ratios for binding affinity NOAEL and MTD values it is then possible to predict the amount of R pramipexole that could be administered which would be equivalent to a non effective dose amount of the S pramipexole. Table 2 shows DAE as a function of a dosage of R pramipexole left hand column and the comparative ratio top row . With reference to Table 2 a unit dose can be chosen which allows for an amount of R pramipexole having DAE which is equal to the non effective amount of S pramipexole. Indeed unless a dual DAE NAE effect is desired a DAE would be avoided or minimized in a pharmaceutical composition. Thus any single dose greater than 25 milligrams would not be expected to avoid off target activity and would be expressly avoided by one skilled in the art. This is not true if as in present invention the comparative ratios exceed 200. This is best illustrated by Table 2.

Similarly one can ascertain the amount of R pramipexole that could be administered which would be equivalent to a no observable adverse effect level dose amount of the S pramipexole. Table 3 shows DAE as a function of a dosage of R pramipexole left hand column and the comparative ratio top row . With reference to Table 3 a unit dose can be chosen which allows for an amount of R pramipexole having a DAE equal to the NOAEL dose amount of S pramipexole. While 0.125 avoids unwanted effects less than 0.05 avoids NOAEL. The difference in literature report and actual results is even more striking in Table 3.

Further Table 4 shows DAE as a function of a dosage of R pramipexole left hand column and the comparative ratio top row . With reference to Table 4 a unit dose can be chosen which allows a dose amount of R pramipexole having a particular DAE.

The higher comparative ratios described herein further suggest that a given dose of R pramipexole can contain a certain amount of S pramipexole impurity before exceeding the acceptable DAE. For example Table 3 shows that a 25 mg dose of R pramipexole results in 0.00125 DAE at a comparative ratio of 20 000 as suggested by the NOAEL ratio of R pramipexole to S pramipexole in the dog studies assuming a 100 chiral purity of R pramipexole. Theoretically an additional 1.4 mg of S pramipexole could be added without exceeding the DAE for a single dose MTD of S pramipexole while an additional 0.045 mg of S pramipexole could be added before exceeding the preferable NOAEL dose amount of S pramipexole. These compositions would be 96 pure and 99.8 pure. By contrast a 25 mg of 100 pure R pramipexole would result in 2.78 DAE using the comparative binding affinity ratio of 9 from the literature suggesting that even 100 purity would be insufficient to avoid adverse side effects. Hence the present invention further provides particular doses of R pramipexole which unexpectedly tolerate small amounts of S pramipexole impurities.

In some embodiments the compositions which comprise R pramipexole may be effective as inhibitors of oxidative stress inhibitors of lipid peroxidation in the detoxification of oxygen radicals and the normalization of mitochondrial function. Oxidative stress may be caused by an increase in oxygen and other free radicals and has been associated with the fatal neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS . ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving the motor neurons of the cortex brain stem and spinal cord. About 10 of all ALS patients are familial eases of which 20 have mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 SOD 1 gene. The SOD 1 enzyme may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis FALS . Recent studies also link the premature neuronal death associated with ALS to mutated mitochondrial genes which lead to abnormalities in functioning of the energy production pathways in mitochondria.

Compositions which comprise R pramipexole may also be effective in the treatment of age related macular degeneration. As such an embodiment of the invention may be a composition comprising R pramipexole suitable for systemic administration ocular administration or topical administration to the eye.

Thus the neuroprotective effect of the compositions of the present invention may derive at least in part from the ability of the R enantiomer of pramipexole to prevent neural cell death by at least one of three mechanisms. First the R enantiomer of pramipexole may be capable of reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species in cells with impaired mitochondrial energy production. Second the R enantiomer of pramipexole may partially restore the reduced mitochondrial membrane potential that has been correlated with Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Third the R enantiomer of pramipexole may block the cell death pathways which are produced by pharmacological models of Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases and mitochondrial impairment.

The compositions of these several embodiments which comprise R pramipexole as an active agent may be effective as inhibitors of oxidative stress inhibitors of lipid peroxidation in the detoxification of oxygen radicals and the normalization of mitochondrial function. Further they may be effective as treatment for impaired motor function and in degenerative diseases that may affect cardiac and striated muscle and retinal tissues. As such they may be effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease and macular degeneration.

The pramipexole salt reaction product displays a high chemical purity and an increased optical purity over the reactants which may be due to limited solubility of the pramipexole salt in the polar solvents of the reaction mixture. Purification of the final pramipexole synthesis product from the reaction mixture thus involves simple trituration and washing of the precipitated pramipexole salt in a volatile solvent such as an alcohol or heptane followed by vacuum drying.

In some embodiments the R pramipexole is prepared by dissolving a diamine of formula 2 6 diamino 4 5 6 7 tetrahydro benzothiazole in an organic solvent reacting the diamine with a propyl sulfonate or a propyl halide under conditions sufficient to generate and precipitate the pramipexole salt and recovering the pramipexole salt. In a preferred embodiment the propyl sulfonate may be propyl tosylate. In a further embodiment the propyl halide may be propyl bromide. The pramipexole salt reaction product of this process displays a high chemical purity and an increased optical purity over the reactants. Without wishing to be bound by theory the increased optical purity may be due to limited solubility of the pramipexole salt reaction product in the polar solvents of the reaction mixture. Purification of the final pramipexole reaction product from the reaction mixture thus involves simple trituration and washing of the precipitated pramipexole salt in a volatile solvent such as an alcohol or heptane followed by vacuum drying.

Alternatively the sulfonate or halide salts of pramipexole may alternatively be converted to the free base form of pramipexole by a second process. In this second process the p TSA salt of pramipexole is dissolved in water and cooled to a temperature of about 10 C. This slurry is basified by addition of NaOH diluted with brine and extracted several times in DCM. The combined organic phases are then washed with brine dried over MgSO filtered and concentrated to dryness. A detailed example of this synthesis may be found in Example 11.

The free base form of pramipexole may be converted to pramipexole dihydrochloride by bubbling HCl gas into a cooled solution of the pramipexole free base in IPAC.

Results of example purifications using each of the several conditions which are embodiments of the present disclosure are listed in Table 8.

The chemical and chiral purity of the preparations of R pramipexole may be verified with at least HPLC C NMR H NMR and FTIR. In preferred embodiments the R pramipexole may be synthesized by the method described above which yields enantiomerically pure material. Alternatively the R pramipexole may be purified from mixtures of R and S pramipexole using a purification scheme which is disclosed in copending U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 894 829 entitled Methods of Synthesizing and Purifying E and S pramipexole filed on Mar. 14 2007 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 894 814 entitled Methods of Enantiomerically Purifying Chiral Compounds filed on Mar. 14 2007 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

By way of explanation and not wishing to be bound by theory the solubility of R pramipexole and S pramipexole may be the same in the trituration step of the synthesis and purification processes. As example if a synthesis process is carried out with 90 grams of the R diamine and 10 grams of the S diamine and the solubility of the final pramipexole product is 10 grams for either enantiomer then 80 grams of the R pramipexole product and 0 grams of the S pramipexole product would precipitate assuming a 100 chemical conversion from the diamine and no change in molecular weight in going to the pramipexole product . That is 10 grams of each enantiomer of pramipexole may be expected to go into solution. This would lead to a pramipexole product with a 100 chiral purity for the R enantiomer. The opposite ratio of starting materials for the synthesis process 90 grams of the S diamine and 10 grams of the R diamine may generate a reaction product of 90 grams of the S pramipexole and 10 grams of the R pramipexole. From this reaction product mixture 80 grams of the S enantiomer and 0 grams of the R enantiomer of pramipexole would be expected to precipitate leading to a pramipexole product with a 100 chiral purity for the S enantiomer. In this thought experiment one can imagine that the volumes which are used for a reaction may have a large potential effect on the final yield and chiral purity. That is too large a volume will reduce the yield as more of the pramipexole enantiomer products will go into solution but increase the chiral purity and too small a volume will increase the yield as less of the pramipexole products will go into solution but reduce the chiral purity .

To better define the actual limits of the reaction volumes and optical purities attainable using methods of the disclosure various ratios of chiral purity for the starting diamine material were tested. As shown in Table 9 the synthesis and purification process was tested using the following ratios of the starting R and S diamine 80 20 20 80 85 15 15 85 90 10 10 90 95 5 and 5 95. Additionally three specific reaction conditions were tested which varied either the reaction volume or a post reaction recovery step. These trials demonstrated that the enantiomers of pramipexole are equally insoluble or soluble in the organic solvents utilized in the various embodiments of the synthesis processes disclosed herein.

The data in Table 9 demonstrate that both enantiomers of pramipexole have similar if not the same solubility. Further the data show that the synthesis is equally efficient for either enantiomer of pramipexole. These data also demonstrate that the enantiomers behave independently of one another in that the solubility of one enantiomer appears to be unaffected by the concentration in solution of the other. For example the various synthesis reactions carried out using condition C all have chemical yields of about 50 independent of the percentage of predominant diamine enantiomer of the starting material. When the volume of the organic solvent used in the synthesis reaction is increased the chemical yield is reduced but the chiral yield is increased. This is apparent by comparison of the reaction carried out in conditions C and D where an 85 15 ratio of R S diamine produced a pramipexole product having an 86.8 chiral purity for the R enantiomer when the reaction used 10 volumes of the organic solvent and a 99.8 chiral purity for the R enantiomer when the reaction used 18 volumes of the organic solvent. Note also that the chemical yield was reduced in the reaction using a larger volume of organic solvent 43 yield in condition C and 36 yield in condition D .

In Table 9 condition E is the same as condition C except that the recovery step does not incorporate dilution in MTBE. The MTBE is observed to increase pramipexole recovery yield from the synthesis reaction but may reduce the overall chiral purity. This is born out by a comparison of the results for trials carried out in an 85 15 ratio of R S diamine which produced a pramipexole product having a 86.8 chiral purity for the R enantiomer when the reaction included the MTBE organic solvent and a 99.9 chiral purity for the R enantiomer when the reaction did not include the MTBE organic solvent. The chemical yield was reduced by exclusion of the MTBE dilution in the recovery step a 43 yield in condition C as opposed to a 39 yield in condition E.

The chirally pure R pramipexole prepared by any of the above methods may be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of R pramipexole. For example R pramipexole dihydrochloride is a preferred pharmaceutical salt due its high water solubility. R pramipexole dihydrochloride may be prepared from other salts of R pramipexole in a one step method comprising reacting the R pramipexole or R pramipexole salt with concentrated HCl in an organic solvent such as an alcohol at a reduced temperature. In some embodiments the reduced temperature is a temperature of from about 0 C. to about 5 C. An organic solvent such as methyl tert butyl ether may be added and the reaction may be stirred for an additional hour. The R pramipexole dihydrochloride product may be recovered from the reaction mixture by filtering washing with an alcohol and vacuum drying.

Each of the methods disclosed herein for the manufacture and purification of R pramipexole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be scalable to provide industrial scale quantities and yields supplying products with both high chemical and chiral purity. In some embodiments the enantiomerically pure R pramipexole may be manufactured in large batch quantities as may be required to meet the needs of a large scale pharmaceutical use.

Various aspects of the present invention will be illustrated with reference to the following non limiting examples.

The S enantiomer of pramipexole has historically been characterized as a high affinity dopamine receptor ligand at the D both the S and L isoforms Dand Dreceptors although the highest affinity is seen for the Dreceptor subtype. The dopamine receptor ligand affinity of S pramipexole and of R pramipexole from journal publications has been tabulated data are reproduced in Table 10 . Although the conditions under which each study or experiment was carried out are slightly different and different radio ligands were used the data show comparable affinities for the various dopamine receptors. Studies we conducted on the dopamine receptor affinities of the S and the R enantiomers of pramipexole are also shown in Table 10. These data demonstrate an unexpectedly large difference in the affinities of the two enantiomers of pramipexole for all dopamine receptors. Table 10 shows that instead of the expected 10 20 fold difference in binding affinity for D2 receptor affinity and 50 fold difference in binding affinity for D3 receptor affinity as derived from the literature the values we found were typically 10 fold higher 290 and 649 fold respectively Table 10 .

Ale R pramipexole and S pramipexole were supplied as dry powder to our contract research partner Cerep by the manufacturer AMRI. Solutions of R pramipexole and S pramipexole were prepared from stock solutions in DMSO. Eight concentrations of R pramipexole or S pramipexole 0.01 nM 0.1 nM 1 nM 10 nM 100 nM 100 mM 10 mM and 100 mM were used to displace standard reference radiolabeled dopamine agonists. These concentrations were tested in cell lines expressing select human cloned dopamine receptors D D . Previous work in the literature and our data demonstrated no significant interaction with D1 and D5 dopamine receptors. Group results for the interaction of R pramipexole or S pramipexole with each receptor are expressed as the IC50 in Table 10.

These data indicate that ICvalues of R pramipexole at these receptors are approximately 290 to 649 times that of the ICvalues for S pramipexole. Further these data suggest that the ratio of the ICvalues for R pramipexole to S pramipexole at the Dreceptor are approximately 14 to 32 times larger than the ratios suggested by the literature at least when the chiral purities were beyond the limits of detection LOD 0.05 chiral purity greater than 99.95 . Similarly the data suggest that the ratio of the IC values for R pramipexole to S pramipexole at the Dreceptor are approximately 13 times larger than the ratios suggested by the literature at least when the chiral purities were beyond the limits of detection chiral purity greater than 99.95 . These data also suggest that if dopamine receptor affinity is the major contributing factor to limiting dose tolerance of the S enantiomer then pure preparations of the R enantiomer should have a maximum tolerated dose MTD and or a no observable adverse effect level dose NOAEL of at least 290 times greater than the S enantiomer s MTD and or NOAEL. Thus even a small contamination of the R pramipexole compositions of the present invention by the S enantiomer at levels as low as 0.5 or less may effect the observed MTD and NOEL.

In vivo studies to determine the MTD and NOAEL in dogs for 100 pure preparations of the R and S enantiomers of pramipexole and a mixture R 99.5 S 0.5 . The form of R pramipexole was R pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate.

The following in vivo study in beagle dogs was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the large observed difference in receptor binding affinities for the R and S enantiomers of pramipexole will translate to a large observed difference in the observed maximum tolerated dose MTP and or no observable adverse effect level NOAEL of the two enantiomers. Dogs were administered preparations of each enantiomer prepared as a highly purified compound 100 pure preparations within the limits of analytical detectability or a preparation of the R enantiomer contaminated by 0.5 of the S enantiomer of pramipexole.

Three groups of four non na ve male beagle dogs were used in the study. Each group was administered various doses of either the R or S enantiomer prepared as a highly purified compound or a preparation of the R enantiomer contaminated by 0.5 of the S enantiomer of pramipexole. Doses were administered orally by gavage and clinical observations were taken continuously following dosing hourly for the first four hours and then twice daily cage side observations for the duration of the inter dose or post dose interval. Observations were made of clinical signs mortality injury and availability of food and water. Animals were lasted for 24 hr prior to dosing. Dogs in each group were exposed to only one drug or the combination each dose was administered only once with a subsequent dose administered after a recovery period of 4 days. The data are summarized in Table 11.

A NOAEL was established at a dose level of 25 mg kg for the R enantiomer when administered to non na ve dogs while a dose level of 75 mg kg may be considered an MTD in non na ve dogs. For the S enantiomer a NOAEL of 0.00125 mg kg and an MTD of 0.0075 mg kg was found in non na ve dogs. For the composition containing a mixture of the two enantiomers 99.5 R pramipexole and 0.5 S pramipexole the NOAEL was found to be 0.25 mg kg which corresponds to a dose of 00125 mg kg of the S enantiomer while the MTD is 1.5 mg kg which corresponds to a dose of 0.0075 mg kg of the S enantiomer. These data indicate that the NOAEL for the R enantiomer of pramipexole is approximately 20 000 fold greater than for the S enantiomer in non na ve dogs while the MTD is about 10 000 fold greater.

The data shown in Table 11 indicate that the receptor affinities identified see Table 10 contribute in a straightforward fashion to the observed differences in the MTD and NOAEL doses for the R and S enantiomers of pramipexole. These data also indicate that the chiral purity for the R enantiomer of pramipexole in embodiments of the compositions of the present invention refer to Tables 5 and 6 may need to be in excess of 99.9 depending on the final total dose to avoid the adverse side effects of S pramipexole.

Further the data in Table 11 demonstrate that the NOAEL and MTD for the combination composition 99.5 R pramipexole and 0.5 S pramipexole may be determined directly by the dose of the S enantiomer in the composition. Thus a small fractional percentage contamination of a composition of R pramipexole by the S enantiomer may reduce the MTD and NOEL of the composition. For example in these experiments the MTD of pramipexole was reduced from 75 mg kg for the R enantiomer to a total dose of 1.5 mg kg of the mixed composition a factor of 50 and the NOAEL was reduced from 25 mg kg to 0.25 mg kg respectively a factor of 100 . Since the shift in MTD and NOAEL may be predicted by the dose of the S enantiomer of pramipexole in the mixture the shift for any unknown mixture may be calculated based on the percentage contamination of the R pramipexole by the S enantiomer relative to the MTD and NOAEL for S pramipexole. This indicates that any contamination of an R pramipexole dosing solution with S pramipexole will have a measurable effect on these indicators of dose tolerability.

Toxicology studies in rats and minipigs and Phase I studies in healthy adult volunteers. Two week and three month toxicology studies of R pramipexole in rats and minipigs were completed. NOAEL dose levels of 150 mg kg at two weeks and 100 mg kg at three months for rats and 75 mg kg at two weeks and 50 mg kg at three months for minipigs were established. Phase I studies of healthy adult volunteers have demonstrated that R pramipexole in ascending single doses up to 300 mg and multiple doses up to 200 mg per day for 4 days is safe and well tolerated. The Mirapex label specifies a starting dose of 0.125 mg and a maximum total daily dose of 4.5 mg. The Phase I data demonstrate therefore that R pramipexole may be safely administered 1 at starting doses that are at least 2400 fold higher than the Mirapex starting dose and 2 at steady state doses that are at least 44 fold higher than the highest recommended dose of Mirapex. The form of R pramipexole was R pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate.

The preliminary results of the clinical studies and the toxicology studies are discussed. Exposure at steady state in rats minipigs and humans is linear across all doses studied. After 3 months of dosing the current No Observed Adverse Effect Level NOAEL in rats has been determined to be 100 mg kg and the current NOAEL in minipigs has been determined to be 50 mg kg. The mean steady state AUC in rats at the NOAEL dose of 100 mg kg was 61 299 and 61 484 h ng mL for males and females respectively and for minipigs at the NOAEL dose of 50 mg kg was 91 812 and 131 731 h ng mL for males and females respectively. The mean steady state AUC in humans at a dose of 100 mg Q12H 200 mg total daily dose was 2 574 h ng mL. The drug has been safe well tolerated and free of clinically significant adverse events in healthy adult subjects at single doses up to 300 mg and at multiple doses up to 100 mg Q12H and the projected human exposure associated with a daily dose of 250 mg Q12H is expected to be greater than 13 fold lower than exposures seen at the NOAEL in male minipigs and approximately 9 fold lower than exposures seen at the NOAEL in male and female rats after 13 weeks of dosing.

3.2 Clinical Studies. R pramipexole has been studied at single daily doses of 50 150 and 300 mg and twice daily doses of 50 and 100 mg for 4 days in healthy adult volunteers. The drug has been safe and well tolerated in both studies and there were no serious adverse events discontinuations due to adverse events or dose related or clinically significant adverse events in either study. The most frequent adverse events have been dizziness and headache all of which have been mild to moderate in severity and resolved without intervention.

3.2.1 Summary of Blinded Safety and Pharmacokinetic Results of R pramipexole Ascending Single Dose Study . Three sequential panels of 8 subjects each received single doses of R pramipexole 6 subjects or placebo 2 subjects at ascending dose levels of 50 150 and 300 mg. Safety observations included vital signs physical examination clinical laboratory tests ECGs and adverse event reporting. Blood and urine samples were collected pre dose and for 72 hours post dose to assess the pharmacokinetics. All 24 subjects completed the study as planned. There were no serious adverse events 46 of all subjects reported at least one non serious adverse event AE . Most AEs were mild the most frequent AE was mild dizziness in 21 of subjects. There were no clinically significant safety observations at any dose level.

Pharmacokinetic data indicated that R pramipexole is rapidly absorbed with mean maximum concentrations of 125 360 and 781 ng mL reached at approximately 2 hours post dose for the 50 150 and 300 mg dose groups respectively see and Table 12 below . Mean exposures AUC were 1254 3815 and 8623 h ng mL for the 50 150 and 300 mg dose groups respectively. Both Cand AUC increased in proportion to dose across the dose levels tested. Urinary excretion of unchanged drug accounted for approximately 70 of drug elimination across dose levels. The mean Twas 6 7 hours and was independent of dose. Comparison of the mean plasma concentrations and mean pharmacokinetic parameters Table 12 after administration of a single 150 mg following a high fat high calorie breakfast with those after administration of 150 mg under fasted conditions demonstrates essentially no effect of a meal on the absorption and elimination of R pramipexole.

Results of this study demonstrate that single oral doses of 50 150 and 300 mg R pramipexole are safe and well tolerated. The drug is orally bioavailable and the pharmacokinetics are linear. Absorption and elimination are not affected by a high fat high calorie meal.

3.2.2 Summary of Blinded Safety and Pharmacokinetic Results of R pramipexole Ascending Multiple Dose Study . This study is ongoing and has not yet been unblinded with respect to treatment assignments and only clinical observations and pharmacokinetic data are available for the first 2 panels. To date 2 sequential panels of 8 subjects each were enrolled to receive multiple doses of R pramipexole 6 subjects or placebo 2 subjects . The first panel was administered a singe dose of 50 mg followed 48 hours later by 4 days of multiple dosing twice daily at 50 mg Q12 hours. The second panel was administered a singe dose of 100 mg followed 48 hours later by 4 days of multiple dosing twice daily at 100 mg Q12 hours. Safety observations included vital signs physical examination clinical laboratory tests ECGs and adverse event reporting. Blood samples were collected pre dose on Day 1 and serially for 48 hours post dose to assess the single dose pharmacokinetics. Blood samples were collected pre dose on Days 5 6 and 7 to confirm steady state was achieved and serially through 72 hours post dose on Day 7 to assess the steady state pharmacokinetics of R pramipexole. Urine samples were collected for 12 hours after dosing on Day 7 to assess urinary excretion.

All 16 subjects enrolled to date have completed the study as planned. There were no deaths reports of serious adverse events or discontinuations because of adverse events during the study. Both dose levels were well tolerated. In cohort 1 all adverse events were mild in intensity with the exception of moderate headaches reported by 2 subjects. In cohort 2 all adverse events were mild in intensity with the exception of moderate stiffness in back and a moderate vasovagal response reported in 1 subject. An asymptomatic mild increase in heart rate upon standing without change in blood pressure was reported by the principal investigator for 1 of the 8 subjects dosed in cohort 1 50 mg cohort and for 2 of the 8 subjects dosed in cohort 2 100 mg cohort . There were no clinically significant safety observations at any dose level.

Pharmacokinetic data are shown in Table 13 and . Cand AUC increased 37 and 40 respectively from Day 1 to Day 7 for subjects receiving 50 mg Q12H with essentially no change in T. Mean exposure AUCat Day 7 was 1449 h ng mL for the 50 mg Q12H dose group. Cand AUCincreased 24 and 38 respectively from Day 1 to Day 7 for subjects receiving 100 mg Q12H with essentially no change in T. Mean exposure AUCat Day 7 was 2465 h ng mL for the 100 mg Q12H dose group. Results of this study demonstrate that multiple oral doses of 50 and 100 mg R pramipexole administered twice daily are safe and well tolerated. The drug is orally bioavailable and the pharmacokinetics are linear at steady state with no significant accumulation.

3.3 Toxicology Studies. In a 2 week repeat dose toxicology studies in rats animals received 50 150 and 500 mg kg doses of R pramipexole for 14 days. R pramipexole caused mortality at the high dose of 500 mg kg and statistically significant changes in body weight gain and food consumption for both sexes were observed in the animals surviving to terminal sacrifice. No target organ toxicity by histopathology examination was identified at any dose. The NOAEL for this 2 week study in rats was determined to be 150 mg kg. Following this study 3 and 6 month repeat dose toxicology studies were completed at doses of 30 100 and 300 mg kg. The results of the 3 month study contain some target organ toxicity by histopathology examination at the highest dose 300 mg kg with no test article related deaths and no significant clinical observations outside of several incidences of convulsions in high dose rats lasting approximately 2 minutes. The animals health did not appear to be otherwise adversely affected by these convulsions. Test article related microscopic changes were observed in the liver minimal grade cholestasis correlating with increased total bilirubin ileal small intestine minimal grade mineralization and thymus minimal grade lymphoid depletion correlating with lower group thymus weights compared to controls . The NOAEL for the 3 month study in rats is considered to be 100 mg kg. Systemic exposure AUC at week 13 at the NOAEL dose of 100 mg kg was 61 299 h ng mL in males and 61 484 h ng mL in females. The in life phase of the 6 month toxicology study in rats was recently completed and histopatholgic examinations are pending. There were no mortalities at any dose level between the 13 week and 26 week sacrifices.

In a 2 week repeat dose toxicology study in minipigs animals received 7.5 25 and 75 mg kg doses of R pramipexole for 14 days. No target organ toxicity by histopathology examination was identified at any dose. Clinical observations included salivation decreased activity emesis and inappetance with higher incidences of emesis in females than males and mostly in the 75 mg kg group. The incidence of emesis at 75 mg kg at least one episode in 5 of 8 animals dosed at 75 ng kg suggested this dose is close to the limit of tolerability for R pramipexole for chronic dosing in minipigs. Since no test article related toxicological changes were observed at the high dose the NOAEL for the 2 week study was considered to be greater than or equal to 75 mg kg. Based on this study 3 and 6 and 9 month repeat dose studies of R pramipexole in minipigs were initiated at dose levels of 7.5 25 and 75 mg kg. At month 2 dose levels were reduced to 7.5 25 and 50 mg kg due to mortalities at the 75 mg kg level. The 3 and 6 month repeat dose studies have now been completed at the 7.5 25 and 50 mg kg dose levels and the 9 month repeat dose study is ongoing. No target organ toxicity by histopathology examination was identified at any dose level following animal sacrifice after 3 months of exposure. The NOAEL for the 3 month study in minipigs is considered to be 50 mg kg. Systemic exposure AUC0 24 at week 13 at the NOAEL dose of 50 mg kg day was 91 812 h ng mL in males and 131 731 h ng mL in females. The in life phase of the 6 month toxicology study in minipigs was recently completed and histopatholgic examinations are pending. There were no mortalities attributed to test article or significant clinical observations at any dose level between the 13 week and 26 week sacrifices. The ongoing 9 month toxicology studies in minipigs have now passed month 7 and no deaths attributed to test article or significant clinical observations have occurred at any dose level.

3.4. Human Dosages. The development of R pramipexole as a treatment of ALS is based on a maximally tolerated dose strategy derived either from tolerability or safety data from studies in humans or from the results of animal toxicology studies. To date there have been no dose limiting tolerability observations in humans. Therefore in order to progress dosing in humans it is necessary to closely examine the exposure at which toxicity has been observed in rats and minipigs. Pharmacokinetic data obtained to date suggest that pharmacokinetics in humans will continue to be dose proportional at higher doses and that the accumulation factor will be constant. Safety and toxicokinetic results from the 3 month toxicology studies in rats and minipigs show no adverse effects of chronic dosing up to 100 mg kg in rats and 50 mg kg in minipigs. Analysis of safety margins in R pramipexole exposure between the NOAEL for minipigs and the projections of human exposure therefore support progression of total daily doses up to 500 mg in humans. The projected steady state exposure of R pramipexole at a total daily dose of 500 mg administered as 250 mg Q12H is approximately 7 000 h ng mL which is greater than 13 fold lower than exposures seen at the NOAEL in male minipigs and approximately 9 fold lower than exposures seen at the NOAEL in male and female rats after 13 weeks of dosing.

Exposure at steady state in rats minipigs and humans is linear across all doses studied. After 3 months of dosing the NOAEL in rats has been determined to be 100 mg kg and the NOAEL in minipigs has been determined to be 50 mg kg. The mean AUC in rats at the NOAEL was 61 299 and 61 484 h ng mL for males and females respectively and for minipigs was 91 812 and 131 731 h ng mL for males and females respectively. The mean AUC in humans at steady state at a dose of 100 mg Q12H 200 mg total daily dose was 2 574 h ng mL.

Preparation of Capsules with R pramipexole. R pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate is filled in hard gelatin capsules with no excipients. The capsules used for the drug product are 00 blue opaque gelatin capsules from Hawkins Chemical Group. Dose strengths of 50 and 500 mg are produced. Matching placebo capsules are filled with microcrystalline cellulose. Capsules are prepared by weighing individual empty capsules and recording the weight W . Specified amount of active drug substance are individually weighed and hand filled into a capsule bottom using a Torpac filling funnel. A purity adjustment factor of 1.0638 is used to adjust for the water weight monohydrate in the salt form i.e. a 50 mg dose should have a target fill of 50 1.0638 53.16 mg. Capsule tops are joined with the filled capsule bottom. The filled capsules are then weighed and the weight is recorded W . The calculated weight of the drug substance in the capsule W W is recorded. If this calculated weight is within 5 of the nominal weight then the capsule is cleaned polished and placed into and appropriately labeled container. If the calculated weight is outside of the specified range the capsule is discarded. The free base weight per capsule free base weight per mg of capsule contents multiplied by till weight is 90 to 100 of the calculated label claim. Total impurities are 2 . The appearance is a blue capsule containing white to off white powder.

Preparation of Tablets with R pramipexole. Capsules with 125 mg dose strength are prepared with the composition shown in Table 17. Capsules are generally prepared under conditions of 60 to 74 F. and a relative humidity of 30 to 60 . Microcrystalline cellulose mannitol crospovidone magnesium stearate and R pramipexole milled are weighed out in the amounts shown in the column Quantity batch in Table 14. The microcrystalline cellulose mannitol crospovidone and R pramipexole are then hand screened through a 20 mesh stainless steel screen and transferred to a Maxiblend V blender with a 4 quart shell. The materials are then mixed using the Maxiblend V blender for 10 minutes. The magnesium stearate is then screened using a 30 mesh stainless steel hand screen and transferred to the blender. The powders are then mixed for five minutes. The final blend is then emptied into a labeled double PE lined drum and the gross tare and net weights are recorded.

Tablets are prepared using a Minipress II B with 5 stations of round standard concave tooling and gravity feed frame. The final blend is placed in the hopper and the tablet press set up is run according to the specifications in Table 15.

The present invention provides evidence that the dopamine receptor affinity of R pramipexole is actually much lower than previously appreciated. In a study using beagle dogs presented herein it has been shown that the functional separation between the S pramipexole and R pramipexole enantiomers 10 000 20 000 fold is much greater than previously expected. These data also show that contamination of the composition of pure R pramipexole with small known amounts of S pramipexole results in a predictable shift in the MTD of the composition. These data demonstrate that R pramipexole can be dosed at levels that can more fully and unexpectedly exploit the lower potency neuroprotective potential of the compound without the theoretical MTD limitation previously assumed and without the need for dose titration. The application presents methods for using pure compositions of R pramipexole in acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders previously inaccessible to this drug and immediately at full strength without dose titration and at higher theoretical MTDs. Additionally the data showing that a pure composition of R pramipexole can be mixed with a known amount of S pramipexole to produce dopamine receptor agonist effects determined solely by the contribution of the S enantiomer allows for the use of compositions comprising the mixture of known amounts of pure R and S enantiomers for use in neurodegenerative disorders amenable to both dopamine receptor agonist treatment and neuroprotection such as PD.
