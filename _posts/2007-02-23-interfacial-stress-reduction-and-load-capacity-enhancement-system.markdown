title: Interfacial stress reduction and load capacity enhancement system
abstract: An article and a process are provided for reducing the shear stress on an interface of a structural member in intimate contact with a compressive load. The article is in the form of a wedge that is forcibly placed against the sidewall of one end or both ends of the structural member. The wedge may take the form of a ring that can be placed on the inside or outside surface of a hollow cylindrical structural member. The process of forcibly placing a wedge against the sidewall at one or both ends of the structural member produces a transverse compressive stress upon the sidewall. The transverse compressive stress upon the sidewall attenuates the tendency of said sidewall to deflect when the structural member is subjected to a compressive load. A reduction in the deflection of the sidewall reduces the shear stress generated proximal to the interface of the structural member in intimate contact with a compressive load and increases the structural member load bearing capacity.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates in general to a system and a process that applies a compressive stress to a structural member and in particular to a system and process that applies a transverse compressive stress to a structural member and reduces interfacial stresses at a the structural member interface in contact with a compressive load.

Structural members can be placed under significant compressive loads. The use of structural members in bridges buildings maritime and aerospace equipment and munitions can result in catastrophic damage exorbitant cost and even loss of life when such a member fails.

The interface between a structural member and a load supported by said structural member is a critical location with respect to failure. Such interfaces are often the weak link of a complex structure.

Hollow structural members subjected to a compressive load can experience a barreling phenomenon wherein deflection of a structural member sidewall occurs in a lateral direction. This barreling causes deformation to the structural member and can result in shear stresses proximal to the interface between the structural member and the load and or the base in contact with the member. The interfacial shear stresses can be of such magnitude that failure of the structural member results.

Metal matrix composite materials for example an aluminum alloy matrix with ceramic fibers therein provide a substantial weight savings and improved structural integrity over current traditional structural materials such as steels and aluminum alloys. The weight savings obtained by using metal matrix composite materials can immediately be reinvested into other areas of concern particularly in situations where a weight to strength ratio is critical such as aerospace and munition applications. Therefore metal matrix composite materials continue to be tested and used in an increasing number of commercial industrial and military applications. However the use of a metal matrix composite material as a structural member can create a problem with respect to joining the member to the load it supports with traditional joining methods such as welding bolting screwing etc. proving difficult if not impossible. With the difficulty of joining a metal matrix composite structural member to another member in a given structure interfacial integrity becomes an even more important issue.

Therefore given the criticality of structural member interfaces and the loads said members support there is a need for an article and a process that reduces the interfacial stresses occurring at interfacial locations.

A system is provided for the reduction of shear stress at a hollow structural member interface. The system is in the form of a wedge that is forcibly placed against the sidewall at one end or both ends of a structural member subjected to a compressive load. The wedge may take the form of a ring or ring segments and can be used with a supporting block or at least one other wedge in order to produce a transverse compressive force on the sidewall of the structural member. The system also provides for a fastening joint that supports tensile loads.

A process for reducing the shear stress at a hollow structural member interface includes forcibly placing a wedge against the sidewall at one or both ends of a structural member subjected to a compressive load. Forcibly plabing the wedge against the sidewall of the structural member produces a transverse compressive stress on the sidewall. The transverse compressive stress on the sidewall attenuates the tendency of the sidewall to deflect in a lateral direction when the structural member is placed under a compressive load. By reducing the deflection of the sidewall the transverse compressive stress reduces the shear stress proximal to the interface of the structural member that is in intimate contact with the compressive load and increases its load bearing capacity. Reducing the interfacial shear stresses of the structural member increases the safety and reliability of the structural member and the entire structure.

The present invention has utility as a system and a process for reducing interfacial shear stresses proximal to a structural member interface in physical contact with a compressive load. Representative manifestations of the present invention include reducing shear stresses at structural member interfaces in bridges buildings maritime and aerospace equipment and munitions.

Referring now to an inventive process is applied to a structural member shown generally at . The structural member is readily formed of any material conventional to the art such materials operative herein illustratively including metals alloys plastics and composites. A transverse compressive force is applied to a structural member sidewall of the member . The structural member has a first end separated from a second end by the sidewall . An interface is located at the first end of the structural member and an interface is located at the second end . The interface is in physical contact with a base and the interface is in physical contact with a longitudinal compressive load . The longitudinal compressive load as used herein is defined as a compressive load applied to a structural member along a direction normal to an interface in physical contact with either the load or a base supporting the member and the load.

The longitudinal compressive load produces a deflection of the sidewall in a first direction . Deflection of the sidewall in the first direction creates a shear stress proximal to the interfaces and . The inventive process applies the transverse compressive force in the first direction to attenuate the tendency of the sidewall to deflect in the first direction . Decreasing the deflection of the sidewall in the first direction reduces the shear stress proximal to the structural member interfaces and . The reduction of the interfacial shear stress decreases the likelihood of failure proximal to the interfaces and and increases the load bearing capacity of the structural member .

The system includes at least one wedge not shown in with the wedge transmitting the transverse compressive force to the sidewall of the structural member . The wedge is readily formed of any material conventional to the art such materials operative herein illustratively including metals alloys plastics and composites. It is appreciated that factors involved in the selection of a wedge material include but are not be limited to the compatibility of the wedge material with the structural member and the toughness corrosion resistance and weldability of the wedge material.

In a preferred embodiment the present invention includes the use of the system and the process to apply the transverse compressive force before the longitudinal compressive load is applied. This preloading at an appropriate location attenuates the tendency of the structural member sidewall to barrel when subjected to the longitudinal compressive load . However applying the transverse compressive force to the structural member sidewall after the longitudinal compressive load has been applied is effective in reducing the interfacial shear stress .

Referring now to an exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown generally at . A hollow cylindrical structural member is positioned on a base . Preferably the hollow cylinder is an artillery aeroshell. An aeroshell is an outer structural skin of a modern artillery projectile that provides a low drag protection vehicle for the complex inner warhead and related components. It will be understood however that this is by way of example only and that any hollow cylindrical structural member may benefit from the system and process of the present invention.

The hollow cylindrical structural member has a first end and a second end . The first end is separated from the second end by the sidewall . The sidewall has an inside surface and an outside surface . An interface is located at the first end of the sidewall and is in physical contact with the base . Likewise an interface is located at the second end of the sidewall and is in physical contact with the longitudinal compressive load . The longitudinal compressive load on the hollow cylindrical structural member causes deflection of the sidewall in the first direction .

The base has a top surface a bottom surface and an aperture . The top surface supports the hollow cylindrical structural member and is in physical contact with the interface .

A mating wedge in the form of a ring is located adjacent to the inside surface of the sidewall . It is appreciated that the wedge is optimally provided by one or more ring segments. A wedge surface is preferably parallel to the inside surface . The wedge surface has a relief said relief affording the application of an adhesive to hold the wedge in contact with the inside surface during assembly. In the alternative the wedge surface does not have the relief . A thick end of the wedge is proximal to the interface at the first end of the sidewall . A thin end is oppositely deposed from the thick end thereby resulting in a reduction of the wedge thickness between the thick end and the thin end . The reducing thickness between the thick end and the thin end defines a taper. As shown in the wedge is permanently affixed to the sidewall . In the alternative the wedge is not permanently affixed to the sidewall .

An internal wedge block also known as a driving wedge is located within the hollow cylindrical structural member . It is appreciated that the internal wedge block is optimally provided by one or more wedge block segments. An internal wedge block surface of the internal wedge block preferably matches the taper of the wedge so as to place the internal wedge block surface in parallel with the wedge surface .

The internal wedge block has a top surface a bottom surface and an aperture . A threaded fastener passes through the aperture of the internal wedge block and the aperture of the base . Use of a washer a nut and the threaded fastener affords a pull down force onto the internal wedge block . With the pull down force applied to the internal wedge block the internal wedge block moves in a third direction and the internal wedge block surface is in physical contact with the wedge surface . The internal wedge block surface is preferably parallel to the wedge surface .

As the pull down force increases the wedge action between the internal wedge block and the wedge produces the transverse compressive force in the first direction . The transverse compressive force attenuates the tendency of the sidewall to deflect in the first direction . Reduction of the deflection of the sidewall decreases the shear stress proximal to the interface and increases the load bearing capacity of the hollow cylindrical structural member . It is appreciated that the pull down force the wedge block and the wedge create a fastening joint between the hollow cylindrical structural member and the base . It is also appreciated that the fastening joint supports a tensile load equal to the strength of the threaded fastener .

A preferred embodiment of the present invention uses the threaded fastener with the washer and the nut . Optionally any system producing the pull down force on the internal wedge block is used illustratively including a clamp weight or pry bar system. It is appreciated that the sidewall need not be part of a hollow cylindrical structural member. The sidewall may be a single member for example in the form of a sheet rod or plate acting as a structural member as depicted in . In addition although illustrate the preferred embodiment affording a reduction of interfacial stresses at only on end of the hollow cylindrical structural member the present invention can be used at both ends of the hollow cylindrical structural member .
