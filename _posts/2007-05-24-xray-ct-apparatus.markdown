The present invention relates to an X ray CT apparatus and more particularly it relates to an X ray CT apparatus having a function which decides in advance an X ray condition before starting a scan so as to obtain a contrast to noise ratio appropriate for identifying a diagnostic object.

There are two types of the X ray CT apparatus a single slice X ray CT apparatus for obtaining one tomographic image by one time X ray exposure and a multi slice X ray CT apparatus being able to obtain multiple tomographic images simultaneously.

The single slice X ray CT apparatus employs an X ray detector in which numerous X ray detector elements are arranged in one line i.e. in one dimensional direction channel direction so as to irradiate a fan beam i.e. a fan shaped X ray beam on an object from an X ray tube and measure the X ray that has passed through the object to obtain projection data of the object.

On the other hand the multi slice X ray CT apparatus irradiates a corn beam i.e. a conical or a pyramidal X ray beam from an X ray tube and an X ray detector in which numerous X ray detector elements are arranged in two dimensional directions the channel direction and row direction measures the X ray that has passed through the object to obtain projection data of the object.

In either type of the X ray CT apparatus the X ray tube and the X ray detector opposed to each other are rotated around the object so as to collect projection data from multiple directions. The projection data being collected is subjected to a reconstruction filtering process for deblurring and it is further subjected to back projection to reconstruct a tomographic image of the object.

The projection data is collected at discrete locations hereinafter each referred to as a view of the X ray tube and this collected projection data is referred to as projection data at the view . The number of views per rotation of the X ray tube and the X ray detector for going around the object generally extends from several hundred to several thousand. An action for collecting the projection data of the number of views necessary for reconstructing one piece of CT image is referred to as scan . The projection data corresponding to one view is made up of data in association with the number of channels times the number of rows of the X ray detector described above in the case of the single slice X ray CT apparatus the number of row is equal to 1 as described above .

In the X ray CT apparatus as discussed above in order to identify a diagnostic object within the tomographic image being obtained a contrast to noise ratio Contrast to Noise Ratio hereinafter described as CNR serves as a significant image quality index. The CNR is a value obtained by dividing an absolute value of CT value difference between the diagnostic object and its surroundings by an image noise standard deviation value hereinafter described as image SD Standard Deviation value .

As for the aforementioned image quality index of the X ray CT apparatus increasing of exposure dose generally improves the CNR and produces a good quality image as an image for diagnosis. On the other hand it is desirable to reduce to a minimum the exposure dose to a patient. Considering the situation above the patent document 1 discloses an X ray CT apparatus which improves the CNR in the reconstructed image by using a tube voltage a voltage applied between anode and cathode of the X ray tube lower than conventionally used voltage while not increasing the exposure dose and the image SD value or which reduces the exposure dose by using the tube voltage lower than before while not deteriorating the CNR in the reconstructed image.

However the X ray CT apparatus disclosed in the patent document 1 actually optimizes the X ray condition focusing on the image SD value and does not study sufficiently the relationship between the contrast here an absolute value of the CT value difference or the CNR and the X ray condition. By way of example since the contrast between internal organs is not necessarily dependent on the tube voltage extensively the use of tube voltage lower than before while preventing the image SD value from increasing is not necessarily effective for the CNR enhancement.

In addition it is not clearly described how the processing actually proceeds for allowing the exposure dose to be reduced while keeping the CNR. The CNR to be achieved is different depending on the size of the diagnostic object and therefore the X ray condition to be set is also different. However this point is not discussed in the document either.

In view of the problems above an object of the present invention is to provide an X ray CT apparatus having a function to decide the X ray condition that realizes an appropriate CNR for identifying the diagnostic object.

The present invention decides in advance an X ray condition for obtaining an appropriate contrast to noise ratio to identify the diagnostic object before starting a scan and the scan is done under the decided X ray condition. The present invention is applicable to any scan mode axial scan and spiral scan and any slice type single slice and multi slice . Here an explanation will be made as to the case where the present invention is applied to the X ray CT apparatus of the multi slice type and spiral scan mode.

As shown in the scanner gantry includes an X ray tube for producing X rays being controlled by an X ray controller . The X rays emitted from the X ray tube form for example a pyramidal X ray beam i.e. a corn beam X ray by a collimator that is controlled by a collimator controller and the object is irradiated with this corn beam X ray which passes through the object to be incident on an X ray detector .

As shown in the X ray detector includes multiple X ray detector elements which are arranged two dimensionally in the channel direction and in the row direction. These X ray detector elements are made up of for example a combination of scintillator and photodiode and form a shape as a whole of cylindrical surface or a polygonal line with respect to the channel direction to constitute an X ray incident plane. By way of the example the channel number i ranges approximately from 1 to 1 000 and the row number j ranges approximately from 1 to 1 000. A spread angle of the corn beam X ray in the channel direction which corresponds to the channel array direction of the X ray detector i.e. a fan angle is and a spread angle of the corn beam X ray in the row direction which corresponds to the row array direction of the X ray detector i.e. a corn angle is . The X ray detector is connected to a data collector and this data collector collects detection data from individual X ray detector elements of the X ray detector .

The components described above from the above X ray controller to the data collector are mounted on a rotor plate of the scanner gantry . The rotor plate rotates around the object by a drive force transmitted via a drive force transmitter system from a rotor plate driving device which is controlled by a rotation controller .

As shown in the bed provided with the movable top panel placing the object thereon is configured in such a manner that the bed controller controls a bed vertical transfer device to set the bed at an appropriate height and the bed controller also controls a top panel transfer device to move the top panel back and forth so that the object is brought in and taken out of the X ray irradiation space opening of the scanner gantry .

As shown in in the scanner gantry configured as described above after the object placed on the top panel of the bed is brought into the opening of the scanner gantry the object is irradiated with the corn beam X ray whose corn angle has been adjusted by the opening width of the collimator . Then the X ray image of the object which is irradiated with the corn beam X ray is projected on the X ray detector and the X ray detector detects the X rays that passed through the object .

The console shown in is provided with a system controller for controlling the overall system of the X ray CT apparatus according to the present invention and this system controller is connected to the scanner gantry and the bed . Specifically this system controller controls the X ray controller the collimator controller the data collector the rotation controller within the scanner gantry and the bed controller within the bed .

Data collected by the data collector is inputted into the image reconstruction device according to the control by the system controller . At the time of scanogram imaging the image reconstruction device uses scanogram projection data object perspective data collected by the data collector to generate a scanogram image and at the time of scanning the projection data of multiple views being collected by the data collector is used to perform CT image reconstruction.

The scanogram image generated by the image reconstruction device the CT image being reconstructed various data and programs and the like to implement functions of the X ray CT apparatus are stored in a storage device connected to the system controller . The storage device further stores a standard imaging condition. The standard imaging condition indicates an imaging condition that is recommended depending on a physical frame and a part to be imaged of the object . The storage device further stores data and the like necessary for calculation in the scan planning device which will be described below. The system controller is connected each of the display device and the operating device and the display device displays the reconstructed image outputted from the image reconstruction device and various information handled by the system controller .

An operator manipulates the operating device which is provided with an input means for inputting various directives and information and the like into the system controller . The operator manipulates the X ray CT apparatus according to the present invention interactively by using the display device and the operating device .

Furthermore the system controller is connected to the scan planning device being a critical portion of the present invention and the scan planning device decides the imaging condition in advance before the start of scanning by using the directive inputted by the operator via the operating device and the scanogram image read out from the storage device . Specifically the scanogram image read out from the storage device is displayed on the display device and the operator designates on the scanogram image of the object being displayed the coordinate of a position for reconstructing the CT image hereinafter referred to as slice position by using the operating device thereby enabling the setting of the slice position. Information of the slice position being set here is stored in the storage device and also used to set the X ray dose control condition and the like.

The X ray CT apparatus according to the present invention performs various preparatory operations for deciding the imaging condition before doing a scan for obtaining the CT image of the object. These preparatory operations include imaging of a scanogram image for setting an imaging position of the object an analysis of the scanogram data obtained by the imaging and decision of an optimum irradiated X ray condition as the imaging condition based on the analysis. These preparatory operations are carried out under the control of the system controller .

Main components involved in the preparatory operations include the system controller scan planning device operating device display device X ray tube and X ray detector and the like as shown in . In particular the analysis of the scanogram data and the decision of the optimum irradiated X ray condition as the imaging condition based on the analysis are significant functions of the scan planning device which is connected to the system controller imaging condition decision means .

In these preparatory operations firstly in order to obtain the scanogram image perspective image obtained from one direction for planning the scanning range there are entered via the operating device the X ray condition mainly such as setting values of the X ray tube voltage a voltage applied between the anode and cathode of the X ray tube and the X ray tube current a current flowing between the anode and cathode of the X ray tube . Then the top panel placing the object thereon and the rotor plate are relatively moved along the body axis of the object without rotating the rotor plate and imaging of the scanogram image is performed. Then the scanogram projection data and the scanogram image data are stored in the storage device . A part of the functions of the image reconstruction device is used to subject the scanogram projection data to a two dimensional filtering process in the channel direction and in the view direction whereby the scanogram image data is generated.

The scan planning device analyzes the scanogram projection data for modeling an estimated cross section at an arbitrary position along the body axis of the object in a form of an elliptic cross section having an X ray absorption coefficient equivalent to water for instance. This model becomes a three dimensional type model hereinafter described as object three dimensional model in which the long axis length and short axis length of the elliptic cross section vary depending on the position along the body axis of the object hereinafter described as z position . The storage device stores the data of this object three dimensional model.

The scan planning device calculates a recommended tube voltage and a series of tube current value i.e. variation pattern of the tube current which changes over time in accordance with the variation of the object sectional shape during scanning at the recommended tube voltage based on the diagnostic object size input by the operating device set values of the tube voltage and tube current the X ray collimation condition the time per one rotation of the scanner hereinafter described as scan time and the data of the object three dimensional model generated by the scan planning device . The scan planning device having the above functions is a significant constitutional element of the present invention and with those functions an optimum X ray condition during scanning is decided X ray condition calculating means .

A scanogram of the object is imaged. A procedure to image the scanogram of the object is basically the same as the procedure to take a CT image by scanning. The object is irradiated with X rays from a fixed direction for instance from the backside of the object without rotating the rotor plate of the scanner gantry . Then the X rays passed through the object are detected by the X ray detector and the detection data is captured whereby the scanogram projection data is obtained.

The data collector collects the detection data detected by the X ray detector to obtain the scanogram projection data and the scanogram projection data is transmitted to the image reconstruction device from the data collector via the system controller . Then the image reconstruction device generates the scanogram image and displays it on the display device . The scanogram image obtained at this stage is an image viewed from the front side of an image which is generated by the X rays that passed through along the fixed direction e.g. from the back side to the front side. This scanogram image is utilized for setting a slice position CT image reconstruction position of the object upon scanning. The scanogram projection data is not only used for generating the scanogram image but also utilized for deciding an optimum X ray irradiated imaging condition upon scanning which is a particular feature of the present invention.

The operator refers to the scanogram image displayed on the display device and inputs as the imaging condition a top panel moving pitch a scanning start position zs and scanning end position ze. Here since assumption of zs ze will not cause any loss of generality it is assumed as zs ze in the following. By using these input data items the scan planning device decides a range for capturing a CT image of the object a slice position z a phase angle of the X ray tube a phase angle of the rotor plate . Here the scanning start position zs and the scanning end position ze respectively indicate the z position of an initial CT image and the z position of a final CT image among the images obtained by a series of scanning.

The operator inputs the imaging condition from the operating device such as a standard tube voltage a standard tube current a scan time X ray collimation condition a type of reconstruction filter function an FOV size a slice thickness and a window condition.

The operator inputs from the operating device the start position zss and the end position zse of the imaging range particularly focused and the size d o of the diagnostic object for example contrast enhanced liver cell cancer . It is to be noted here that zs zss zse ze. When the input of zss is skipped zss zs is set automatically and when the input of zse is skipped zse ze is set automatically. In addition as the size d o of the diagnostic object a diameter of the circle having an area equivalent to the diagnostic object equivalent diameter is inputted for instance.

The scan planning device analyzes the scanogram projection data and generates the three dimensional model of the object . This three dimensional model of the object is an approximation of each cross section of the object in association with the z position in a form of an elliptic cross section having the X ray absorption coefficient equivalent to water. Since the patent document 1 and the Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001 276040 disclose this approximation method the explanation thereof will not be made here.

When the standard tube voltage xv ref and standard current time product a product of the tube current value and the scan time i ref are used a predictive value SD ref z xv ref i ref of an image SD value of the CT image is calculated the CT image being obtained at an arbitrary slice position z within the range from the scan start position zs to the scan end position ze first image SD predictive value calculating means . Also for this predictive calculation method the method disclosed in the patent document 1 and the Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001 276040 can be applied to the sectional model the standard tube voltage xv ref and the standard current time product i ref at each slice position z. Therefore the explanation of the predictive value calculation method will not be made here.

The maximum value MAX SD ref of the SD ref z xv ref i ref that is predicted in step S within the specific slice positional range zss z zse and the slice position z MAXSD reference slice position where the image SD value becomes MAX SD ref are obtained slice position calculating means for calculating a slice position where the image SD predicted value is the maximum .

A CNR is obtained which enables identification of the diagnostic object from the diagnostic object size d o inputted in step S contrast to noise ratio calculating means . As shown in a function CNR det func of the relationship between the diagnostic object size d and the CNR enabling identification is obtained in advance by experiment and a targeted contrast to noise ratio enabling identification CNR det is obtained according to the following formula Formula 1 

Representation by formula 2 is also possible using a polynomial. For this case it is expressed as Formula 2 

In addition the relationship between the diagnostic object size d o and the CNR enabling identification may be held in the storage device as a data table as shown in . This data table may be disclosed to the operator allowing the operator to make desired modifications to the data table. For this case it is desirable that an optimum approximate curve is generated automatically based on the modified data by subjecting the discrete data to the spline interpolation or the like.

Here the CNR enabling identification calculated in step S is corrected based on the information of the slice thickness and the window condition set in step S. Specifically the correcting process is performed according to the procedure as shown in .

A diagnostic object effective diameter d eff is calculated from the slice thickness and the diagnostic object size d.

When the diagnostic object is assumed as a sphere the slice becomes thicker the apparent size of the sphere becomes smaller. Therefore an effective size of the diagnostic object is obtained here. Typically it is expressed according to the following formula. When the slice thickness is assumed as Sthick the formula is 

An influence on the CNR enabling identification is corrected based on the effective diameter d eff of the diagnostic object. Here the variation of the effective diameter caused by the slice thickness influences the CNR enabling identification.

As shown in in the graph indicating the relationship between the CNR enabling identification and the diagnostic object size diameter when the diagnostic object size is changed from d o to d eff the CNR enabling identification is also changed and the CNR enabling identification after the correction at this point of time becomes CNR d modu.

An influence exerted on the contrast of the diagnostic object by the slice thickness and the window condition window width and window level is corrected. When the slice thickness and the window condition are changed an apparent contrast of the diagnostic object is changed. Accordingly it is necessary to correct the CNR enabling identification appropriately.

As discussed above according to the procedures from S to S it is possible to obtain the corrected CNR enabling identification CNR d modu considering the slice thickness and the window condition. The correction of the CNR enabling identification according to step S to step S is not indispensable in the present embodiment. However the correction considering the slice thickness and the window condition allows the X ray condition to be set at a higher degree of precision. Hereinafter the contrast to noise ratio enabling identification CNR det which is to be referred to includes the contrast to noise ratio enabling identification after the correction was made as described above.

SD xv ref being a reference value of the image SD value to be achieved at the standard tube voltage is obtained according to the following formula based on the assumed contrast value C o at the standard tube voltage xv ref of the diagnostic object the contrast value being stored in advance in the storage device and CNR det being obtained in step S first image SD reference value calculating means Formula 3 11 Calculate Current Time Product i ta z MAXSD to Achieve the SD xv ref Step S 

The tube current time product i ta z MAXSD is obtained according to the following formula for achieving the SD xv ref being the image SD value at the standard tube voltage xv ref and at the reference slice position z MAXSD first tube current time product calculating means Formula 4 12 Calculate Tube Voltage xv a Satisfying the Image SD the Upper Limit SD ULIM and Image SD Value SD xv a Predicted at the Slice Position Z MAXSD Step S 

Considering the image quality of the portion other than the identification target the tube voltage xv a is obtained which allows the image SD when the tube current time product is i ta z MAXSD calculated in the formula 4 to become equal to or less than the upper limit value SD ULIM. As for the upper limit value SD ULIM of the image SD an appropriate value is inputted from the operating device in advance or alternatively a recommended value may be set as a default in the storage device . Here it is known that the CNR of the contrast enhanced target is kept approximately constant irrespective of the tube voltage under the condition that the tube current is kept unchanged. Therefore variation of the tube voltage may not adversely affect the diagnosis of the contrast enhanced target. Accordingly in calculating the tube voltage xv a the predictive function of the image SD value is employed and the lowest tube voltage xv a satisfying the following formula is obtained by using the relationship between the tube voltage and the image SD under the condition that the slice position is z MAXSD and the tube current time product is i ta z MAXSD as shown in the relationship being obtained based on experimental data and the like first tube voltage calculating means Formula 5 

On this occasion the image SD value predicted at the slice position z MAXSD is assumed as SD xv a. It is to be noted that the relationship between the tube voltage and the image SD is typically expressed as shown in the following formula Formula 6 

 13 Calculate Image SD Predictive Value when the Tube Voltage is xv a and the Tube Current Time Product is i ta z MAXSD Step S 

According to the image SD predictive function the image SD value SD ref z xv a i ta z MAXSD of the CT image is predicted which is obtained when the tube voltage xv a and the tube current time product i ta z MAXSD are used at each slice position z second image SD predictive value calculating means .

 14 Calculate Current Time Product i r z for Achieving the Image SD Value SD xv a at the Slice Position z Step S 

The tube current time product i r z for achieving the image SD value SD xv a is obtained according to the following formula the image SD value being predicted at the slice position z MAXSD under the condition that the tube voltage is xv a at each slice position z second tube current time product calculating means 

The tube current time product i r z and the tube voltage xv a being obtained according to the above procedure are assumed as a recommended condition of the tube current time product and the tube voltage being calculated in the scan planning device .

 15 Display the Relationship of Tube Voltage and Tube Current to Exposure Dose and Image SD Predictive Value Step S 

Expected values are calculated such as the exposure dose CTDI Computed Tomography Dose Index the image SD value the identifiable size of the diagnostic target in the case where the imaging is performed under the aforementioned recommended condition and other conditions and these values are displayed as options for the operator. By way of example as to each of the following options to as shown in expected values such as the tube voltage the average tube current a value obtained by dividing the tube current time product by the scan time the exposure dose CTDI the image SD value the identifiable size of the diagnostic object and the like are displayed expected values of evaluation index displaying means . Here it is clearly demonstrated that the option is the recommended condition among those options. It is to be noted that the identifiable size of the diagnostic object can be calculated by using the inverse function of the function CNR det func described in the formula 1.

 Standard tube voltage xv ref and current time product i r z are used only the tube current is optimized 

In the aforementioned options and indicates the case where both the tube voltage and the tube current are optimized indicates the case where only the tube current is optimized and a standard value is used for the tube voltage and indicates the case where the standard imaging condition is used without optimizing any of the tube voltage and the tube current.

Displaying values as described above makes each of the cases clearly understandable in regard to advantages and disadvantages and the operator is allowed to choose the imaging condition taking these advantages and disadvantages into account. Generally when an X ray condition is acquired for achieving a CNR appropriate for identifying the diagnostic object which is the object of the present invention and scanning is performed under the X ray condition the case is the best. However the options other than may be selected according to decision of a radiologist or the like. Even in such a case if predicted values are displayed regarding a resultant image quality and the like it is helpful for making a decision.

The selection of the condition is performed as the following for instance the conditions shown in are displayed on the display device and a condition to be used is selected out of the conditions being displayed via an input unit of the operating device for example by a mouse clicking X ray condition selection means .

As discussed above it is possible to decide the imaging condition that is able to achieve an appropriate CNR for identifying the diagnostic object. It is to be noted here that in order to make the diagnostic object to be identifiable with the minimum exposure dose the option is the most suitable. However if it is desired to obtain an image having an image SD value smaller than the option even though there is some increase of exposure dose the option is selected. On the other hand if it is considered most appropriate to do scanning under the standard condition to which the operator is empirically accustomed the option is selected. However there is a possibility that the option cannot achieve an appropriate CNR and if the identifiable size being displayed becomes larger than the inputted diagnostic object size the option or the option may be selected again.

As thus described when the imaging condition is decided actually it may be decided based on the experience and the like of the radiologist. Therefore considering such situation it is configured such that the imaging condition can be selected in accordance with the usage purpose as described above and therefore a flexible system can be established.

The imaging condition decided according to the procedure above is stored in the storage device . While doing a scan the system controller reads out the imaging condition sequentially for each imaging part of the object and controls the imaging condition the tube voltage and the tube current during scanning via the X ray controller .

The devices such as the system controller the scan planning device and the operating device for executing the aforementioned functions and processing can be implemented by a configuration that is operated according to computer programs. The configuration is established by combining elements such as a processor a computer a memory a storage device a register a timing control an interrupt a communication interface and an I O signal interface.

The present invention has been explained referring to one embodiment. However it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and the disclosed embodiment is susceptible of changes and modifications without departing from the scope of the invention.

As discussed above the X ray CT apparatus of the present invention is provided with the scan planning device which allow a scanogram analysis and an object three dimensional model generation function in which the three dimensional model of the object is generated from the scanogram projection data of the object and an optimum imaging condition setting function which calculates a CNR necessary for diagnosis according to the identification target size and calculates and sets the imaging condition appropriate for the imaging part of the object based on the three dimensional model of the object . Therefore it is possible to easily provide an X ray CT examination that enables an acquisition of an object image with an appropriate image quality.

Next five other preferred embodiments will be explained with reference to the drawings from . In order to distinguish the five other preferred embodiments from the embodiment having been explained with the operational flow shown in the example shown in is assumed as the first embodiment and the five other embodiments are assumed as the second embodiment the third embodiment the fourth embodiment the fifth embodiment and the sixth embodiment in the order explained below.

A scanogram of the object is imaged. Since imaging of the scanogram is the same as the first embodiment the details thereof will not be tediously explained.

This process is the same as the steps S S S and S of the first embodiment and an operator refers to the scanogram image and sets via the operating device an imaging region scanning start position zs and scanning end position ze including the diagnostic object. Here as the imaging condition of the slice position a slice thickness a top panel moving pitch a scan time a standard tube voltage a standard tube current an X ray collimation condition types of reconstruction filter function an FOV size a window condition and the like are inputted.

Similar to S and S of the first embodiment the scan planning device analyzes the scanogram projection data and generates the object three dimensional model of the object .

The size of a thing assumed as the diagnostic object e.g. contrast enhanced liver cell cancer is inputted and set via the input unit of the operating device . In addition the operator inputs and sets the true positive fraction and the false positive fraction serving as a guide for a diagnosis via the input unit of the operating device the true positive fraction being described as TPF indicating a probability that a disease existing in the diagnostic object is properly identified and a false positive fraction being described as FPF indicating a probability that a disease is determined to exist in the diagnostic object even though such disease does not actually exist therein TPF and FPF setting means . The size of the diagnostic object is assumed as a diameter r of a circle circle equivalent diameter having an area equivalent to the diagnostic object.

According to the diagnostic object size d o inputted by the operator in step S CNR det which can identify the diagnostic object is obtained contrast to noise ratio calculating means . The CNR enabling identification CNR det is calculated by using a relational chart between the diagnostic object size d o and the CNR enabling identification as shown in a relationship between the diagnostic object size and the contrast to noise ratio enabling identification a relational chart between the FPF and TPF as shown in a relationship between the true positive fraction and the false positive fraction and a relational chart between CNR enabling identification and FPF as shown in a relationship between the contrast to noise ratio enabling identification and the false positive fraction .

At first in order to obtain the relationship between the diagnostic object size d o and the CNR enabling identification as shown in it is necessary for the operator to input TPF FPF d o and the like for instance to obtain the relationship between FPF and TPF as shown in and the relationship between the CNR enabling identification and FPF as shown in as described below.

An ROC curve receiver operating characteristic curve representing the relationship between the FPF and TPF as shown in is calculated by conducting an ROC analysis by using an image with an already known CNR for the case where the CNR is made to be variable with respect to each diagnostic target size and then the result of the calculation is stored in the storage device . When the TPF value inputted by the operator in step S is T on the ROC curve of the scan planning device calculates FPF F corresponding to TPF T according to the ROC curve when d o r and CNR a for instance. Similarly according to the ROC curve for each different CNR FPF corresponding to TPF T is obtained and the CNR FPF curve as shown in is generated. Thereafter on the CNR FPF curve CNR det when FPF F for instance is calculated as the CNR enabling identification for the diagnostic object size r see .

The CNR FPF curve is generated as to various diagnostic object sizes at the time when the operator inputs TPF and it is stored in the storage device . Here by further defining an FPF value a relational chart between the diagnostic object size d o and the CNR enabling identification is generated as shown in . On the basis of the relational chart as shown in the operator inputs the diagnostic object size d o associated with the pertinent examination whereby a CNR det enabling identification associated with the diagnostic object size d o can be calculated.

It is to be noted that the ROC curve for each CNR stored in the storage device can be modified according to the radiologist. When the curve is modified according to the radiologist a data set for conducting the ROC analysis may be stored in the storage device or a data set prepared by the operator may be used.

In step S it is alternatively possible to skip inputting TPF and FPF and default values such as TPF 0.95 and FPF 0.05 are stored in the storage device in advance. Furthermore inputting of the diagnostic object size d o may be skipped. In this case according to a diagnostic object part or an imaging part a value is set in advance in the storage device d o 10 mm for a region of liver for instance and this value may be modified by the radiologist. It is to be noted that the relationship between the diagnostic object size d o and the CNR enabling identification is typically the same as the aforementioned formula 2.

Here if the radiologist is predesignated the data set stored in the storage device is called before step S and by using the ROC analysis result obtained by the radiologist and the formula 2 a CNR enabling identification is obtained which is derived from the diagnostic object size set by the radiologist. Consequently the curve of the calculated formula 2 perfectly coincides with the interpretation ability of the radiologist whereby it is possible to set a more suitable CNR enabling identification. Setting of the CNR enabling identification according to this method is also applicable to the following embodiments the third embodiment the fourth embodiment and the fifth embodiment in the similar manner. Furthermore the CNR enabling identification calculated in step S as described above may be corrected considering the slice thickness and the window condition inputted in step S in the similar manner as the steps S to S of the first embodiment.

 6 Calculate Slice Position z MAXSD that Maximizes the Image SD Under the Identical Imaging Condition in the 3D Model Being Generated Step S 

A reference slice position z MAXSD is calculated which maximizes the image SD under the identical condition within the scan range from the three dimensional model of the object generated in step S slice position calculating means . This z MAXSD is calculated by analyzing the projection height of the scanogram the projection height is associated with X ray attenuation for each slice the larger is the projection height the larger is the X ray attenuation and accordingly the image SD becomes larger .

 7 Calculate Image SD z MAXSD at the Reference Slice Position z MAXSD from the Assumed Contrast Value and CNR det Step S 

In this step according to the assumed contrast value C d considering the imaging part the object size and the like and the CNR det calculated in step S SD z MAXSD being the image SD at the reference slice position z MAXSD is calculated by the following formula 7 image SD value calculating means 2 Formula 7 

Assuming a contrast of the liver area for instance the assumed contrast value C d indicates an absolute value of a CT value difference between the liver cell cancer as a diagnostic object and the liver substance. Here the assumed contrast value of the liver becomes larger in proportion to the density of contrast agent administered to a patient. Furthermore the larger is the object size the smaller the assumed contrast value is.

Here HU init represents a contrast agent density that is used to calculate a normalized contrast effect and HU dia represents a contrast agent density that is actually used in clinical status. This HU ref is used as the assumed contrast effect C d in the formula 7.

The aforementioned assumed contrast value is stored in advance in the storage device in association with a diagnostic object portion an imaging part an object physical frame and the like.

 8 Calculate mAs z MAXSD Satisfying SD z MAXSD at the Reference Slice Position z MAXSD when the Object Size is L Step S 

According to the relationship between the image SD when the object size is L and the tube current time product mAs as shown in the tube current time product mAs z MAXSD associated with the image SD SD z MAXSD is calculated current time product calculating means . Here the tube voltage condition of the curve of the image SD current time product mAs is assumed as 120 kV for instance hereinafter referred to as standard tube voltage xv ref .

The relational chart between the image SD and the tube current time product mAs as shown in is used among those stored in the storage device in advance as to each object size. As the data necessary for generating the relational chart the data obtained by imaging water phantoms of various sizes by the X ray CT apparatus to be employed or data generated based on simulation data may be used.

 9 Calculate mAs Correction Coefficient and Correct mAs for Keeping the CNR Approximately Constant Irrespective of the Tube Voltage on the Basis of the Relationship Between the Tube Voltage and Normalized CNR when the Object Size is L Under the Condition of mAs z MAXSD step S 

Under the condition of the tube current time product mAs z MAXSD calculated in step S on the basis of the relational chart between the tube voltage and the normalized CNR when the object size is L as shown in mAs correction coefficient is calculated for keeping the CNR approximately constant irrespective of the tube voltage tube current time product correction coefficient calculating means . This is to consider that the CNR is apt to be reduced as the tube voltage becomes smaller as indicated by the solid line graph of . For instance when the tube voltage is b 

It is desirable that the data used for generating the relational chart between the tube voltage and the normalized CNR is obtained by imaging water phantoms having various sizes in the X ray CT apparatus to be employed. However data generated on the basis of simulation data may be used.

 10 Calculate Optimum Tube Voltage Exposure Dose and X Ray Tube Power Under the Condition of Corrected mAs Step S 

Basic data of the exposure dose and the X ray tube power calculated from various conditions in the X ray CT apparatus to be used or simulation is stored in the storage device in advance. Then exposure dose e.g. CTDIw and X ray tube power at the slice position of z MAXSD are calculated using the corrected tube current time product mAs corr for each tube voltage calculated in step S. The relationship among the tube voltage exposure dose and X ray tube power on this occasion are as shown in . An optimum value of the tube voltage kV opt is the optimum tube voltage that minimizes the exposure dose under the condition where the X ray tube power kW becomes kW kW max rated X ray tube power tube voltage calculating means .

In on the basis of the exposure dose for each phantom size and tube voltage which is calculated by the X ray CT apparatus to be employed or the simulation since the unit is mGy mAs the exposure dose is obtained once mAs is calculated the corrected tube current mAs corr calculated according to the imaging condition for each tube voltage is multiplied by the mAs value so as to generate the relationship between the tube voltage and the exposure dose. Further the X ray tube power can be calculated for each tube voltage according to the calculation tube voltage tube current. By utilizing the values above the relationship between the tube voltage and the X ray tube power can be generated.

The X ray tube power is calculated because it is necessary to check whether the X ray condition being calculated is within the usage range of the X ray CT apparatus and to know how long will be a waiting time until an image is taken under this imaging condition. The exposure dose e.g. CTDIw is measured pursuant to a global standard of the measurement method CTDIw recommended by the IEC. It is obtained by converting an average of mAs values that fluctuate within the scan range into CTDIw as energy absorbed by radiation per unit mass .

 11 Calculate mAs Value Satisfying CNR det on Other Slice Plane z and Display Imaging Information such as Image SD a Recommended Tube Voltage and Exposure Dose Step S 

Under the condition of optimum tube voltage kV opt obtained in step S mAs z being mAs value satisfying CNR det on other slice plane z is calculated according to the formula 9 from the tube voltage normalized CNR curve as shown in for each size of photographic object size L z and the exposure dose e.g. CTDIw and the X ray tube power under the condition of xv opt and mAs z are calculated.

Then the display device displays the imaging information being obtained according to the steps above such as the assumed contrast value of the diagnostic object the contrast to noise ratio the image SD the identifiable size d o of the diagnostic object the exposure dose CTDIw the optimum tube voltage the average tube current a value obtained by dividing the mAs value by the scan time and the X ray tube power kW . One example of these displayed elements is shown in . Also in this example the recommended imaging condition that is optimized by the steps above and the imaging condition without any optimization are displayed for the operator.

As thus described the recommended imaging condition being optimized and the condition following a conventional imaging condition without optimization are displayed side by side. Therefore it is possible to clearly present a different point of the recommended X ray condition optimized by the present embodiment.

According to the procedure above it is possible to decide an imaging condition that is capable of achieving a CNR appropriate for identifying the diagnostic object. The imaging condition decided as described is stored in the storage device . Then while the system controller calls the condition sequentially in association with an imaging part of the object upon scanning the X ray controller carries out scanning by using the tube current obtained by dividing the mAs value by the scan time according to the mAs value calculated in association with each slice position.

 1 Since the steps of imaging scanogram S setting of scan area inputting of imaging condition S analysis of scanogram data S up to the generation of three dimensional model of the object S are the same as the processing from step S to step S of the second embodiment explanations of each step will not be made tediously.

 2 Calculate slice position z MAXSD that maximizes the image SD under an identical imaging condition in 3D model step S 

A slice position z MAXSD is calculated which maximizes the image SD under the identical imaging condition within the scan range from the three dimensional model of the object that is generated in step S slice position calculating means . This z MAXSD is calculated by analyzing the projection height of the scanogram the projection height is associated with X ray attenuation for each slice the larger is the projection height the larger is X ray attenuation and accordingly the image SD becomes larger . This is the same as the second embodiment.

SD dem target image SD being an image SD demanded by the operator is inputted and set via the input means of the operating device target image SD setting means . When a real scan is carried out the X ray dose is controlled by the X ray controller in such a manner that SD dem is achieved at all the slice positions based on the SD dem being inputted.

In this step a CNR enabling identification is calculated from the assumed contrast value considering the imaging part the object size and the like and the SD dem inputted in step S and a size d of the object identifiable in the diagnosis is inversely calculated according to the concept of formula 2 which represents the relationship between the CNR enabling identification and the diagnostic object size diagnostic object size calculating means . Then the size is displayed on the display device . The assumed contrast value is the same as the one explained in step S of the second embodiment and it is stored in the storage device in advance in association with a diagnostic object portion an imaging part an object physical frame and the like.

The size d of the object to be displayed can be calculated at the slice position z MAXSD as a reference which maximizes the image SD under the identical imaging condition for instance. When the assumed contrast value at z MAXSD is assumed as C z MAXSD according to the definition of CNR and the formula 2 the following formula 10 is established assumed contrast value calculating means 

In the case above since the relationship between the diagnostic object size and the image SD is clarified it is possible to set the SD dem more easily. Values stored in advance in the storage device for each imaging part or each diagnostic object may be used as defaults of the assumed contrast value and the SD dem. Alternatively the operator himself or herself may input the values via the input unit of the operating device . The assumed contrast value inputted is reflected on the formula 10.

In this step the operator determines whether or not the identifiable size d diameter r of a circle having an area equal to the diagnostic object displayed in step S is appropriate for a portion of diagnosis or a degree of disease diagnostic object size determination means . If it is determined as appropriate the next step is S whereas if it is determined as not appropriate the process goes again to steps S and S while the operator adjusts the image SD image SD value adjusting means . The procedure from the step S is the same as the second embodiment except that the SD used as a standard is SD dem which is the target SD value.

In this step mAs SD dem is calculated which is a tube current time product satisfying the SD dem on the image SD tube current time product mAs curve as shown in when the object size is L at the slice position z MAXSD tube current time product calculating means . The tube voltage condition in this case is the standard tube voltage xv ref.

 7 Calculate mAs Correction Coefficient and Correct mAs for Keeping the CNR Constant Irrespective of Tube Voltage on the Basis of the Relationship Between the Tube Voltage and CNR when the Object Size is L Under the Condition of mAs SD dem Step S 

According to the tube voltage normalized CNR curve as shown in under the condition that the object size L and mAs SD dem an mAs correction coefficient is calculated for keeping the CNR constant irrespective of the tube voltage tube current time product correction coefficient calculating means . More particularly under the condition of mAs SD dem calculated in step S on the basis of the tube voltage normalized CNR curve when the object size is L mAs correction coefficient is calculated by the formula 9 for keeping the CNR approximately constant irrespective of the tube voltage.

Then the mAs SD dem is corrected by the mAs correction coefficient and a corrected mAs is obtained tube current time product correction means 

 8 Calculate Optimum Tube Voltage Exposure Dose and X Ray Tube Power Under the Condition of the Corrected mAs Step S 

The exposure dose e.g. CTDIw and X ray tube power at the slice position of z MAXSD are calculated using the corrected mAs calculated for each tube voltage in step S. The calculation method is the same as step S of the second embodiment. The optimum value kV opt of the tube voltage is to minimize the exposure dose under the condition where the X ray tube power kW kW max tube voltage calculating means .

 9 Calculate mAs Value Satisfying the SD dem on Other Slice Plane z and Display Image SD Recommended Tube Voltage Exposure Dose and the Like Step S 

Under the condition of the optimum tube voltage kV opt obtained in step S mAs z being the mAs value satisfying the SD dem at other slice plane z is calculated by the formula 9 from the tube voltage normalized CNR curve for each object size L z as shown in and the exposure dose e.g. CTDIw and X ray tube power under the condition of kV opt and mAs z are calculated.

The imaging condition information obtained according to the procedure above such as the assumed contrast value of the diagnostic object the contrast to noise ratio the image SD the identifiable size d of the diagnostic object the exposure dose CTDIw and the X ray tube power kW is displayed on the display device . Also in this displaying process similar to the display example of the second embodiment the recommended imaging condition being optimized by the present embodiment and the condition following a conventional imaging condition without optimization are shown side by side for the operator. Therefore it is possible to clearly present a different point of the recommended X ray condition optimized by the present embodiment.

As thus described according to the third embodiment it is possible to decide an imaging condition that allows an acquisition of a CNR appropriate for identifying the diagnostic object. Furthermore some operators who are accustomed to a system for inputting an image SD such as automatic exposure mechanism conventionally used are allowed to decide easily an imaging condition with little inhibitions in applying the present embodiment. The thus decided imaging condition is stored in the storage device . Then while the system controller calls the condition sequentially in association with an imaging part of the object upon scanning the X ray controller carries out scanning by using the tube current obtained by dividing the mAs value by the scan time according to the mAs value calculated in association with each slice position.

 1 Since the steps of imaging scanogram S setting of scan area inputting of imaging condition S analysis of scanogram data S up to the generation of three dimensional model of the object S are the same as the processing from step S to step S of the second embodiment and as the processing from step S to step S of the third embodiment explanations of each step will not be made tediously. 2 Designate Slice Position z def Step S and Input FPF and Diagnostic Object Size d o Step S 

In these steps an operator designates a desired slice position z def desired slice position designating means and inputs and sets the FPF and the diagnostic object size d o false positive fraction setting means and diagnostic object size setting means . The slice position may be designated by specifying a slice section or a volume.

 3 Calculate CNR d which Enables Identification of the Diagnostic Object from the Assumed Contrast Value and the Image SD z def at the Desired Slice Position z def Step S 

With the assumed contrast value considering the imaging part the object size and the like and the desired slice position z def designated in step S an image SD value SD z def at the desired slice position z def are obtained from the object 3D model calculated in step S by using the image SD predictive function desired slice position image SD predicting means .

The data obtained by imaging water phantoms of various sizes in the X ray CT apparatus to be employed and analyzing the image SD or data generated based on simulation data is used for predicting SD z def . These data items are stored in the storage device . A three dimensional model of the object is established at the slice position z def and is compared to the data stored in the storage device so that the image SD is predicted.

Using the image SD z def predicted according to the above procedure the contrast to noise ratio enabling identification CNR d within the diagnostic object area at the slice position z def can be calculated according to the following formula 11 third contrast to noise ratio calculating means assumed contrast value Formula 11 4 Determine Whether or Not the Image SD z def at the Desired Slice Position z def is within the Marginal Performance Range of the Device Step S 

In this step it is determined whether or not the image SD z def in the three dimensional model of the object calculated in step S is feasible in the X ray CT apparatus being employed image SD predictive value feasibility determination means .

For the determination the relationship between the image SD and the tube current time product mAs as shown in is used under the condition of the three dimensional model of the object being calculated. Software refers to a configuration file of the X ray CT apparatus regarding the mAs that satisfies SD z def thereby determining whether or not the mAs is within the marginal performance range of the X ray CT apparatus. It is to be noted that the configuration file is a parameter setting file in which a combination of various imaging conditions operational conditions as CT system and the like are described.

In making the determination above if it is determined as feasible in the X ray CT apparatus the next step is S whereas if it is determined as unfeasible the procedures from step S to S are repeated while the operator changes the parameters false positive fraction and diagnostic object size adjusting means .

It is further determined whether or not the CNR d calculated in step S is applicable to all over the scan area set in step S contrast to noise ratio determination means . If it is applicable to all the slice positions the next step is S whereas if it is not applicable the next step is S.

 6 Calculate mAs Correction Coefficient Calculate Optimum Tube Voltage kV opt and Corrected mAs and Display the Imaging Condition Step S 

This step is the same as steps S to S in the second embodiment. It is to be noted however that the descriptions z MAXSD and SD z MAXSD in the second embodiment are replaced by z def and SD z def respectively tube current time product calculating means tube current time product correction coefficient calculating means tube current time product correction means and tube voltage calculating means .

Here as to some of the object sizes diameter r in association with the slice positions the mAs value may exceed the marginal performance range of the X ray CT apparatus in order to achieve the CNR d. In this case modification is made to achieve a CNR which is close to the CNR d as possible and scanning is performed using a limit value within the performance range which is acceptable to the device. In the case above as shown in with the mark of o it is possible to clearly demonstrate the operator the slice position that is not able to achieve the CNR d by a highlighting on the display device . It is further possible not to demand the marginal performance of the device in the area other than the focused slice position designated by the operator as indicating Apply device marginal output in .

In the present embodiment radio buttons are provided to indicate locations corresponding to the slice positions respectively so as to establish a configuration to place a checkmark for the slice position where imaging with critical power output is performed. Instead there is another implementing method such as clicking the slice position by a mouse and the method for implementation is not limited to the example as described above.

By employing the method described above the operator is allowed to check in advance a position where the CNR d is not guaranteed on the image being displayed. In addition by setting that the marginal performance of the device is not demanded depending on the slice position unnecessary exposure is suppressed enabling a further reduction of exposure dose.

If it is determined in step S that the CNR d calculated in step S is not applicable to the whole scan area this step further determines whether or not the SD z def is satisfactory at all the slice positions according to the examination details and the diagnostic area all slice positions applicability determination means .

If it is determined that the SD z ref is satisfactory at all the slice positions in step S all slice positions applicability determination means the next step is S. If it is determined that the SD z ref is not applicable to all the slice positions the next step is S.

The imaging condition is controlled so that the image SD def is satisfied irrespective of the slice position and with reference to mAs z that achieves the SD def is calculated by using the image SD predictive function for each object size L z the second tube current time product calculating means . Since is a curve of the image SD tube current time product mAs of the object size L at z MAXSD mAs z can be calculated from the curve for each object size L z in association with the slice position z. Since the method keeps the image SD equivalent to that of the designated slice position it is effective in generating an image by MPR multi planar reconstruction or the like.

 9 Calculate Exposure Dose and X Ray Tube Power Under the Condition of mAs z that Satisfies SD def for Each Slice Position at the Optimum Tube Voltage xv opt Step S 

In this step the diagnostic object size L z of the object and the object size L z def at the slice position z def being designated are compared object size comparing means and the following process is performed.

Firstly for the case of L z L z def the processing similar to step S is performed the third tube current time product calculating means tube current time product correction coefficient calculating means tube current time product correction means and tube voltage calculating means .

For the case of L z L z def by using the optimum tube voltage kV opt calculated in the case where L z L z def the exposure dose e.g. CTDIw and the X ray tube power under the condition of mAs z are calculated for each slice position z. As for the mAs z in the case where L z L z def an mAs value satisfying the SD def is calculated from the image SD tube current time product mAs curve as shown in at the optimum tube voltage xv opt. Then a coefficient for correcting the calculated mAs value is obtained in the same manner as the case where L z L z def and then the mAs value is corrected. The optimum value of the tube voltage on this occasion is an optimum tube voltage that minimizes the exposure dose under the condition that the X ray tube power kW satisfies kW kW ref a reference value of the X ray tube power tube power calculating means .

There may be a slice position where the mAs value satisfying the image SD def goes over the marginal performance of the X ray CT apparatus depending on the diagnostic object size L z of the object. In this case the imaging parameter is adjusted so as to approach the SD def as close as possible and scanning is performed with the marginal performance of the X ray CT apparatus. Then for the operator it is also possible to clearly demonstrate the slice position which is not able to achieve the SD def by highlighting on the display device as shown in . It is further possible not to demand the marginal performance of the device in the area other than the focused slice position designated by the operator.

Also in the present embodiment radio buttons are provided to indicate locations corresponding to the slice positions respectively so as to establish a configuration to place a checkmark for the slice position where imaging with critical power output is performed. Instead there is another implementing method such as clicking the slice position by a mouse and the method for implementation is not limited to the example as described above.

By employing the method described above the operator is allowed to check in advance a position where the SD def is not guaranteed on the image being displayed. In addition since the settings are configured so that the marginal performance of the X ray CT device is not demanded depending on the slice position unnecessary exposure is suppressed enabling a further reduction of exposure dose.

 10 Display Information such as Image SD Identifiable Size of Diagnostic Object Exposure Dose X Ray Tube Power Step S 

The information decided in step S such as the tube voltage the tube current average tube current obtained by dividing mAs by the scan time the image SD the identifiable size of the diagnostic object the exposure dose the X ray tube power and the like is displayed on the display device and then imaging is started.

 11 Calculate mAs z def Satisfying SD z def at z def by Using the Image SD Predictive Function Step S 

In step S if it is determined that the SD z def is not applied to all the slices imaging is carried out at all the slice positions with the tube current time product mAs z def which satisfies CNR d at the slice position z def. Here the mAs z def is calculated by using the image SD predictive function at the object size L z def the fourth tube current time product calculating means . Since an identical mAs can be used at all the slice positions in this method there is an advantage that drastically simplifies the tube current control.

 12 Calculate Exposure Dose and X Ray Tube Power for Each Slice Position Under the Condition of mAs z def with Respect to All the Tube Voltages Being Available Step S 

By using the tube current time product mAs z def calculated in step S the exposure dose e.g. CTDIw and X ray tube power at the slice position z def are calculated with respect to all the available tube voltages exposure dose and X ray tube power at designated slice position calculating means . On this occasion the optimum value kV opt of the tube voltage is the tube voltage that minimizes the exposure dose under the condition that X ray tube power kW satisfies kW kW max tube voltage calculating means .

 13 Display Information such as Image SD Identifiable Size of Diagnostic Object Exposure Dose X Ray Tube Power Step S 

The information decided in step S such as the tube voltage the tube current average tube current obtained by dividing mAs by the scan time the image SD the identifiable size of the diagnostic object the exposure dose the X ray tube power is displayed on the display device and then imaging is started.

In the description explained so far it is determined whether or not SD z def is satisfactory at all the slice positions according to the examination details and the diagnostic area when the operation moves to step S and to step S. However it is further possible to perform the procedure from the step S and S without going through the step S and after displaying the information such as the image SD the identifiable size of the diagnostic object the exposure dose and the X ray tube power being decided in step and step S the operator may select an imaging condition that the operator considers as the most suitable for the examination.

As thus described according to the fourth embodiment the operator designates a desired diagnostic area and thereby the imaging condition that allows an acquisition of a CNR appropriate for identifying the diagnostic object can be decided. Accordingly it is possible to reduce the exposure dose to the degree approximately the same as the third embodiment.

The imaging condition decided as thus described is stored in the storage device . Then while the system controller calls the condition sequentially in association with an imaging part of the object upon scanning the X ray controller carries out scanning by using the tube current obtained by dividing the mAs value by the scan time according to the mAs value calculated in association with each slice position.

 1 Since the steps of imaging scanogram S setting of real scan area inputting of imaging condition S analysis of scanogram data S up to the generation of three dimensional model of object S are the same as the processing from step S to step S of the second embodiment the processing from step S to step S of the third embodiment and from step S to step S of the fourth embodiment explanations of each step will not be made tediously. 2 Set Multiple Regions of Interest Step S 

Multiple regions of interest are set within the real scan area provided in step S as to which the operator desires to change the conditions respectively multiple regions of interest setting means . In the following explanations each number of the multiple regions being set is assumed as n.

An operator inputs FPF n as a guide used for a diagnosis and a size of the diagnostic object e.g. contrast enhanced liver cell cancer d o for each region being set diagnostic object size setting means and multiple false positive fraction setting means . The diagnostic object size d o is assumed as a diameter r of a circle having an area equivalent to the diagnostic object circle equivalent diameter for instance.

 4 Calculate CNR d n which can Identify the Diagnostic Object in Each Region of Interest Being Set Step 

CNR d n to be achieved is calculated on the basis of the diagnostic object size that the operator inputted in step S the fourth contrast to noise ratio calculating means . Similar to the second embodiment the relationship between the CNR enabling identification and the diagnostic object size the relational diagram between the FPF and the TPF and the relational diagram between the CNR enabling identification and the FPF as shown in and are used for calculating the CNR which is to be achieved. The CNR enabling identification is corrected based on the slice thickness and the window condition similar to the first embodiment.

 5 Calculate Slice Position z ref n that Maximizes the Image SD for Each Region of Interest being Set in the 3D Model of the Object Step S 

A slice position z ref n is calculated which maximizes the image SD under the identical imaging condition for each region of interest ROI set in step S from the object three dimensional model generated in step S slice position calculating means .

 6 Calculate Image SD z ref n at the Slice Position z ref n Based on the Assumed Contrast Value and CNR d n Step S 

In this step according to the assumed contrast value considering the imaging part the object size and the like and the CNR d n calculated in step S the image SD z ref n at the slice position z ref n obtained in step S is calculated image SD value calculating means .

 7 Calculate mAs z ref n Satisfying the SD z ref n at the Slice Position z ref n when the Object Size is L z ref n step S 

In this step mAs z ref n satisfying the SD z ref n at the position z ref n when the object size is L z ref n is calculated on the image SD tube current time product mAs curve as shown in tube current time product calculating means . The tube voltage condition of the image SD tube current time product mAs curve is assumed for instance as 120 kV hereinafter it is referred to as standard tube voltage xv ref .

 8 Calculate mAs Correction Coefficient and Correct mAs for Keeping CNR to be Approximately Constant Irrespective of the Tube Voltage Under the Condition of the Object Size L z ref n and mAs z ref n Step S 

Under the condition of mAs z ref n calculated in step S an mAs correction coefficient is calculated for keeping the CNR to be approximately constant irrespective of the tube voltage based on the tube voltage normalized CNR curve as shown in when the object size is L z ref n tube current time product correction coefficient calculating means . The calculation method of the mAs correction coefficient is the same as the second embodiment.

By using the mAs correction coefficient the mAs z ref n being calculated above is corrected according to the formula 9 tube current time product correction means . Hereinafter the corrected mAs is described as mAs corr n .

 9 Calculate Exposure Dose and X Ray Tube Power at the Slice Position z ref n when the Tube Current Time Product is mAs corr n step S 

The exposure dose e.g. CTDIw and X ray tube power at the slice position z ref n are calculated for each tube voltage calculated in step S after the tube current time product is corrected as mAs corr n . Data of the exposure dose is stored in advance in the storage device and kV opt n being the optimum value of the tube voltage is the voltage that minimizes the exposure dose under the condition that the X ray tube power kW satisfies kW kW max n tube voltage calculating means .

 10 Calculate mAs Satisfying SD z ref n on Other Slice Plane by Using the Optimum Tube Voltage kV opt n and Display Information such as the Image SD the Identifiable Size of the Diagnostic Object the Exposure Dose and the X Ray Tube Power Step S 

Under the condition of the optimum tube voltage xv opt n selected in step S an mAs value satisfying the SD z ref n on other slice plane is calculated by the image SD predictive function. The mAs corr z n is calculated from the tube voltage normalized CNR curve for each slice plane with the calculated mAs and the exposure dose e.g. CTDIw and X ray tube power are calculated under the imaging condition selected in step S. The mAs value being calculated as described above is used for the tube current control in the X ray controller .

Thereafter the information such as the assumed contrast value of the diagnostic object the contrast to noise ratio the optimum tube voltage the average tube current the image SD the identifiable size of the diagnostic object the exposure dose and the X ray tube power is displayed on the display device. An example of displaying these items is the same as the example shown in for instance.

In the fifth embodiment if more than one diagnostic area is set the image SD is different for each imaging region. Therefore when a three dimensional image is reconstructed a slice plane may exist where a drastic change occurs in the image SD. Accordingly it is desirable to employ a system that controls the imaging rays to make the variation of the image SD smooth on the slice planes before and after the image SD changes drastically.

According to the procedure described above it is possible to decide an imaging condition that is able to achieve the CNR appropriate for identifying the diagnostic object. It is anticipated that a lesion as a target of the diagnosis may be obviously different area by area and an appropriate condition can be set for each imaging region. Accordingly it is possible to reduce unnecessary exposure. The imaging condition being decided is stored in the storage device and the system controller sequentially calls the condition in association with the imaging part of the object upon scanning thereby controlling the X ray dose.

It is to be noted here that also in the four preferable embodiments from the second to the fifth similar to the first embodiment a selection means can be provided X ray condition selection means for selecting an arbitrary imaging condition from the recommended imaging condition and other imaging conditions. According to this selection means a radiologist is allowed to select the imaging condition depending on the usage purpose and this configuration renders the system more flexible.

The imaging condition as decided above is stored in the storage device and the system controller sequentially reads out the imaging condition in association with the imaging part of the object when scanning is done so as to control the imaging condition tube voltage and tube current during the scan via the X ray controller .

In the second embodiment to the fifth embodiment there is described a case where both the tube current and the tube voltage are optimized. In the present embodiment in order to allow the CNR to be a desired value irrespective of the slice position the tube voltage is not changed from the user set value but only the tube current is optimized. The present embodiment includes the following advantages 

 1 When the tube voltage is changed to the optimum tube voltage that is different from the user setting value the X ray spectrum varies thereby varying the CT value of each tissue. Since a clinical diagnosis may be conducted by using the CT value of tissue it is advantageous to prevent such variation of the CT value and

 2 It is sometimes preferable to take images at an identical tube voltage so as not to change the image impression if a current image and a past image are compared as to an identical patient.

A scanogram of the object is imaged. Since taking this scanogram image is the same as step S of the first embodiment detailed explanation will not be made tediously.

This process is the same as the process from step S S S and S of the first embodiment. An operator refers to the scanogram image and sets via the operating device an imaging region scan start position zs and scan end position ze including the diagnostic object. Here as the imaging condition of the slice position a slice thickness a top panel moving pitch a scan time a standard tube voltage a standard tube current an X rays collimation condition types of reconstruction filter function an FOV size a window condition and the like are inputted.

Similar to the steps S and S of the first embodiment the scan planning device analyzes scanogram projection data and generates an object three dimensional model of the object .

A size of the diagnostic object e.g. contrast enhanced liver cell cancer d o is inputted and set via the input unit of the operating device . Furthermore the operator inputs and sets TPF and FPF being used as a guide for diagnosis via the input unit of the operating device true positive fraction and false positive fraction setting means . The diagnostic object size is assumed as a diameter r of a circle having an area equivalent to the diagnostic object circle equivalent diameter for instance.

CNR det which allows the identification of the diagnostic object is obtained from the diagnostic object size d o inputted by the operator in step S the second contrast to noise ratio calculating means The CNR det enabling identification is calculated similar to the second embodiment by using the relationship as shown in and described in the second embodiment. According to the procedure being the same as the procedure as shown in described in the first embodiment the CNR det enabling identification is obtained which is corrected based on the slice thickness and window condition.

Calculate Image SD Z for Each Slice Plane the Image SD z Satisfying Assumed Contrast Value and CNR det on the 3D Model Being Generated Step S 

In this step according to the assumed contrast value C d considering the imaging part the object size and the like and the CNR det enabling identification calculated in step S SD Z being the image SD at each slice position is calculated in the same manner as the second embodiment by using the formula 7 image SD value calculating means .

The assumed contrast value C d indicates when assuming a situation for imaging the liver area for instance an absolute value of CT value difference between the liver cell cancer as the diagnostic object and the liver substance. Here the assumed contrast value at the liver becomes larger in proportion to the density of the contrast agent administered to a patient. In addition the larger the object size is the smaller becomes the assumed contrast value. Calculation of the assumed contrast value can be performed by using the formula 8 as described in the second embodiment.

The assumed contrast value is stored in advance in the storage device in association with a diagnostic object portion an imaging part an object physical frame and the like.

Calculate mAs Z Satisfying SD Z for Each Slice Plane when the Object Size is L Z Under the Condition of User Setting Tube Voltage kV usrset and Display the Image SD Identifiable Size of Diagnostic Object Exposure Dose X Ray Tube Power and the Like Step S 

Calculation of the mAs Z can be conducted according to the relationship between the image SD when the object size is L and the tube current time product mAs as shown in . Here depending on the object size for each slice position the mAs value for achieving the CNR d may exceed the marginal performance range of the X ray CT apparatus. In this case modification is made to achieve a CNR which is close to the CNR d as possible and scanning is performed at a limit value within the marginal performance range of the device. Then for the operator it is also possible to clearly demonstrate the slice position which is not able to achieve the CNR det enabling identification by highlighting on the display device as shown in . It is further possible not to demand the marginal performance of the device in the area other than the focused slice position designated by the operator.

By employing the method described above the operator can check in advance a position where the CNR d is not guaranteed on the image being displayed. In addition since the settings are configured so that the marginal performance of the device is not demanded depending on the slice position unnecessary exposure is suppressed enabling a further reduction of exposure dose.

Then the imaging condition of the diagnostic object having been obtained as described above is displayed on the display device such as the assumed contrast value the contrast to noise ratio the image SD the identifiable size d o of the diagnostic object the exposure dose CTDIw the tube voltage the average tube current a value obtained by dividing mAs value by scan time and the X ray tube power kW . On this occasion the relationship between the exposure dose and the X ray tube power is as shown in and at the slice position where the object size becomes smaller both the exposure dose and X ray tube power also become smaller.

As thus described the recommended imaging condition being optimized by the present embodiment and the condition following a conventional imaging condition without optimization are shown side by side for the operator. Therefore it is possible to clearly present a different point of the X ray recommended condition optimized by the present embodiment.

The present embodiment allows a setting of imaging condition enabling an attainment of a CNR appropriate for identifying the diagnostic object under the tube voltage condition set by a user. The imaging condition determined as thus described is stored in the storage device . Then while the system controller calls the condition sequentially in association with an imaging part of the object upon scanning the X ray controller carries out scanning by using the tube current obtained by dividing the mAs value by the scan time according to the mAs value calculated in association with each slice position.

Similar to the first embodiment in the other five preferable embodiments from the second to the sixth the devices such as the system controller the scan planning device and the operating device for executing the aforementioned functions and processing can be implemented by a configuration that operates according to computer programs the configuration combining a processor computer memory storage device register timing control interruption communication interface I O signal interface and the like. The present invention is not limited to the examples of the five preferable embodiments from the second to the sixth and it should be understood the disclosed embodiment is susceptible of changes and modifications without departing from the scope of the invention.
