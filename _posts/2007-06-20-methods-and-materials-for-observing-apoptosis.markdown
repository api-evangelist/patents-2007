This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60 814 955 filed Jun. 20 2006 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention relates generally to methods for observing apoptosis in mammalian cells such as human cancer cells exposed to an apoptosis inducing agent.

Control of cell numbers in mammals is determined in part by a balance between cell proliferation and cell death. One form of cell death sometimes referred to as necrotic cell death is typically characterized as a pathologic form of cell death resulting from some trauma or cellular injury. In contrast there is another physiologic form of cell death which usually proceeds in an orderly or controlled manner. This orderly or controlled form of cell death is often referred to as apoptosis see e.g. Barr et al. 12 487 493 1994 Steller et al. 267 1445 1449 1995 . Apoptotic cell death naturally occurs in many physiological processes including embryonic development and clonal selection in the immune system Itoh et al. 66 233 243 1991 .

Various molecules such as tumor necrosis factor TNF tumor necrosis factor TNF or lymphotoxin lymphotoxin LT CD30 ligand CD27 ligand CD40 ligand OX 40 ligand 4 1BB ligand Apo 1 ligand also referred to as Fas ligand or CD95 ligand Apo 2 ligand also referred to as TRAIL Apo 3 ligand also referred to as TWEAK osteoprotegerin OPG APRIL RANK ligand also referred to as TRANCE and TALL 1 also referred to as BlyS BAFF or THANK have been identified as members of the tumor necrosis factor TNF family of cytokines See e.g. Gruss and Dower 85 3378 3404 1995 Pitti et al. 271 12687 12690 1996 Wiley et al. 3 673 682 1995 Browning et al. 72 847 856 1993 Armitage et al. 357 80 82 1992 WO 97 01633 published Jan. 16 1997 WO 97 25428 published Jul. 17 1997 Marsters et al. 8 525 528 1998 Simonet et al. 89 309 319 1997 Chicheportiche et al. 272 32401 32410 1997 Hahne et al. 188 1185 1190 1998 WO98 28426 published Jul. 2 1998 WO98 46751 published Oct. 22 1998 WO 98 18921 published May 7 1998 Moore et al. 285 260 263 1999 Shu et al. 65 680 1999 Schneider et al. 189 1747 1756 1999 Mukhopadhyay et al. 274 15978 15981 1999 . Among these molecules TNF TNF CD30 ligand 4 1BB ligand Apo 1 ligand Apo 2 ligand Apo2L TRAIL and Apo 3 ligand TWEAK have been reported to be involved in apoptotic cell death. Both TNF and TNF have been reported to induce apoptotic death in susceptible tumor cells Schmid et al. 83 1881 1986 Dealtry et al. 17 689 1987 .

Additional molecules believed to be members of the TNF cytokine family are reported to be involved in apoptosis. For instance in Pitti et al. 271 12687 12690 1996 a molecule referred to as Apo 2 ligand is described. See also WO 97 25428 published Jul. 17 1997. The full length human Apo 2 ligand is reported to be a 281 amino acid polypeptide that induces apoptosis in various mammalian cells. Other investigators have described related polypeptides referred to as TRAIL Wiley et al. 3 673 682 1995 WO 97 01633 published Jan. 16 1997 and AGP 1 WO 97 46686 published Dec. 11 1997 .

Various molecules in the TNF family also have purported role s in the function or development of the immune system Gruss et al. 85 3378 1995 . Zheng et al. have reported that TNF is involved in post stimulation apoptosis of CD8 positive T cells Zheng et al. 377 348 351 1995 . Other investigators have reported that CD30 ligand may be involved in deletion of self reactive T cells in the thymus Amakawa et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Symposium on Programmed Cell Death Abstr. No. 10 1995 . CD40 ligand activates many functions of B cells including proliferation immunoglobulin secretion and survival Renshaw et al. 180 1889 1994 . Another recently identified TNF family cytokine TALL 1 BlyS has been reported under certain conditions to induce B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion. Moore et al. supra Schneider et al. supra Mackay et al. 190 1697 1999 .

Mutations in the mouse Fas Apo 1 receptor or ligand genes called lpr and gld respectively have been associated with some autoimmune disorders indicating that Apo 1 ligand may play a role in regulating the clonal deletion of self reactive lymphocytes in the periphery Krammer et al. 6 279 289 1994 Nagata et al. 267 1449 1456 1995 . Apo 1 ligand is also reported to induce post stimulation apoptosis in CD4 positive T lymphocytes and in B lymphocytes and may be involved in the elimination of activated lymphocytes when their function is no longer needed Krammer et al. supra Nagata et al. supra . Agonist mouse monoclonal antibodies specifically binding to the Apo 1 receptor have been reported to exhibit cell killing activity that is comparable to or similar to that of TNF Yonehara et al. 169 1747 1756 1989 .

Induction of various cellular responses mediated by such TNF family ligands is typically initiated by their binding to specific cell receptors. Some but not all TNF family ligands bind to and induce various biological activity through cell surface death receptors to activate caspases or enzymes that carry out the cell death or apoptosis pathway Salvesen et al. 91 443 446 1997 . Included among the members of the TNF receptor superfamily identified to date are TNFR1 TNFR2 TACI GITR CD27 OX 40 CD30 CD40 HVEM Fas also referred to as Apo 1 or CD95 DR4 also referred to as TRAIL R1 DR5 also referred to as Apo 2 or TRAIL R2 DcR1 DcR2 osteoprotegerin OPG RANK. and Apo 3 also referred to as DR3 or TRAMP see e.g. Ashkenazi 2 420 430 2002 Ashkenazi and Dixit 281 1305 1308 1998 Ashkenazi and Dixit 11 255 260 2000 Golstein 7 750 753 1997 Wallach Academic Press 2000 pages 377 411 Locksley et al. 104 487 501 2001 Gruss and Dower Blood 85 3378 3404 1995 HohMan et al. 264 14927 14934 1989 Brockhaus et al. 87 3127 3131 1990 EP 417 563 published Mar. 20 1991 Loetscher et al. 61 351 1990 Schall et al. 61 361 1990 Smith et al 248 1019 1023 1990 Lewis al. 88 2830 2834 1991 Goodwin et al. 11 3020 3026 1991 Stamenkovic et al. 8 1403 1410 1989 Mallett al. 9 1063 1068 1990 Anderson

Most of these TNF receptor family members share the typical structure of cell surface receptors including extracellular transmembrane and intracellular regions while others are found naturally as soluble proteins lacking a transmembrane and intracellular domain. The extracellular portion of typical TNFRs contains a repetitive amino acid sequence pattern of multiple cysteine rich domains CRDs starting from the NH terminus.

The ligand referred to as Apo 2L or TRAIL was identified several years ago as a member of the TNF family of cytokines. see e.g. Wiley et al. Immunity 3 673 682 1995 Pitti et al. J. Biol. Chem. 271 12697 12690 1996 WO 97 01633 WO 97 25428 U.S. Pat. No. 5 763 223 issued Jun. 9 1998 U.S. Pat. No. 6 284 236 issued Sep. 4 2001 . The full length native sequence human Apo2L TRAIL polypeptide is a 281 amino acid long Type II transmembrane protein. Some cells can produce a natural soluble form of the polypeptide through enzymatic cleavage of the polypeptide s extracellular region Mariani et al. J. Cell. Biol. 137 221 229 1997 .

Crystallographic studies of soluble forms of Apo2L TRAIL reveal a homotrimeric structure similar to the structures of TNF and other related proteins Hymowitz et al. 4 563 571 1999 Cha et al. 11 253 261 1999 Mongkolsapaya et al. 6 1048 1999 Hymowitz et al. Biochemistry 39 633 644 2000 . Apo2L TRAIL unlike other TNF family members however was found to have a unique structural feature in that three cysteine residues at position 230 of each subunit in the homotrimer together coordinate a zinc atom and that the zinc binding is important for trimer stability and biological activity. Hymowitz et al. supra Bodmer et al. J. Biol. Chem. 275 20632 20637 2000 .

It has been reported in the literature that Apo2L TRAIL may play a role in immune system modulation including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis see e.g. Thomas et al. J. Immunol. 161 2195 2200 1998 Johnsen et al. Cytokine 11 664 672 1999 Griffith et al. J. Exp. Med. 189 1343 1353 1999 Song et al. J. Exp. Med. 191 1095 1103 2000 .

Soluble forms of Apo2L TRAIL have also been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells including colon lung breast prostate bladder kidney ovarian and brain tumors as well as melanoma leukemia and multiple myeloma see e.g. Wiley et al. supra Pitti et al. supra U.S. Pat. No. 6 030 945 issued Feb. 29 2000 U.S. Pat. No. 6 746 668 issued Jun. 8 2004 Rieger et al. FEBS Letters 427 124 128 1998 Ashkenazi et al. J. Clin. Invest. 104 155 162 1999 Walczak et al. Nature Med. 5 157 163 1999 Keane et al. Cancer Research 59 734 741 1999 Mizutani et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 5 2605 2612 1999 Gazitt Leukemia 13 1817 1824 1999 Yu et al. Cancer Res. 60 2384 2389 2000 Chinnaiyan et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 97 1754 1759 2000 . In vivo studies in murine tumor models further suggest that Apo2L TRAIL alone or in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy can exert substantial anti tumor effects see e.g. Ashkenazi et al. supra Walczak et al. supra Gliniak et al. Cancer Res. 59 6153 6158 1999 Chinnaiyan et al. supra Roth et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 265 1999 1999 PCT Application US 00 15512 PCT Application US 01 23691 . In contrast to many types of cancer cells most normal human cell types appear to be resistant to apoptosis induction by certain recombinant forms of Apo2L TRAIL Ashkenazi et al. supra Walczak et al. supra . Jo et al. has reported that a polyhistidine tagged soluble form of Apo2L TRAIL induced apoptosis in vitro in normal isolated human but not non human hepatocytes Jo et al. Nature Med. 6 564 567 2000 see also Nagata Nature Med. 6 502 503 2000 . It is believed that certain recombinant Apo2L TRAIL preparations may vary in terms of biochemical properties and biological activities on diseased versus normal cells depending for example on the presence or absence of tag molecule zinc content and trimer content See Lawrence et al. Nature Med. Letter to the Editor 7 383 385 2001 Qin et al. Nature Med. Letter the Editor 7 385 386 2001 .

Apo2L TRAIL has been found to bind at least five different receptors. At least two of the receptors which bind Apo2L TRAIL contain a functional cytoplasmic death domain. One such receptor has been referred to as DR4 and alternatively as TR4 or TRAIL R1 Pan et al. 276 111 113 1997 see also WO98 32856 published Jul. 30 1998 WO99 37684 published Jul. 29 1999 WO 00 73349 published Dec. 7 2000 US 2003 0036168 published Feb. 20 2003 U.S. Pat. No. 6 433 147 issued Aug. 13 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 461 823 issued Oct. 8 2002 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 342 383 issued Jan. 29 2002 .

Another such receptor for Apo2L TRAIL has been referred to a DR5 it has also been alternatively referred to as Apo 2 TRAIL R. or TRAIL R2 TR6 Tango 63 hAPO8 TRICK2 or KILLER see e.g. Sheridan et al. 277 818 821 1997 Pan et al. 277 815 818 1997 WO98 51793 published Nov. 19 199 WO98 41629 published Sep. 24 1998 Screaton et al. 7 693 696 1997 Walcak et al. 16 5386 5387 1997 Wu et al. 17 141 143 1997 WO98 35986 published Aug. 20 1998 EP870 827 published Oct. 14 1998 WO98 46643 published Oct. 22 1998 WO99 02653 published Jan. 21 1999 WO99 09165 published Feb. 25 1999 WO99 11791 published Mar. 11 1999 WO 03 042367 published May 22 2003 WO 02 097033 published Dec. 5 2002 WO 03 038043 published May 8 2003 US 2002 0072091 published Aug. 13 2002 US 2002 0098550 published Dec. 7 2001 U.S. Pat. No. 6 313 269 issued Dec. 6 2001 US 2001 0010924 published Aug. 2 2001 US 2003 01255540 published Jul. 3 2003 US 2002 0160446 published Oct. 31 2002 US 2002 0048785 published Apr. 25 2.002 US 2004 0141952 published Jul. 21 2004 US 2005 0129699 published Jun. 16 2005 US 2005 0129616 published Jun. 16 2005 U.S. Pat. No. 6 342 369 issued February 2002 U.S. Pat. No. 6 569 642 issued May 27 2003 U.S. Pat. No. 6 072 047 issued Jun. 6 2000 U.S. Pat. No. 6 642 358 issued Nov. 4 2003 U.S. Pat. No. 6 743 625 issued Jun. 1 2004 . Like DR4 DR5 is reported to contain a cytoplasmic death domain and be capable of signaling apoptosis upon ligand binding or upon binding a molecule such as an agonist antibody which mimics the activity of the ligand . The crystal structure of the complex formed between Apo 2L TRAIL and DR5 is described in Hymowitz al. 4 563 571 1999 . Another identified death domain containing receptor is termed DR6 Pan et al. 431 351 356 1998 .

Upon ligand binding both DR4 and DR5 can trigger apoptosis independently by recruiting and activating the apoptosis initiator caspase 8 through the death domain containing adaptor molecule referred to as FADD Mortl Kischkel et 1 12 611 620 2000 Sprick et al. Immunity 12 599 609 2000 Bodmer 2 241 243 2000 .

Apo2L TRAIL has been reported to also bind those receptors referred to as DcR1 DcR2 and OPG which believed to function as inhibitors rather than transducers of signaling see. e.g. DCR1 also referred as TRID LIT or TRAIL R3 Pan et al. 276 111 113 1997 Sheridan et al. 277 818 821 1997 McFarlane et al. 272 25417 25420 1997 Schneider et al. 416 329 334 1997 Degli Esposti et al. 186 1165 1170 1997 and Mongkolsapaya et al. 160 3 6 1998 DCR2 also called TRUNDD or TRAIL R4 Marsters et al. 7 1003 1006 1997 Pan et al. 424 41 45 1998 Degli Esposti et al. 7 813 820 1997 and OPG Simonet et al. supra . In contrast to DR4 and DR5 the DcR1 and DcR2 receptors do not signal apoptosis.

Certain antibodies which bind to the DR4 DR5 and or Fas receptors have been reported in the literature. For example anti DR4 antibodies directed to the DR4 receptor and having agonistic or apoptotic activity in certain mammalian cells are described in e.g. WO 99 37684 published Jul. 29 1999 WO 00 73349 published Jul. 12 2000 WO 03 066661 published Aug. 14 2003. See also e.g. Griffith et al. 162 2597 2605 1999 Chuntharapai et al. 166 4891 4898 2001 WO 02 097033 published Dec. 2 2002 WO 03 042367 published May 22 2003 WO 03 038043 published May 8 2003 WO 03 037913 published May 8 2003 US 2003 0073187 published Apr. 17 2003 US 2003 0108516 published Jun. 12 2003. Certain anti DR5 antibodies have likewise been described see e.g. WO 98 51793 published Nov. 8 1998 Griffith et al. 162 2597 2605 1999 Ichikawa et al. 7 954 960 2001 Hylander et al.

In addition certain antibodies having cross reactivity to both DR4 and DR5 receptors have been described see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 252 050 issued Jun. 26 2001 . Agonist anti Fas antibodies which induce apoptosis of target cells expressing Fas include but are not limited to MAbs M2 and M3 IgG Alderson et al. 1995 J. Exp. Med. 181 71 77 anti Fas MAb IgM Yonehara et al. 1989 J. Exp. Med. 169 1747 1756 MAb CH11 IgM Alderson et al. 1994 Int. Immunol. 6 1799 806 and anti APO 1 IgG Dhein et al. 1992 J. Immunol. 149 3166 3173 .

Apoptosis plays crucial roles in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms see e.g. Danial N. N. et. al. 116 205 19 2004 . Two major signaling mechanisms the cell intrinsic and extrinsic pathways control apoptosis induction see e.g. Strasser A. et. al. 69 217 45 2000 . These pathways activate cysteine proteases called caspases which cleave various cellular proteins that are essential for cell integrity. Caspases recognize specific tetrapeptide sequences containing aspartate and cleave the adjacent peptide bond see e.g. Thornberry N. A. et. al. 281 1312 6 1998 . Activation of the cell extrinsic pathway occurs in response to ligands such as Fas ligand FasL and Apo2 ligand TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand Apo2L TRAIL through their respective cell surface death receptors Fas Apo1 CD95 and DR4 or DR5 see e.g. Nagata S. 88 355 65 1997 and LeBlanc H. N. et. al. 10 66 75 2003 . Ligand binding triggers recruitment of the adaptor FADD Fas associated death domain to a death domain within the receptor s cytoplasmic tail. FADD recruits the initiator protease caspase 8 to form the death inducing signaling complex DISC see e.g. Kischkel F. C. et al. 14 5579 88 1995 . Proximity of caspase 8 molecules in the DISC stimulates enzymatic activity resulting in self processing see e.g. Boatright K. M. et al. 11 529 41 2003 . Cleaved caspase 8 then releases from the DISC to the cytoplasm and proteolytically activates effector caspases such as caspase 3 and 7. In certain cell types DR stimulation generates strong caspase 8 activity which robustly activates effector caspases and commits the cell to apoptosis see e.g. Scaffidi C. et. al. 274 1541 8 1999 . Other cell types require signal amplification by the intrinsic pathway caspase 8 cleaves the Bcl 2 homology domain 3 BH3 only protein Bid which engages the intrinsic pathway through the multi BH domain proteins Bax and Bak enhancing effector caspase activation and apoptosis see e.g. Danial N. N. et. al. 116 205 19 2004 and Strasser A. et. al. 69 217 45 2000 .

Apoptosis is commonly characterized by condensation and margination of nuclear chromatin and fragmentation of nuclear structure into so called apoptotic bodies. This apoptotic morphology can be observed using conventional stains dyes which selectively accumulate in nuclei such as propidium iodide or Hoechst 33258 or by electron microscopy. Internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA which is often linked to but is not diagnostic for cell death by apoptosis is also used to identify and quantify apoptosis.

Applicants have identified protein fragments generated in cells undergoing apoptosis which can be used as biomarkers of apoptotic cell death. Embodiments of the invention provide methods and materials for observing these protein fragments in order to for example observe apoptotic cell death in mammalian cells exposed to one or more apoptosis inducing agents. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention these biomarkers of apoptosis are observed in human cancer cells order to examine the efficacy of a therapy comprising the administration of an apoptosis inducing agent such as Apo2L TRAIL FasL or an Apo2L TRAIL or FasL agonist.

Applicants invention has a number of embodiments. One embodiment of the invention is a method of detecting apoptosis in a mammalian cell by contacting components of the cell with an antibody that binds to a protein fragment generated during apoptosis wherein the antibody binds to a protein fragment of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 determining the amount of the antibody which binds to the protein fragment generated during apoptosis and comparing the amount of antibody bound in this step with the amount of antibody which binds to the protein fragment in a mammalian cell free of apoptosis wherein if this amount is greater than the amount in the cell free of apoptosis then apoptosis is detected. Optionally the mammalian cell examined by this method is a human colon colorectal lung breast prostate bladder kidney ovarian brain melanoma leukemia or myeloma cancer cell.

As described in detail below the methods of the invention can be used to observe apoptosis initiated by a number of different cellular receptors. In some embodiments of this method apoptosis in the cell is initiated through Death Receptor 4 SEQ ID NO 5 or Death Receptor 5 SEQ ID NO 6 for example by contacting the cell with APO2L TRAIL SEQ ID NO 7 or an antibody which binds Death Receptor 4 SEQ ID NO 5 or Death Receptor 5 SEQ ID NO 6 . In other embodiments of the invention apoptosis in the cell is initiated through Fas SEQ ID NO 8 for example by contacting the cell with FasL SEQ ID NO 9 or an antibody which bind Fas.

The methods of the invention can further be adapted for use in a number of contexts. For example these methods of observing apoptosis can be used to assess the sensitivity of a cell to Apo2L TRAIL SEQ ID NO 7 or an antibody which binds Death Receptor 4 SEQ ID NO 5 or Death Receptor 5 SEQ ID NO 6 . In a specific illustrative embodiment of the invention these methods can be used to assess the efficacy of a therapy comprising the administration of Apo2L TRAIL SEQ ID NO 7 or an antibody which binds Death Receptor 4 SEQ ID NO 5 or Death Receptor 5 SEQ ID NO 6 . Similarly other embodiments of the invention can be used to examine the sensitivity of the cell to FasL SEQ ID NO 9 or an antibody which binds Fas for example to assess the efficacy of a therapy comprising the administration of FasL SEQ ID NO 9 or an antibody which binds Fas.

As discussed in detail below the methods of the invention can observe the apoptotic fragmentation of a number of different proteins within a cell using any one of a variety of techniques known in the art such as immunoassays using antibodies directed to one or more of these apoptotic fragments. For example certain embodiments of the invention antibody binds to a protein fragment of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 for example a fragment of about 64 kDa or 33 kDa. In some embodiments of the invention the protein fragment of AP2 bound by the antibody comprises DVFD residues 684 to 687 of SEQ ID NO 1 or GPAA residues 688 to 691 of SEQ ID NO 1. Other embodiments of the invention can use an antibody that binds to a protein fragment of clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 . Other embodiments of the invention can use an antibody that binds to a protein fragment of AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 . Other embodiments of the invention can use an antibody that binds a protein fragment of dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 .

Certain embodiments of the invention are tailored to examine a specific type of apoptotic activity and or apoptosis in a specific physiological context. For example embodiments of the invention can be used to observe apoptosis in a mammalian cell mediated by Death Receptor 4 SEQ ID NO 5 Death Receptor 5 SEQ ID NO 6 or Fas SEQ ID NO 8 .

The terms apoptosis and apoptotic activity are used in a broad sense and refer to the orderly or controlled form of cell death in mammals that is typically accompanied by one or more characteristic cell changes including condensation of cytoplasm loss of plasma membrane microvilli segmentation of the nucleus degradation of chromosomal DNA or loss of mitochondrial function. This activity can be determined and measured using a number of techniques known in the art for instance by cell viability assays FACS analysis or DNA electrophoresis and more specifically by binding of annexin V fragmentation of DNA cell shrinkage dilation of endoplasmatic reticulum cell fragmentation and or formation of membrane vesicles called apoptotic bodies .

The terms Apo 2 ligand Apo 2L or TRAIL are used herein to refer to a polypeptide which includes amino acid residues 95 281 inclusive 114 281 inclusive residues 91 281 inclusive residues 92 281 inclusive residues 41 281 inclusive residues 15 281 inclusive or residues 1 281 inclusive of the amino acid sequence shown in of Pitti et al. 271 12687 12690 1996 as well as biologically active fragments deletional insertional or substitutional variants of the above sequences.

The definition encompasses Apo 2 ligand isolated from an Apo 2 ligand source such as from human tissue types or from another source or prepared by recombinant or synthetic methods. The term Apo 2 ligand also refers to the polypeptides described in WO 97 25428 supra and WO97 01633 supra.

 Apo 2 ligand receptor includes the receptors referred to in the art as DR4 and DR5 . Pan et al. have described the TNF receptor family member referred to as DR4 Pan et al. 276 111 113 1997 see also WO98 32856 published Jul. 30 1998 . The DR4 receptor was reported to contain a cytoplasmic death domain capable of engaging the cell suicide apparatus. Pan et al. disclose that DR4 is believed to be a receptor for the ligand known as Apo2L TRAIL. Sheridan et al. 277 818 821 1997 and Pan et al. 277 815 818 1997 described another receptor for Apo2L TRAIL see also WO98 51793 published Nov. 19 1998 WO98 41629 published Sep. 24 1998 . This receptor is referred to as DR5 the receptor has also been alternatively referred to as Apo 2 TRAIL R TR6 Tango 63 hAPO8 TRICK2 or KILLER Screaton et al. 7 693 696 1997 Walczak et al. 16 5386 5387 1997 Wu et al. 17 141 143 1997 WO98 35986 published Aug. 20 1998 EP870 827 published Oct. 14 1998 WO98 46643 published Oct. 22 1998 WO99 02653 published Jan. 21 1999 WO99 09165 published Feb. 25 1999 WO99 11791 published Mar. 11 1999 . Like DR4 DR5 is reported to contain a cytoplasmic death domain and be capable of signaling apoptosis. As described above other receptors for Apo 2L include DcR1 DcR2 and OPG see Sheridan et al. supra Marsters et al. supra and Simonet et al. supra . The term Apo 2L receptor when used herein encompasses native sequence receptor and receptor variants. These terms encompass Apo 2L receptor expressed in a variety of mammals including humans. Apo 2L receptor may be endogenously expressed as occurs naturally in a variety of human tissue lineages or may be expressed by recombinant or synthetic methods. A native sequence Apo 2L receptor comprises a polypeptide having the same amino acid sequence as an Apo 2L receptor derived from nature. Thus a native sequence Apo 2L receptor can have the amino acid sequence of naturally occurring Apo 2L receptor from any mammal. Such native sequence Apo 2L receptor can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. The term native sequence Apo 2L receptor specifically encompasses naturally occurring truncated or secreted forms of the receptor e.g. a soluble form containing for instance an extracellular domain sequence naturally occurring variant forms e.g. alternatively spliced forms and naturally occurring allelic variants. Receptor variants may include fragments or deletion mutants of the native sequence Apo 2L receptor.

The term Fas is used herein to refer to a polypeptide which includes amino acid residues 1 319 as shown in NCBI Accession No. AAA63174 and described in Itoh et al. Cell 66 2 233 243 1991 as well as biologically active fragments deletional insertional or substitutional variants of the above sequences. This polypeptide is designated Apo 1 and CD95 in certain art references. The term Fas Ligand or FasL is used herein to refer to a polypeptide which includes amino acid residues 1 281 as shown in NCBI Accession No. NP000630 and described in Suda et al. Cell 75 6 1169 1178 1993 as well as biologically active fragments deletional insertional or substitutional variants of the above sequences. Binding of FasL to Fas or cross linking of Fas with agonistic antibodies induces apoptosis that results in cell death see e.g. Nagata S. Ann. Rev. Genet. 33 29 1999 and Labroille et al. Cytometry 39 3 195 202 2000 . The binding of FasL to Fas activates a cascade of caspases via a FADD adaptor Fas associated protein with death domain which leads to the cleavage of various cellular substrates and to DNA fragmentation.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to the polypeptide sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in a polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN ALIGN 2 or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. Optionally amino acid sequence identity values are obtained by using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2. The ALIGN 2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech Inc. and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN 2 program is publicly available through Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. The ALIGN 2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN 2 program and do not vary. However amino acid sequence identity may also be determined using the sequence comparison program NCBI BLAST2 Altschul et al. 25 3389 3402 1997 . The NCBI BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be downloaded from http www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. NCBI BLAST2 uses several search parameters wherein all of those search parameters are set to default values including for example unmask yes strand all expected occurrences 10 minimum low complexity length 15 5 multi pass e value 0.01 constant for multi pass 25 dropoff for final gapped alignment 25 and scoring matrix BLOSUM62.

The term antibody is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers intact monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies and antibody fragments. The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to conventional polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 . The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 for example. An antibody which binds an antigen of interest is one capable of binding that antigen with sufficient affinity and or avidity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic or therapeutic agent for targeting a cell expressing the antigen.

 Death receptor antibody is used herein to refer generally to antibody or antibodies directed to a receptor in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and containing a death domain capable of signalling apoptosis and such antibodies include DR5 antibody DR4 antibody and Fas antibody.

 DR5 receptor antibody DR5 antibody or anti DR5 antibody is used in a broad sense to refer to antibodies that bind to at least one form of DR5 receptor. Optionally the DR5 antibody is fused or linked to a heterologous sequence or molecule. Preferably the heterologous sequence allows or assists the antibody to form higher order or oligomeric complexes. Optionally the DR5 antibody binds to DR5 receptor but does not bind or cross react with any additional Apo 2L receptor e.g. DR4 DcR1 or DcR2 . Optionally the antibody is an agonist of DR5 signalling activity see e.g. United States Patent Application Nos. 20040005314 and 20060188498 .

 DR4 receptor antibody DR4 antibody or anti DR4 antibody is used in a broad sense to refer to antibodies that bind to at least one form of a DR4 receptor or extracellular domain thereof. Optionally the DR4 antibody is fused or linked to heterologous sequence or molecule. Preferably the heterologous sequence allows or assists the antibody to form higher order or oligomeric complexes. Optionally the DR4 antibody binds DR4 receptor but does not bind or cross react with any additional Apo 2L receptor e.g. DR5 Dc R1 or DcR2 . Optionally the antibody is an agonist of DR4 signalling activity see e.g. United States Patent Application Nos. 20040005314 and 20060188498 .

 Fas antibody or anti Fas antibody is used in a broad sense to refer to antibodies that bind to at least one form of Fas or extracellular domain thereof. Optionally the Fas antibody is fused or linked to heterologous sequence or molecule. Preferably the heterologous sequence allows or assists the antibody to form higher order or oligomeric complexes. Optionally the Fas antibody binds Fas receptor but does not bind or cross react with any additional FasL receptor. Optionally the antibody is an agonist of Fas signalling activity see e.g. Nagata S. Ann. Rev. Genet. 33 29 1999 and Labroille et al. Cytometry 39 3 195 202 2000 .

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies immunoglobulins in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 .

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof such as Fv Fab Fab F ab or other antigen binding subsequences of antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a complementarity determining region CDR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat or rabbit having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances Fv framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Reichmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 . The humanized antibody includes a PRIMATIZED antibody wherein the antigen binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.

Antibodies are typically proteins or polypeptides which exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen. Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains. Typically each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain V followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end V and a constant domain at its other end the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains Chothia et al. 186 651 663 1985 Novotny and Haber 82 4592 4596 1985 . The light chains of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG 1 IgG 2 IgG 3 and IgG 4 IgA 1 and IgA 2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha delta epsilon gamma and mu respectively.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody generally the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

The term variable is used herein to describe certain portions of the variable domains which differ in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not usually evenly distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is typically concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions CDRs or hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat E. A. et al. National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1987 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

The monoclonal antibodies herein include chimeric hybrid and recombinant antibodies produced by splicing a variable including hypervariable domain of an anti Apo 2L receptor antibody with a constant domain e.g. humanized antibodies or a light chain with a heavy chain or a chain from one species with a chain from another species or fusions with heterologous proteins regardless of species of origin or immunoglobulin class or subclass designation as well as antibody fragments e.g. Fab F ab and Fv so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity or properties. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Mage et al. in pp. 79 97 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. In one embodiment the human antibody is selected from a phage library where that phage library expresses human antibodies Vaughan et al. 14 309 314 1996 Sheets et al. USA 95 6157 6162 1998 Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 1991 . Human antibodies can also be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals e.g. mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge human antibody production is observed which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects including gene rearrangement assembly and antibody repertoire. This approach is described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 807 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 661 016 and in the following scientific publications Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 Lonberg et al. 368 856 859 1994 Morrison 368 812 13 1994 Fishwild et al. 14 845 51 1996 Neuberger 14 826 1996 Lonberg and Huszar 13 65 93 1995 . Alternatively the human antibody may be prepared via immortalization of human B lymphocytes producing an antibody directed against a target antigen such B lymphocytes may be recovered from an individual or may have been immunized in vitro . See e.g. Cole et al. Alan R. Liss p. 77 1985 Boerner et al. 147 1 86 95 1991 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 750 373.

The term Fc region is used to define the C terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain which may be generated by papain digestion of an intact antibody. The Fc region may be a native sequence Fc region or a variant Fc region. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at about position Cys226 or from about position Pro230 to the carboxyl terminus of the Fc region using herein the numbering system according to Kabat et al. supra . The Fc region of an immunoglobulin generally comprises two constant domains a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain and optionally comprises a CH4 domain.

The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region also referred to as C 2 domain usually extends from an amino acid residue at about position 231 to an amino acid residue at about position 340. The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather two N linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG molecule. It has been speculated that the carbohydrate may provide a substitute for the domain domain pairing and help stabilize the CH2 domain. Burton 22 161 206 1985 . The CH2 domain herein may be a native sequence CH2 domain or variant CH2 domain.

The CH3 domain comprises the stretch of residues C terminal to a CH2 domain in an Fc region i.e. from an amino acid residue at about position 341 to an amino acid residue at about position 447 of an IgG . The CH3 region herein may be a native sequence CH3 domain or a variant CH3 domain e.g. a CH3 domain with an introduced protuberance in one chain thereof and a corresponding introduced cavity in the other chain thereof see U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 333 .

 Hinge region is generally defined as stretching from about Glu216 or about Cys226 to about Pro230 of human IgG1 Burton 22 161 206 1985 . Hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues forming inter heavy chain S S bonds in the same positions. The hinge region herein may be a native sequence hinge region or a variant hinge region. The two polypeptide chains of a variant hinge region generally retain at least one cysteine residue per polypeptide chain so that the two polypeptide chains of the variant hinge region can form a disulfide bond between the two chains. The preferred hinge region herein is a native sequence human hinge region e.g. a native sequence human IgG1 hinge region.

A functional Fc region possesses at least one effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary effector functions include Clq binding complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor BCR etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain e.g. an antibody variable domain and can be assessed using various assays known in the art for evaluating such antibody effector functions.

A native sequence Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. A variant Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Preferably the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80 sequence identity with a native sequence Fc region and or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide and most preferably at least about 90 sequence identity therewith more preferably at least about 95 sequence identity therewith.

The terms Fc receptor and FcR are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain reviewed in Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 .

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof which result an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and or framework residues is described by Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al 226 889 896 1992 .

The word label when used herein refers to a compound or composition which is coupled or fused directly or indirectly to a reagent such as an antibody and facilitates detection of the reagent to which it is coupled or fused. The label may itself be detectable e.g. radioisotope labels fluorescent labels or in the case of an enzymatic label may catalyze chemical alteration of substrate compound composition which is detectable.

The term antagonist is used in the broadest sense and includes any molecule that partially or fully blocks inhibits or neutralizes one or more biological activities of Apo2L TRAIL DR4 or DR5 FasL or Fas in vitro in situ or in vivo. Examples of such biological activities of Apo2L TRAIL DR4 or DR5 include binding of Apo2L TRAIL to DR4 or DR5 induction of apoptosis as well as those further reported in the literature. Examples of such biological activities of FasL and Fas include binding of FasL to Fas induction of apoptosis as well as those further reported in the literature. An antagonist may function in a direct or indirect manner. For instance the antagonist may function to partially or fully block inhibit or neutralize one or more biological activities of Apo2L TRAIL in vitro in situ or in vivo as a result of its direct binding to DR4 or DR5. The antagonist may also function indirectly to partially or fully block inhibit or neutralize one or more biological activities of Apo2L TRAIL DR4 or DR5 in vitro in situ or in vivo as a result of e.g. blocking or inhibiting another effector molecule. The antagonist molecule may comprise a dual antagonist activity wherein the molecule is capable of partially or fully blocking inhibiting or neutralizing a biological activity of Apo2L TRAIL DR4 or DR5 Fas or FasL.

The term agonist is used in the broadest sense and includes any molecule that partially or fully enhances stimulates or activates one or more biological activities of Apo2L TRAIL DR4 or DR5 FasL or Fas in vitro in situ or in vivo. Examples of such biological activities binding of Apo2L TRAIL to DR4 or DR5 apoptosis as well as those further reported in the literature. Examples of such biological activities of FasL and Fas include binding of FasL to Fas induction of apoptosis as well as those further reported in the literature. An agonist may function in a direct or indirect manner. For instance the agonist may function to partially or fully enhance stimulate or activate one or more biological activities of DR4 or DR5 in vitro in situ or in vivo as a result of its direct binding to DR4 or DR5 which causes receptor activation or signal transduction. The agonist may also function indirectly to partially or fully enhance stimulate or activate one or more biological activities of DR4 or DR5 in vitro in situ or in vivo as a result of e.g. stimulating another effector molecule which then causes DR4 or DR5 activation or signal transduction. It is contemplated that an agonist may act as an enhancer molecule which functions indirectly to enhance or increase DR4 or DR5 activation or activity. For instance the agonist may enhance activity of endogenous Apo 2L in a mammal. This could be accomplished for example by pre complexing DR4 or DR5 or by stabilizing complexes of the respective ligand with the DR4 or DR5 receptor such as stabilizing native complex formed between Apo 2L and DR4 or DR5 .

 Isolated when used to describe the various proteins disclosed herein means protein that has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the protein and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or non proteinaceous solutes.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell in vitro and or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine TAXOL and topo II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C.

Generally the methods and materials of the invention are used to detect and or monitor apoptosis in a mammalian cell for example by contacting the cell with an antibody that binds to a protein fragment generated during apoptosis wherein the antibody binds to a protein fragment of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 determining the amount of the antibody which binds to the protein fragment generated during apoptosis and then comparing the amount of antibody bound in the mammalian cell with the amount of antibody which binds to the protein fragment in a mammalian cell free of apoptosis wherein if the amount in the cell being examined is greater than the amount in the cell free of apoptosis then apoptosis is detected. As illustrated in the examples provided herein contacting the cell with an antibody that binds to a protein fragment generated during apoptosis includes methods which contact the cellular components of the cells. Typically the cell is pretreated for example by extraction e.g. as in the Western blot procedures noted herein to facilitate the antibody s contact of components of the cell.

The methods and assays disclosed herein can be used in a number of contexts. For example there are some populations of diseased human cell types such as certain populations of cancer cells which are resistant to the cell death inducing effects of Apo2L TRAIL or death receptor antibodies. It is therefore believed that the disclosed methods and assays can provide for convenient efficient and potentially cost effective means to obtain data and information useful in assessing appropriate or effective therapies for treating patients. For example a patient diagnosed with cancer or an immune related condition could have a biopsy performed to obtain a tissue or cell sample and the sample examined by various in vitro assays of the invention to determine whether a patient s cells are sensitive to a therapeutic agent such as Apo2 TRAIL or death receptor antibody.

For sample preparation a tissue or cell sample from a mammal typically a human patient may be used. Examples of samples include but are not limited to cancer cells such as colon breast prostate ovary lung stomach pancreas lymphoma and leukemia cancer cells. Optionally the samples include non small cell lung cancer cells pancreatic cancer cells or non Hodgkin s lymphoma cancer cells. The sample can be obtained by a variety of procedures known in the art including but not limited to surgical excision aspiration or biopsy.

The invention disclosed herein has a number of embodiments. For example certain embodiments of the invention can be used to observe cell apoptosis and associated conditions in a subject such as a mammal and in particular a human subject. In one illustrative embodiment methods of the invention are used to observe the presence or absence of apoptosis in mammalian cells in order to examine the sensitivity of a mammalian cell to one or more apoptosis inducing agents such as Apo2 TRAIL or FasL for example to assess the efficacy of a therapy comprising the administration of such agents. The methods of the present invention can also be used to determine the extent of activity of a candidate compound in decreasing or increasing the apoptotic activity in a mammalian cell for example one which modulates the activity of an apoptosis inducing agent such as Apo2L TRAIL SEQ ID NO 7 FasL SEQ ID NO 9 a Fas agonist antibody a DR4 agonist antibody or a DR5 agonist antibody. Embodiments of the invention are also useful for identification of compounds which inhibit or stimulate apoptotic cell death by determining that the compounds inhibits or stimulates the formation of apoptosis generated protein fragments.

A typical embodiment of the invention is a method of detecting apoptosis in a mammalian cell by contacting the cell with an antibody that binds to a protein fragment generated during apoptosis wherein the antibody binds to a protein fragment of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 determining the amount of the antibody which binds to the protein fragment generated during apoptosis and then comparing the amount of antibody bound in the mammalian cell with the amount of antibody which binds to the protein fragment in a mammalian cell free of apoptosis wherein if the amount in this mammalian cell is greater than the amount in the cell free of apoptosis then apoptosis is detected. A wide variety of mammalian cells can be used in such methods. In certain embodiments of the invention the cell is a human colon colorectal lung breast prostate bladder kidney ovarian brain melanoma leukemia or myeloma cancer cell.

Another embodiment of the invention is a method for identifying a human cancer cell that is likely to respond or is responsive to a therapeutic agent that induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. This embodiment of the invention includes the steps of exposing the human cancer cell to the therapeutic agent examining the human cancer cell exposed to the therapeutic agent for the presence of a protein fragment of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 comparing the amount of protein fragment in the human cancer cell with the amount of protein fragment in a control human cancer cell not exposed to the ligand. In this embodiment apoptosis is observed when the amount of protein fragment present in the human cancer cell exposed to the therapeutic agent is greater than the amount of protein fragment in the control human cancer cell not exposed to the therapeutic agent and an observation of apoptosis in the human cancer cell identifies the human cancer cell as likely to respond or responsive to the therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments of the invention the human cancer cell is obtained from an individual diagnosed with a cancer and has been grown in an in vitro culture for less than one month and typically less than 2 weeks or less than one week. In alternative embodiments the human cancer cell is an immortalized cell line obtained from an in vitro culture.

In typical embodiments of the invention the amount of antibody bound in the mammalian cell which is being observed for the presence of apoptosis for example a mammalian cell exposed to an apoptosis inducing agent is compared with the amount of antibody which binds to the protein fragment in a mammalian cell free of apoptosis for example a control cell which has not been exposed to the apoptosis inducing agent. One of skill in the art understands that such control cells are those selected to be like the experimental mammalian cell which is being observed for the presence of apoptosis except for the variable being tested e.g. exposure to an apoptosis inducing agent . In one embodiment of the invention the control cell is a cell from the same source e.g. a biopsy sample from the site of a primary or metastatic tumor and or is of the same lineage as the experimental mammalian cell which is being observed for the presence of apoptosis except that the control mammalian cell is not exposed to an agent that initiates signalling of Death Receptor 4 SEQ ID NO 5 Death Receptor 5 SEQ ID NO 6 or Fas SEQ ID NO 8 . In certain embodiments of the invention the pattern of fragmentation of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 in such control cells has already been characterized and it is this previously characterized pattern of fragmentation in the control cell that is compared to the pattern of fragmentation of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 in the mammalian cell which is being observed for the presence of apoptosis. Such embodiments are used for example in order to eliminate unnecessary and redundant characterizations of cellular controls for example controls characterized as cells being free of apoptosis.

Embodiments of the invention can be used to examine cells undergoing apoptosis induced by any of the wide variety of factors known to initiate this programmed cell death for example heat radiation and chemical agents. These embodiments typically observe apoptosis in the cell that initiated through a receptor on the surface of the cell for example Death Receptor 4 SEQ ID NO 5 Death Receptor 5 SEQ ID NO 6 or Fas SEQ ID NO 8 . In certain embodiments of the invention the cell is contacted with a polypeptide such as Apo2L TRAIL SEQ ID NO 7 FasL SEQ ID NO 9 a Fas agonist antibody a DR4 agonist antibody or a DR5 agonist antibody and the described methods for the detection of apoptosis which include the detection of no apoptosis are used for example to obtain information on the efficacy of a therapy comprising the administration of such agents.

The methods of the invention can also be used to identify new apoptosis inducing agents and or modulators of apoptosis inducing agents. Illustrative embodiments can include the step of exposing the mammalian cell to one or more test agents and then using methods of the invention to observe apoptosis with detection of apoptosis in the mammalian cell identifying the one or more test agents as an inducer of apoptosis in the mammalian cell. Methods of the invention can also be combined with complimentary methods of cellular analysis for example genetic profiling. One such embodiment of the invention includes the step of examining the expression of at least one mRNA in the mammalian cell in which apoptosis is observed.

Method of the invention include observations of cellular proteins that are shown herein to fragment in cells undergoing apoptosis. These protein fragment for example fragments of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 can be observed by any one of a wide variety of assays known in the art. Typically such fragments are observed using immunoblotting an enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay or immunohistochemistry. In addition the methods of the invention can be used to examine a number of the protein fragments identified herein for example a protein fragment of AP2 having a molecular weight of about 64 kDa or 33 kDa. In certain embodiments of the invention the protein fragment bound by the antibody is identified by amino acid sequences specific to that fragment for example AP2 amino acid sequences DVFD residues 684 to 687 of SEQ ID NO 1 or GPAA residues 688 to 691 of SEQ ID NO 1.

As noted above embodiments of the present invention include methods of determining if a human patient diagnosed with cancer is likely to respond to treatment with one or more apoptosis inducing agents for example APO 2 TRAIL. These methods can be adapted to be used with a variety of other methods known in the art that facilitate the determination of whether a patient diagnosed with cancer is likely to respond to treatment with an agent s such as an apoptosis inducing agent for example those methods which examining the expression of at least one gene e.g. the presence or level of the mRNA or protein encoded by that mRNA in a human patient diagnosed with cancer e.g. in a primary tumor or a metastasis . Such genetic profiling methods are well known in the art and described for example in U.S. Patent Application No. 20060015952 .

One such embodiment of the methods of the invention can include the step of observing fragments generated during apoptosis including protein fragments of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 in cancer cells obtained from the patient in combination with the step of obtaining a gene expression profile of multiple genes and comparing it with a gene expression profile of a noncancerous cell of the same lineage and or cancer cells obtained from an animal model that are know to be responsive or alternatively unresponsive to treatment with one or more apoptosis inducing agents. Typically such methods can include the step of further identifying the patient as likely to benefit from treatment with one or more apoptosis inducing agents for example if the cancer cells obtained from the patient have a gene expression profile similar to the gene expression profile of cancer cells obtained from patients or an animal model of the cancer that are known to benefit from treatment with the one or more apoptosis inducing agents.

For purposes herein similar means that the expression profiles resemble or track each other in one or more ways by showing patterns of expression that are within about 80 to 100 identical in quantity or other measurable expression parameter depending on the assay or technique used to measure the gene expression profile as described further below in detail more preferably within about 90 to 100 and more preferably within about 95 to 100 identical. The gene expression profiles of the cancer cells from the patient and from the animal model are generally obtained by the same technique or assay to facilitate comparison thereof.

Methods of gene expression profiling are well known in the art and are typically based either on hybridization analysis of polynucleotides or sequencing of polynucleotides. The most commonly used methods known in the art for the quantification of mRNA expression in a sample include northern blotting and in situ hybridization Parker and Barnes Methods in Molecular Biology 106 247 283 1999 RNAse protection assays Hod Biotechniques 13 852 854 1992 and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR Weis et al. Trends in Genetics 8 263 264 1992 . Alternatively antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes including DNA duplexes RNA duplexes and DNA RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA protein duplexes. Representative methods for sequencing based gene expression analysis include Serial Analysis of Gene Expression SAGE and gene expression analysis by massively parallel signature sequencing MPSS . Any of these methods or other methods known in the art can be used to determine the gene expression profile of a tumor cell obtained from a patient such as a human patient and an animal serving as a model of a cancer responsive to a TGF antagonist such as a mouse model. In the case of human patients the source of tumor cells can be a fresh frozen or fixed and paraffin embedded tissue sample from which mRNA can be extracted and subjected to gene expression analysis.

Alternatively proteomics techniques can also be used to compare the expression profile of a human and reference e.g. mouse proteins in a cancer cell. A proteomic profile is a representation of the expression pattern of a plurality of proteins in a biological sample e.g. a cancer tissue. The expression profile can for example be represented as a mass spectrum but other representations based on any physicochemical or biochemical properties of the proteins are also included. Thus the expression profile may for example be based on differences in the electrophoretic properties of proteins as determined by two dimensional gel electrophoresis e.g. by 2 D PAGE and can be represented e.g. as a plurality of spots in a two dimensional electrophoresis gel. Proteomics techniques are well known in the art and are described for example in the following textbooks Proteome Research New Frontiers in Functional Genomics Principles and Practice M. R. Wilkins et al. eds.

Protein fragments generated during apoptosis including protein fragments of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 in a sample can be analyzed by a number of means well known in the art. Typical protocols for evaluating such protein fragments are found for example in Ausubel et al. eds. 1995 Current Protocols In Molecular Biology Unit 15 Immunoblotting . Immunoassays which can be used in certain embodiments of the present invention include but are not limited to Western blots immunoprecipitation slot or dot blot assays immunostaining RIA scintillation proximity assays fluorescent immunoassays using antibody conjugates or antigen conjugates of fluorescent substances such as fluorescein or rhodamine Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis ELISA cell based ELISA filter binding ELISA inhibition ELISA and immunoassays employing an avidin biotin or a streptavidin biotin detection system.

In some embodiments of the invention an antibody used in the immunoassay binds to both the intact protein and a protein fragment and the protein fragment is recognized by its characteristically smaller size for example in a Western blot procedure. For example the antibody used in an embodiment of the invention can be one of the exemplary antibodies disclosed herein or an antibody which binds to an epitope bound by one of the exemplary antibodies disclosed herein. In other embodiments of the invention antibodies which specifically recognize apoptosis generated protein fragments but not intact proteins can be used. Such antibodies can be prepared by standard immunization methods using the fragment as the immunogen and then identifying those antibodies generated that bind apoptosis generated protein fragments but not intact protein.

In typical embodiments of the present invention analysis is performed on proteins obtained from lysed cells which have been separated by means of SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE . The proteins are contacted with an antibody and analysis is performed preferably by immunoassay to determine the presence of protein fragments which bind to the antibody. Comparison may be made to a control consisting of proteins from similar lysed cells e.g. cells from the same source and or lineage known to be free of apoptosis. Any of the immunoassays described above can be used to analyze a tissue sample from a live subject. Possible biological samples for this analysis include blood cells or biopsied cell or tissue samples which can be obtained by standard methods. The levels of apoptosis generated peptide fragments in the above described biological samples can be determined in any of the immunoassays described above employing antibodies that bind specifically to protein fragments of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 . The level of apoptosis generated peptide fragments determined in the biological sample from the subject being analyzed is compared to the level found in an unaffected patient cell or in a known standard. An exemplary standard can be for example the presence and or concentration of one or more protein fragments typically observed in cells not undergoing apoptosis e.g. in control cells not exposed to an apoptosis inducing agent . Such embodiments can be used for example to diagnose conditions characterized by abnormal apoptosis. In certain embodiments of the invention a level of apoptosis is observed within the cell with for example an increase in apoptosis generated peptide fragments of at least 10 20 30 40 or percent 100 or 150 percent compared to a control sample considered indicative of a pathological condition. In other embodiments of the invention a level of apoptosis is observed within the cell with for example an increase in apoptosis generated peptide fragments of at least 10 fold 100 fold or 1000 fold compared to a control sample considered indicative of a pathological condition.

Embodiments of the invention can be adapted for use in immunological assays useful for the detection and quantification of protein fragments of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 . Such assays can comprise one or more antibodies capable of recognizing and binding a protein fragment as appropriate. These assays are performed within various immunological assay formats well known in the art including but not limited to various types of Western blot assays radioimmunoassays enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISA enzyme linked immunofluorescent assays ELIFA and the like.

In illustrative methods the sample may be contacted with an antibody specific for a biomarker such as a protein fragment of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 under conditions sufficient for an antibody biomarker complex to form and then detecting said complex. Detecting the presence of a protein fragment biomarker may be accomplished in a number of ways such as by Western blotting with or without an immunoprecipitation step and ELISA procedures for assaying wide variety of tissues and samples including plasma or serum. A wide range of immunoassay techniques using such an assay format are available see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 016 043 4 424 279 and 4 018 653. These include both single site and two site or sandwich assays of the non competitive types as well as in the traditional competitive binding assays. These assays also include direct binding of labelled antibody to a target biomarker.

Sandwich assays are among the most useful and commonly used assays. A number of variations of the sandwich assay technique exist and all are intended to be encompassed by the present invention. Briefly in a typical forward assay an unlabelled antibody is immobilized on a solid substrate and the sample to be tested brought into contact with the bound molecule. After a suitable period of incubation for a period of time sufficient to allow formation of an antibody antigen complex a second antibody specific to the antigen labelled with a reporter molecule capable of producing a detectable signal is then added and incubated allowing time sufficient for the formation of another complex of antibody antigen labelled antibody. Any unreacted material is washed away and the presence of the antigen is determined by observation of a signal produced by the reporter molecule. The results may either be qualitative by simple observation of the visible signal or may be quantitated by comparing with a control sample containing known amounts of biomarker.

Variations on the forward assay include a simultaneous assay in which both sample and labelled antibody are added simultaneously to the bound antibody. These techniques are well known to those skilled in the art including any minor variations as will be readily apparent. In a typical forward sandwich assay a first antibody having specificity for the biomarker is either covalently or passively bound to a solid surface. The solid surface is typically glass or a polymer the most commonly used polymers being cellulose polyacrylamide nylon polystyrene polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene. The solid supports may be in the form of tubes beads discs of microplates or any other surface suitable for conducting an immunoassay. The binding processes are well known in the art and generally consist of cross linking covalently binding physically adsorbing the polymer antibody complex is washed in preparation for the test sample. An aliquot of the sample to tested is then added to the solid phase complex and incubated for a period of time sufficient e.g. 2 40 minutes or overnight if more convenient and under suitable conditions e.g. from room temperature to 40 C. such as between 25 C. and 32 C. inclusive to allow binding of any subunit present in the antibody. Following the incubation period the antibody subunit solid phase is washed and dried and incubated with a second antibody specific for a portion of the biomarker. The second antibody is linked to a reporter molecule which is used to indicate the binding of the second antibody to the molecular marker.

An alternative method involves immobilizing a target biomarker in the sample and then exposing the immobilized target to specific antibody which may or may not be labelled with a reporter molecule. Depending on the amount of target and the strength of the reporter molecule signal a bound target may be detectable by direct labelling with the antibody. Alternatively a second labelled antibody specific to the first antibody is exposed to the target first antibody complex to form a target first antibody second antibody tertiary complex. The complex is detected by the signal emitted by the reporter molecule. By reporter molecule as used in the present specification is meant a molecule which by its chemical nature provides an analytically identifiable signal which allows the detection of antigen bound antibody. The most commonly used reporter molecules in this type of assay are either enzymes fluorophores or radionuclide containing molecules i.e. radioisotopes and chemiluminescent molecules.

In the case of an enzyme immunoassay an enzyme is conjugated to the second antibody generally by means of glutaraldehyde or periodate. As will be readily recognized however a wide variety of different conjugation techniques exist which are readily available to the skilled artisan. Commonly used enzymes include horseradish peroxidase glucose oxidase galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase amongst others. The substrates to be used with the specific enzymes are generally chosen for the production upon hydrolysis by the corresponding enzyme of a detectable color change. Examples of suitable enzymes include alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase. It is also possible to employ fluorogenic substrates which yield a fluorescent product rather than the chromogenic substrates noted above. In typical cases the enzyme labelled antibody is added to the first antibody molecular marker complex allowed to bind and then the excess reagent is washed away. A solution containing the appropriate substrate is then added to the complex of antibody antigen antibody. The substrate will react with the enzyme linked to the second antibody giving a qualitative visual signal which may be further quantitated usually spectrophotometrically to give an indication of the amount of biomarker which was present in the sample. Alternately fluorescent compounds such as fluorescein and rhodamine may be chemically coupled to antibodies without altering their binding capacity. When activated by illumination with light of particular wavelength the fluorochrome labelled antibody adsorbs the light energy inducing a state to excitability in the molecule followed by emission of the light at characteristic color visually detectable with a light microscope. As in the EIA the fluorescent labelled antibody is allowed to bind to the first antibody molecular marker complex. After washing off the unbound reagent the remaining tertiary complex is then exposed to the light of the appropriate wavelength the fluorescence observed indicates the presence of the molecular marker of interest. Immunofluorescence and EIA techniques are both very well established in the art. However other reporter molecules such as radioisotope chemiluminescent or bioluminescent molecules may also be employed.

As noted above embodiments of the invention can use antibodies that bind to a protein fragment of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 but not the complete protein e.g. antibodies that bind to epitope produced by the cleavage of the full length protein . Such embodiments can be used to examine protein fragments in a cell by immunohistochemical staining techniques. In such techniques a tissue sample may be fixed i.e. preserved by conventional methodology See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology 3edition 1960 Lee G. Luna H T ASCP Editor The Blakston Division McGraw Hill Book Company New York 1994 Ulreka V. Mikel Editor Armed Forces Institute of Pathology American Registry of Pathology Washington D.C. . One of skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of a fixative is determined by the purpose for which the tissue is to be histologically stained or otherwise analyzed. One of skill in the art will also appreciate that the length of fixation depends upon the size of the tissue sample and the fixative used. By way of example neutral buffered formalin Bouin s or paraformaldehyde may be used to fix a tissue sample. Subsequent to tissue preparation a tissue section may be subjected to one of the variety of immunohistochemical techniques known in the art.

A variety of materials can be used in the practice of the invention including any one of a wide variety of apoptosis inducing agents as well as antibodies that bind the protein fragments disclosed herein that are generated during apoptotic cell death. Exemplary apoptosis inducing agents include Apo2L anti DR4 or DR5 agonist antibodies FasL and anti Fas agonist antibodies. The Apo 2L which can be employed in the methods includes the Apo 2L polypeptides described in Pitti et al. supra WO 97 25428 supra and WO97 01633 supra the polypeptides referred to as TRAIL . It is contemplated that various forms of Apo 2L may be used such as the full length polypeptide as well as soluble forms of Apo 2L which comprise an extracellular domain ECD sequence. Examples of such soluble ECD sequences include polypeptides comprising amino acids 114 281 95 281 91 281 or 92 281 of the Apo 2L sequence shown in of Pitti et al. 271 12687 12690 1996 . It is presently believed that the polypeptide comprising amino acids 92 281 is a naturally cleaved form of Apo 2L. Applicants have expressed human Apo 2L in CHO cells and found that the 92 281 polypeptide is the expressed form of Apo 2L. Modified forms of Apo 2L such as the covalently modified forms described in WO 97 25428 are included. In particular Apo 2L linked to a non proteinaceous polymer such as polyethylene glycol is included for use in the present methods. The Apo 2L polypeptide can be made according to any of the methods described in WO 97 25428.

Variants of Apo 2 ligand having apoptotic activity which can be used in the methods include for example those identified by alanine scanning techniques. Particular substitutional variants comprise amino acids 91 281 of of Pitti et al. 271 12687 12690 1996 in which at least one of the amino acids at positions 203 218 or 269 are substituted by an alanine residue. Optionally the Apo 2 ligand variants may include one or more of these three different site substitutions.

It is contemplated that a molecule which mimics the apoptotic activity of Apo 2L and or FasL may alternatively be employed in the presently disclosed methods. Examples of such molecules include agonistic antibodies which can induce apoptosis in at least a comparable or like manner to Apo 2L. In particular these agonist antibodies would comprise antibodies to one or more of the receptors for Apo 2L. Preferably the agonist antibody is directed to an Apo 2L receptor which includes a cytoplasmic death domain such as DR4 or DR5. Even more preferably the agonist antibody binds to such a receptor and binding can be determined e.g. using FACS analysis or ELISA. Agonist antibodies directed to the receptor called DR5 or Apo 2 have been prepared using fusion techniques such as described below. One of the DR5 or Apo 2 receptor agonist antibodies is referred to as 3F11.39.7 and has been deposited with ATCC as deposit no. HB 12456 on Jan. 13 1998. Agonist activity of the Apo 2L receptor antibodies can be determined using various methods for assaying for apoptotic activity and optionally apoptotic activity of such antibody can be determined by assaying the antibody alone or in a cross linked form using Fc immunoglobulin or complement.

Additionally agonist antibodies directed to another Apo 2L receptor called DR4 have also been prepared. An exemplary DR4 agonist antibodies is referred to as 4H6.17.8 and was deposited with ATCC as deposit no. HB 12455 on Jan. 13 1998. Agonist activity of the Apo 2L receptor antibodies can be determined using various methods for assaying for apoptotic activity and optionally apoptotic activity of such antibody can be determined by assaying the antibody alone or in a cross linked form using Fc immunoglobulin or complement.

Agonist antibodies contemplated by the invention include antibodies which bind a single Apo 2L receptor or more than one Apo 2L receptor. An antibody which binds more than one Apo 2L receptor can be characterized as an antibody that cross reacts with two or more different antigens and capable of binding to each of the different antigens e.g. as determined by ELISA or FACS as in the examples below. Optionally an antibody which specifically cross reacts with two or more different antigens is one which binds to a first antigen and further binds to a second different antigen wherein the binding ability of the antibody for the second antigen at an antibody concentration of about 10 g mL is from about 50 to about 100 preferably from about 75 to about 100 of the binding ability of the first antigen as determined in a capture ELISA such as in the examples below . For example the antibody may bind specifically to DR5 the first antigen and specifically cross react with another Apo 2L receptor such as DR4 the second antigen wherein the extent of binding of about 10 g mL of the antibody to DR4 is about 50 to about 100 of the binding ability of the antibody for DR5 in the capture ELISA herein. Various cross reactive antibodies to Apo 2L receptors are described in further detail in International Patent application number PCT US99 13197.

As described below exemplary forms of antibodies useful in the practice of embodiments of the invention include polyclonal monoclonal humanized bispecific and heteroconjugate antibodies.

The antibodies used in the practice of the invention may comprise polyclonal antibodies. Methods of preparing polyclonal antibodies are known to the skilled artisan. Polyclonal antibodies can be raised in a mammal for example by one or more injections of an immunizing agent and if desired an adjuvant. Typically the immunizing agent and or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections. The immunizing agent may include for example a complete or partial AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 polypeptide or a fusion protein thereof. It may be useful to conjugate the immunizing agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized. Examples of such immunogenic proteins include but are not limited to keyhole limpet hemocyanin serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Examples of adjuvants which may be employed include Freund s complete adjuvant and MPL TDM adjuvant monophosphoryl Lipid A synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate . The immunization protocol may be selected by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation. The mammal can then be bled and the serum assayed for antibody titer. If desired the mammal can be boosted until the antibody titer increases or plateaus.

The antibodies used in the practice of the invention may alternatively be monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared using hybridoma methods such as those described by Kohler and Milstein 256 495 1975 . In a hybridoma method a mouse hamster or other appropriate host animal is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.

Generally either peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs are used if cells of human origin are desired or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding Academic Press 1986 pp. 59 103 . Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells particularly myeloma cells of rodent bovine and human origin. Usually rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells may be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused immortalized cells. For example if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines which can be obtained for instance from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. An example of such a murine myeloma cell line is P3X63AgU.1. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 pp. 51 63 .

The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the desired immunogen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA . Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard 107 220 1980 .

After the desired hybridoma cells are identified the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding supra . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium or RPMI 1640 medium. Alternatively the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies used in the practice of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as simian COS cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also may be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Morrison et al. supra or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody. Optionally chimeric antibodies can be constructed which include at least one variable or hypervariable domain of an antibody such as one of the antibodies disclosed herein.

Optionally the antibodies of the present invention will bind to the same epitope s as any of the antibodies disclosed herein. This can be determined by conducting various assays such as described herein. For instance to determine whether a monoclonal antibody has the same specificity as the antibodies specifically referred to herein one can compare its activity in apoptosis assays.

The antibodies used in the practice of the invention include cross linked antibodies. The term cross linked as used herein refers to binding of at least two IgG molecules together to form one or single molecule. The antibodies may be cross linked using various linker molecules. Optionally the antibodies are cross linked using an anti IgG molecule complement chemical modification or molecular engineering. It is appreciated by those skilled in the art that complement has a relatively high affinity to antibody molecules once the antibodies bind to cell surface membrane. Accordingly it is believed that complement may be used as a cross linking molecule to link two or more antibodies bound to cell surface membrane. Among the various murine Ig isotypes IgM IgG2a and IgG2b are known to fix complement.

The antibodies used in the practice of the invention may optionally comprise dimeric antibodies as well as multivalent forms of antibodies. Those skilled in the art may construct such dimers or multivalent forms by techniques known in the art and using the anti Apo 2L receptor antibodies herein.

The antibodies used in the practice of the invention may also comprise monovalent antibodies. Methods for preparing monovalent antibodies are well known in the art. For example one method involves recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light chain and modified heavy chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy chain crosslinking. Alternatively the relevant cysteine residues are substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to prevent crosslinking.

In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof particularly Fab fragments can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art. For instance digestion can be performed using papain. Examples of papain digestion are described in WO 94 29348 published Dec. 22 1994 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 342 566. Papain digestion of antibodies typically produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

The Fab fragments produced in the antibody digestion also contain the constant domains of the light chain and the first constant domain CH of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CHdomain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

Single chain Fv fragments may also be produced such as described in Iliades et al. 409 437 441 1997 . Coupling of such single chain fragments using various linkers is described in Kortt et al. 10 423 433 1997 .

In addition to the antibodies described above it is contemplated that chimeric or hybrid antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry including those involving crosslinking agents. For example immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl 4 mercaptobutyrimidate.

Antibodies used in the practice of the invention may further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof such as Fv Fab Fab F ab or other antigen binding subsequences of antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a complementary determining region CDR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat or rabbit having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

Methods for humanizing non human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important in order to reduce antigenicity. According to the best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework FR for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 151 2296 2308 1993 Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 89 4285 4289 1992 Presta et al. 151 2623 2632 1993 .

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to a preferred method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequence so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding see WO 94 04679 published 3 Mar. 1994 .

Human monoclonal antibodies may be made via an adaptation of the hybridoma method first described by Kohler and Milstein by using human B lymphocytes as the fusion partner. Human B lymphocytes producing an antibody of interest may for example be isolated from a human individual after obtaining informed consent. For instance the individual may be producing antibodies against an autoantigen as occurs with certain disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus Shoenfeld et al. 70 205 1982 immune mediated thrombocytopenic purpura ITP Nugent et al. 70 1 16 22 1987 or cancer. Alternatively or additionally lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. For instance one may expose isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro to a lysomotrophic agent e.g. L leucine O methyl ester L glutamic acid dimethly ester or L leucyl L leucine O methyl ester U.S. Pat. No. 5 567 610 Borrebaeck et al. and or T cell depleted human peripheral blood lymphocytes may be treated in vitro with adjuvants such as 8 mercaptoguanosine and cytokines U.S. Pat. No. 5 229 275 Goroff et al. .

The B lymphocytes recovered from the subject or immunized in vitro are then generally immortalized in order to generate a human monoclonal antibody. Techniques for immortalizing the B lymphocyte include but are not limited to a fusion of the human B lymphocyte with human murine myelomas or mouse human heteromyeloma cells b viral transformation e.g. with an Epstein Barr virus see Nugent et al. supra for example c fusion with a lymphoblastoid cell line or d fusion with lymphoma cells.

Lymphocytes may be fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells. Suitable human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines have been described Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 . Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA .

After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

Human antibodies may also be generated using a non human host such as a mouse which is capable of producing human antibodies. As noted above transgenic mice are now available that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region J gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 591 669 5 589 369 and 5 545 807. Human antibodies may also be prepared using SCID hu mice Duchosal et al. 355 258 262 1992 .

In another embodiment the human antibody may be selected from a human antibody phage display library. The preparation of libraries of antibodies or fragments thereof is well known in the art and any of the known methods may be used to construct a family of transformation vectors which may be introduced into host cells. Libraries of antibody light and heavy chains in phage Huse et al. 246 1275 1989 or of fusion proteins in phage or phagemid can be prepared according to known procedures. See for example Vaughan et al. 14 309 314 1996 Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 Barbas et al. 89 4457 4461 1992 Griffiths et al. 13 3245 3260 1994 de Kruif et al. 248 97 105 1995 WO 98 05344 WO 98 15833 WO 97 47314 WO 97 44491 WO 97 35196 WO 95 34648 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 089 5 702 892 5 427 908 5 403 484 5 432 018 5 270 170 WO 92 06176 WO 99 06587 U.S. Pat. No. 5 514 548 WO97 08320 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 702 892. The antigen of interest is panned against the phage library using procedures known in the field for selecting phage antibodies which bind to the target antigen.

The antibodies as described herein will optionally possess one or more desired biological activities or properties. Such antibodies may include but are not limited to chimeric humanized human and affinity matured antibodies. As described above the antibodies may be constructed or engineered using various techniques to achieve these desired activities or properties. In one embodiment the antibody will have a binding affinity of at least 10M preferably at least in the range of 10Mto 10M more preferably at least in the range of 10Mto 10Mand even more preferably at least in the range of 10Mto 10M. The binding affinity of the antibody can be determined without undue experimentation by testing the antibody in accordance with techniques known in the art including Scatchard analysis see Munson et al. supra .

In another embodiment the antibody of the invention may bind the same epitope to which the antibodies disclosed herein bind or bind an epitope which coincides or overlaps with the epitope to which the antibodies disclosed herein bind. The epitope binding property of the antibody of the present invention may be determined using techniques known in the art. For instance the antibody may be tested in an in vitro assay such as a competitive inhibition assay to determine the ability of the antibody to block or inhibit a known binding interaction.

Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal preferably human or humanized antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two heavy chains have different specificities Milstein and Cuello 305 537 539 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 published 13 May 1993 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

Antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites can be fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 EP 03089 . It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry including those involving crosslinking agents. For example immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl 4 mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980.

Triabodies are also within the scope of the invention. Such antibodies are described for instance in Iliades et al. supra and Kortt et al. supra.

Other modifications of antibodies are contemplated herein. Certain antibodies useful in methods of the present invention may be modified by conjugating the antibody to a cytotoxic agent like a toxin molecule or a prodrug activating enzyme which converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent see WO81 01145 to an active anti cancer drug. See for example WO 88 07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278. This technology is also referred to as Antibody Dependent Enzyme Mediated Prodrug Therapy ADEPT .

The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active cytotoxic form. Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate containing prodrugs into free drugs arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate containing prodrugs into free drugs cytosine deaminase useful for converting non toxic 5 fluorocytosine into the anti cancer drug 5 fluorouracil proteases such as serratia protease thermolysin subtilisin carboxypeptidases and cathepsins such as cathepsins B and L that are useful for converting peptide containing prodrugs into free drugs caspases such as caspase 3 D alanylcarboxypeptidases useful for converting prodrugs that contain D amino acid substituents carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as beta galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs beta lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with beta lactams into free drugs and penicillin amidases such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups respectively into free drugs. Alternatively antibodies with enzymatic activity also known in the art as abzymes can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs see e.g. Massey 328 457 458 1987 . Antibody abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population.

The enzymes can be covalently bound to the antibodies by techniques well known in the art such as the use of heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents. Alternatively fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art see e.g. Neuberger et al. 312 604 608 1984 .

As is known in the art antibodies such as those used in immunoassays to detect a protein fragment of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 can be conjugated to a variety of imaging agents. Conjugation may be accomplished directly between the antibody and the imaging agent or linking or intermediate molecular groups may be provided between the antibody and the active agent. Crosslinkers often used facilitate conjugation by providing attachment sites for each moiety. Crosslinkers may include additional molecular groups which serve as spacers to separate the moieties from each other to prevent either from interfering with the activity of the other.

Imaging can be performed by many procedures well known to those having ordinary skill in the art and the appropriate imaging agent useful in such procedures may be conjugated to an antibody by well known means. Imaging can be performed for example by visualizing the results of a Western procedure by radioscintigraphy nuclear magnetic resonance imaging MRI or computed tomography CT scan . Commonly employed radionuclide imaging agents include radioactive iodine and indium. Imaging by CT scan may employ a heavy metal such as iron chelates. MRI scanning may employ chelates of gadolinium or manganese. Additionally positron emission tomography PET is possible using positron emitters of oxygen nitrogen iron carbon or gallium. Examples of radionuclides useful in imaging procedures include K Fe Co Cu Ga Ga Br Rb In In I I Cs Cs I I Hg Pb and Bi.

Magerstadt M. 1991 Antibody Conjugates And Malignant Disease CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. and Barchel S. W. and Rhodes B. H. 1983 Radioimaging and Radiotherapy Elsevier NY N.Y. each of which is incorporated herein by reference teach the conjugation of various therapeutic and diagnostic radionuclides to amino acids of antibodies. Such reactions may be applied to conjugate radionuclides to antibodies with an appropriate linker. Suitable labels include for example radionuclides enzymes e.g. horse radish peroxidase substrates cofactors inhibitors fluorescers chemiluminescers and or magnetic particles. See for examples of patents teaching the use of such labels U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 817 837 3 850 752 3 939 350 3 996 345 4 277 437 4 275 149 and 4 366 241 all of which are incorporated by reference.

Further antibody modifications are also contemplated. For example the antibody may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers e.g. polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylenes or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. The antibody also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Oslo A. Ed. 1980 . To increase the serum half life of the antibody one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody especially an antibody fragment as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 739 277 for example. As used herein the term salvage receptor binding epitope refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule e.g. IgG IgG IgG or IgG that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half life of the IgG molecule.

The invention also provides isolated nucleic acids encoding a polypeptide of interest for example the proteins protein fragments e.g. protein fragment of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 and or antibodies as disclosed herein vectors and host cells comprising the nucleic acid and recombinant techniques for the production of a polypeptide of interest.

For recombinant production of the polypeptide of interest the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the polypeptide of interest . Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of the following a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence.

The methods herein include methods for the production of chimeric or recombinant antibodies which bind a protein fragment of AP2 SEQ ID NO 1 clathrin heavy chain SEQ ID NO 2 AP1 2 SEQ ID NO 3 or dynamin SEQ ID NO 4 and which comprise the steps of providing a vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the antibody light chain or heavy chain or both a light chain and a heavy chain transfecting or transforming a host cell with the vector and culturing the host cell s under conditions sufficient to produce the recombinant product.

An polypeptide of interest may be produced recombinantly not only directly but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process a native signal sequence the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase lpp or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by e.g. the yeast invertase leader factor leader including and factor leaders or acid phosphatase leader the glucoamylase leader or the signal described in WO 90 13646. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders for example the herpes simplex gD signal are available.

The DNA for such precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest.

Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria yeast and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram negative bacteria the 2 plasmid origin is suitable for yeast and various viral origins SV40 polyoma adenovirus VSV or BPV are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter .

Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media e.g. the gene encoding D alanine racemase for

One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.

Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the nucleic acid such as DHFR thymidine kinase metallothionein I and II preferably primate metallothionein genes adenosine deaminase ornithine decarboxylase etc.

For example cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate Mtx a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity.

Alternatively host cells particularly wild type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR transformed or co transformed with DNA sequences encoding the polypeptide of interest wild type DHFR protein and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3 phosphotransferase APH can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic e.g. kanamycin neomycin or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 965 199.

A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 Stinchcomb et al. 282 39 1979 . The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4 1. Jones 85 12 1977 . The presence of the trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly Leu2 deficient yeast strains ATCC 20 622 or 38 626 are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.

In addition vectors derived from the 1.6 m circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for transformation of yeasts. Alternatively an expression system for large scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for . Van den Berg 8 135 1990 . Stable multi copy expression vectors for secretion of mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of have also been disclosed. Fleer et al. 9 968 975 1991 .

Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the nucleic acid. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter lactamase and lactose promoter systems alkaline phosphatase a tryptophan trp promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine Dalgarno S.D. sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest.

Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3 end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3 end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.

Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes such as enolase glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase hexokinase pyruvate decarboxylase phospho fructokinase glucose 6 phosphate isomerase 3 phosphoglycerate mutase pyruvate kinase triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucose isomerase and glucokinase.

Other yeast promoters which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2 isocytochrome C acid phosphatase degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism metallothionein glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73 657. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.

Transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 SV40 from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 419 446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 601 978. See also Reyes et al. 297 598 601 1982 on expression of human interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.

Transcription of a DNA encoding a polypeptide of interest by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv 297 17 18 1982 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the coding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells yeast fungi insect plant animal human or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding a multivalent antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94 11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the prokaryote yeast or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms for example Enterobacteriaceae such as e.g. e.g. e.g. and as well as such as and e.g. 41P disclosed in DD 266 710 published 12 April 1989 such as and . One preferred cloning host is 294 ATCC 31 446 although other strains such as B X1776 ATCC 31 537 and W3110 ATCC 27 325 are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.

In addition to prokaryotes eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for vectors. or common baker s yeast is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However a number of other genera species and strains are commonly available and useful herein such as hosts such as e.g. ATCC 12 424 ATCC 16 045 ATCC 24 178 ATCC 56 500 ATCC 36 906 and EP 402 226 EP 183 070 EP 244 234 such as and filamentous fungi such as e.g. and hosts such as and

Suitable host cells for the expression of polypeptides of interest are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as caterpillar mosquito mosquito fruitfly and have been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available e.g. the L 1 variant of NPV and the Bm 5 strain of NPV and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention particularly for transfection of cells.

Plant cell cultures of cotton corn potato soybean petunia tomato and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.

However interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK ATCC CCL 10 Chinese hamster ovary cells DHFR CHO Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 ATCC CCL 70 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 ATCC CRL 1587 human cervical carcinoma cells HELA ATCC CCL 2 canine kidney cells MDCK ATCC CCL 34 buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A ATCC CRL 1442 human lung cells W138 ATCC CCL 75 human liver cells Hep G2 HB 8065 mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 ATCC CCL51 TRI cells Mather et al. 383 44 68 1982 MRC 5 cells FS4 cells a human hepatoma line Hep G2 and myeloma or lymphoma cells e.g. Y0 J558L P3 and NS0 cells see U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 715 .

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for production of the polypeptide of interest and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The host cells used to produce the polypeptide of interest may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Pat. No. Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

When using recombinant techniques the polypeptide of interest can be produced intracellularly in the periplasmic space or directly secreted into the medium. If the polypeptide of interest is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments is removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of . Briefly cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate pH 3.5 EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride PMSF over about 30 minutes. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the polypeptide of interest is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc region that is present in antibodies. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the polypeptide of interest to be recovered.

In another embodiment of the invention an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the practice of embodiments of the methods described above are provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label. Suitable containers include for example bottles vials syringes and test tubes. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic.

Preferably both the enzyme and the substrate are provided in the kit. The kit may also include an uncoated support onto which a sample to be assayed or the first antibody can be immobilized.

IV. USING METHODS AND MATERIALS OF THE INVENTION TO EXAMINE CELLULAR PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH APOPTOSIS

The methods and materials of the invention can be used to examine a wide variety of cellular processes such as endocytosis. Certain embodiments of the invention for example observe changes in the rate of cellular endocytosis as an indicator of apoptosis with an inhibition in endocytosis providing evidence of apoptosis. Endocytosis is crucial for various aspects of cell homeostasis. Endocytosis internalizes plasma membrane PM associated proteins through membrane bound vesicles supporting various cellular functions including nutrient uptake growth factor signaling and membrane homeostasis see e.g. Conner S. D. et. al. 422 37 44 2003 . One of the best characterized endocytosis pathways relies on the protein clathrin see e.g. Bonifacino J. S. et. al. 72 395 447 2003 . Clathrin adaptors such as adaptor protein 2 AP2 link clathrin to cytoplasmic determinants of endocytic cargo during the formation of PM invaginations known as clathrin coated pits. Adaptors also perform scaffolding functions in endocytosis by recruiting accessory or regulatory proteins see e.g. Owen D. J. et. al P. R. 20 153 91 2004 . GTP hydrolysis by dynamin drives the scission of deeply invaginated coated pits to release endocytic transport vesicles from the PM. After uncoating the vesicles dock and fuse with early endosomes where cargo sorts to different fates e.g. tubulo vesicular endosomal membranes for recycling to the PM or internal membranes of multivesicular late endosomes for lysosomal degradation.

Using methods and materials of the invention it is shown that pro apoptotic death receptors DRs trigger selective destruction of the clathrin dependent endocytosis machinery. DR stimulation induced rapid caspase mediated cleavage of key clathrin pathway components halting cellular uptake of the classic cargo protein transferrin. DR proximal initiator caspases cleaved the clathrin adaptor subunit AP2 between functionally distinct domains while effector caspases processed clathrin s heavy chain. DR5 is shown to undergo ligand induced clathrin mediated endocytosis providing evidence that internalization of DR signaling complexes facilitates clathrin pathway targeting by caspases. An endocytosis blocking temperature sensitive dynamin 1 mutant attenuated DR internalization enhanced caspase stimulation downstream of DRs and increased apoptosis. Thus DR triggered caspase activity disrupts clathrin dependent endocytosis leading to amplification of programmed cell death.

In studies on DR5 endocytosis it was observed that the DR5 ligand Apo2L TRAIL triggered proteolytic cleavage of the subunit of AP2 AP2 . Analysis of several cancer cell lines showed that Apo2L TRAIL promoted not only the expected processing of caspase 8 and 3 but also cleavage of AP2 AP1 2 and clathrin heavy chain CHC . These events occurred within 2 hr and were restricted to cell lines susceptible to Apo2L TRAIL induced apoptosis such as Colo205 BJAB and HeLa M compared to resistant cell lines such as HCT8 . Additional cell lines confirmed this observation . FasL stimulated cleavage of AP2 and CHC in BJAB cells comparably to Apo2L TRAIL . Apo2L TRAIL also induced cleavage of dynamin leading to depletion of the full length protein that started within 1 hr of stimulation . In a similar timeframe Apo2L TRAIL did not induce proteolysis of structurally analogous adaptors that mediate other types of clathrin dependent vesicular transport events . These included AP1 AP3 and and AP4 which support transport between the trans Golgi network and endosomes and the COP I subunit COP or the COP II subunit Sec23 which mediate transport between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi see e.g. Bonifacino J. S. et. al. 72 395 447 2003 and McMahon H. T. et. al. 16 379 91 2004 . Hence DR activation promotes rapid and specific cleavage of proteins involved in clathrin dependent endocytosis.

Pretreatment with the pan caspase inhibitor N benzyloxycarbonyl Val Ala Asp fluoromethylketone zVAD fmk at a dose that inhibited ligand induced processing of caspase 8 and 3 prevented cleavage of AP2 and CHC as well as of AP2 in BJAB cells indicating a requirement for caspase activity. Furthermore while Apo2L TRAIL and FasL induced cleavage of AP2 and CHC in wt Jurkat T cells neither ligand stimulated processing of these targets in caspase 8 deficient or FADD deficient mutant Jurkat cell lines . AP2 cleavage was fast and correlated in time with caspase 8 processing while it preceded caspase 3 processing . By contrast CHC cleavage was relatively slower and correlated better in timing with caspase 3 processing. In HCT116 cells caspase 3 activation and apoptosis induction by Apo2L TRAIL require Bax while caspase 8 stimulation does not see e.g. LeBlanc H. N. et. al. 10 66 75 2003 . As expected Apo2L TRAIL stimulated processing of both caspase 8 and 3 in Bax HCT116 cells but only of caspase 8 in Bax HCT116 cells . AP2 cleavage was independent of Bax whereas CHC cleavage required Bax . In MCF7 cells which are deficient in caspase 3 Apo2L TRAIL induced relatively weak and slow processing of caspase 8 and AP2 but did not stimulate CHC cleavage see e.g. Kischkel F. C. et al. 12 611 20 2000 . Furthermore siRNA knockdown of caspase 3 in HT1080 cells blocked ligand induced processing of CHC but not of AP2 . These findings provide evidence that initiator caspases in the DR pathway cleave AP2 while effector caspases process CHC.

AP2 contains two major functional parts linked by a hinge region the C terminal ear and N terminal trunk domains see e.g. Owen D. J. et. al P. R. 20 153 91 2004 . To define the primary site of AP2 cleavage the C terminal 33 kDa cleavage product was immunopurified from BJAB cells and the identity of its tryptic peptides by mass spectrometry was confirmed . N terminal sequencing revealed GPAAQPSLGPTPEEAFLS residues 688 to 705 of SEQ ID NO 1 a sequence immediately upstream from DVFD residues 684 to 687 of SEQ ID NO 1 a tetrapeptide sequence that resembles well characterized caspase recognition sites see e.g. Stennicke H. R. et. al 350 Pt 2 563 8 2000 . The cleavage site has Asp and Gly at respective P1 and P1 positions flanking the scissile bond and an Asp at the P4 position which caspase 8 tolerates well see e.g. Blanchard H. et al. 302 9 16 2000 . While this tetrapeptide cleavage site sequence is present in isoform A of AP2 it is absent in isoform C. Consistent with this difference Apo2L TRAIL did not induce cleavage of isoform C which was much less abundant than isoform A in BJAB Colo205 LS1034 and SW948 cells. This AP2 cleavage site resides within the hinge providing evidence that its hydrolysis may disrupt AP2 function. Longer ligand stimulation of certain cell lines led to further processing of AP2 at a secondary site which appeared to be within the initial 33 kDa fragment and .

To assess the functional consequence of these caspase mediated cleavage events the uptake of transferrin Tf was studied. Internalization of receptor bound Tf occurs via clathrin coated pits and strictly requires AP2 see e.g. Bonifacino J. S. et. al. 72 395 447 2003 . To determine the endocytosis rate of fluorescent labeled Tf the measurements were confined to the initial linear phase of uptake before internalized protein undergoes endocytic recycling to the PM inset . Apo2L TRAIL inhibited the rate of Tf endocytosis in BJAB and Colo205 cells by 75 85 pretreatment with zVAD fmk substantially reversed this inhibition . Hence DR activation leads to caspase dependent disruption of clathrin mediated endocytosis.

The rapid and selective cleavage of clathrin pathway components provided evidence that physical proximity of DRs to clathrin coat proteins might facilitate the proteolytic events. Therefore it was asked whether DR5 undergoes clathrin mediated endocytosis upon ligand stimulation. A monoclonal antibody mAb 5C7 was used that recognizes the receptor s extracellular domain without competing for ligand binding see e.g. Kischkel F. C. et al. 12 611 20 2000 . Incubation with saturating amounts of 5C7 at 37 C. did not affect surface DR5 levels as detected by another non overlapping mAb verifying that 5C7 itself does not alter DR5 endocytosis. A fluorescent conjugate of mAb 5C7 5C7 was prepared bound to Colo205 cells at 0 C. and followed to measure the kinetics of DR5 endocytosis at 37 C. . Exposure to trimeric or multimeric antibody crosslinked forms of Apo2L TRAIL similarly accelerated the rate of DR5 endocytosis by 2 fold leading to of the receptor internalizing over 2 hr mostly within the initial 30 min . Correspondingly cell surface DR5 declined during the first 30 min of stimulation after which this DR5 pool stabilized . Similar results were observed in BJAB cells. In contrast to data obtained upon brief exposure to ligand at 37 C. extended exposure for 2 hr inhibited DR5 endocytosis concomitantly with that of Tf reducing the rate by 2.5 or 5 fold respectively . These results provide evidence that the clathrin pathway supports the endocytosis of DR5. Indeed in Colo205 cells briefly treated with Apo2L TRAIL a small fraction of the cell surface 5C7 localized to clathrin coated pits by electron microscopy EM with no detectable localization to non coated surface invaginations or caveolae .

Next an established intervention strategy was used that was based on doxycycline regulated expression of a temperature sensitive mutant of the GTPase dynamin 1 dyn in retrovirus infected cells. This mutant rapidly and reversibly inhibits clathrin dependent endocytosis upon shifting from a permissive 30 C. to a nonpermissive 38 C. temperature see e.g. Damke H. et al. 131 69 80 1995 . Initial experiments in HeLa M cells confirmed that doxycyline induction blocked Tf uptake at 38 C. in cells with dynexpression but not in neighboring non expressing cells nor at 30 C. and . While inducible expression of dynin HeLa M or Colo205 cells was not sufficiently stable it was stable in a transduced BJAB cell line with a strong block in Tf uptake at 38 C. . Doxycyclin stimulated expression of dynalso decreased ligand induced DR5 uptake from 25 at 30 C. to 10 at 38 C. By contrast endocytosis was similar at both temperatures in absence of doxycylin . In HeLa M cells dyninduction followed by a shift to 38 C. also attenuated ligand induced DR5 uptake this effect was weaker than in BJAB cells probably because of diminished dynexpression . To exclude the unlikely possibility that decreased DR5 uptake in these 20 min uptake experiments was attributed to increased endocytic recycling rather than reduced endocytosis rates best measured over a 4 min uptake interval a dominant negative dynamin mutant dynamin 1 that unconditionally blocks clathrin dependent endocytosis was used see e.g. Damke H. et al. 127 915 34 1994 . Dynamin 1inhibited both Tf and ligand induced DR5 endocytosis in HeLa M cells .

Together with the EM data these results indicate that Apo2L TRAIL induced DR5 uptake occurs primarily through clathrin dependent endocytosis. Thus physical proximity of the DISC within coated pits to clathrin coat components may facilitate their cleavage. If true DISC assembly and initiator caspase activation should not require actual internalization of the coated pits. To test this BJAB cells were chilled on ice to block Tf endocytosis . Despite the block Apo2L TRAIL and FasL still recruited FADD and caspase 8 to their respective receptors and processed caspase 8 . Furthermore Apo2L TRAIL induced comparable DISC formation caspase 8 processing and caspase 8 activity in the DISC at 38 C. despite endocytosis inhibition by dyn and .

The rapid cleavage of clathrin pathway proteins provides evidence that disruption of endocytosis might promote ligand induced caspase activation and apoptosis. Indeed dyn mediated blockade of endocytosis markedly augmented ligand induced processing of the total cellular caspase 8 pool Bid AP2 and effector caspases 3 and 7 from whole cell lysates without significantly altering formation or activation of the DISC itself and . Quantitative analysis showed a substantial increase in ligand stimulated caspase 3 7 enzymatic activity after induction of dynand temperature shift to 38 C. as compared to 30 C. . Moreover this condition also resulted in augmented apoptosis an effect observed after stimulation with either the wt ligand or a DR5 selective variant see e.g. Kelley R. F. et al. 280 2205 12 2005 . Sensitization was evident not only by a left shift of the dosage response curve but also by greater maximal percentage of cells with fragmented DNA . These results indicate that caspase mediated disruption of clathrin dependent endocytosis amplifies caspase activation downstream of the DISC leading to stronger apoptosis stimulation.

As described above using methods and materials of the invention an unexpected interaction between the cell extrinsic apoptosis pathway and the clathrin dependent endocytosis machinery was uncovered. Within minutes of pro apoptotic DR engagement activated caspases begin to cleave proteins that mediate clathrin dependent endocytosis. The relatively rapid kinetics of AP2 cleavage the requirement of this event for FADD and caspase 8 and the independence from Bax and caspase 3 provide evidence that DR proximal caspases most likely caspase 8 and or caspase 10 carry out the initial processing of AP2 . Indeed the caspase cleavage site in the AP2 hinge fits with sequences that caspase 8 is capable of recognizing see e.g. Nicholson D. W. 6 1028 42 1999 .

The inhibition of clathrin dependent endocytosis by DR activation occurred in the same timeframe as caspase stimulation and was reversed by zVAD fmk demonstrating its dependence on caspase activity. The primary AP2 processing site mapped to the hinge region. The hinge links the ear domain which supports accessory protein recruitment to the trunk domain which mediates PM association and cargo binding in conjunction with other AP2 subunits see e.g. Owen D. J. et. al P. R. 20 153 2004 . Overexpression of the AP2 ear domain in COST cells inhibits clathrin dependent endocytosis an effect abrogated by mutations that prevent accessory protein binding see e.g. Owen D. J. et al. 97 805 15 1999 . Conversely studies in Drosophila in which some cells express only earless AP2 provide evidence that the ear domain is not required in general endocytosis see e.g. Berdnik D. et al. 3 221 31 2002 . Thus it is unclear whether caspase cleavage of AP2 alone is sufficient to perturb endocytosis or whether the processing of other clathrin pathway components also contributes. Regardless DR mediated caspase activation rapidly disrupts clathrin dependent endocytosis.

In considering how activated caspases access clathrin coat substrates the data provides evidence that after Apo2L TRAIL stimulation a substantial portion of surface DR5 moves into the cell through clathrin dependent endocytosis. Preliminary EM studies confirm that DR5 associates with clathrin coated pits. Recent work indicates that RNAi mediated knockdown of clathrin and AP2 inhibits apoptotic signaling through Fas a result interpreted as revealing an endocytosis requirement for receptor signaling see e.g. Lee K. H. et al. 25 1009 23 2006 . In light of observations that Apo2L TRAIL DISC assembly activation and apoptosis can still occur when endocytosis is inhibited by incubation on ice or through dynamin inactivation it is surmised that DR5 can bind FADD and caspase 8 while still at the cell surface possibly within clathrin coated pita. Indeed blocking endocytosis with incubation on ice or temperature sensitive dynamin does not interfere with coated pit formation and cargo recruitment see e.g. Damke H. et al. 131 69 80 1995 . DR activation caused nearly complete destruction of AP2 . In contrast CHC and AP1 2 processing involved only a fraction of the total cellular proteins perhaps the fraction that participated directly in DR endocytosis. Thus caspase activation in the vicinity of the internalizing DR associated DISC may lead to local destruction of specific clathrin pathway components.

One straightforward implication of the finding that caspases disrupt clathrin mediated endocytosis is that the elimination of this mechanism may represent a previously unrecognized part of the apoptotic program a cell that is committed to apoptosis no longer needs to take up nutrients respond to growth factors or maintain membrane homeostasis. It is unlikely however that these cleavages on their own trigger apoptosis as both clathrin and AP2 have been efficiently knocked down using siRNAs by a number of different labs with none reporting an increase in apoptosis. Notably the cytotoxic DNA damaging drugs vinblastine and adriamycin also induced cleavage of components of the clathrin machinery albeit with much slower kinetics than DR ligands . On the other hand caspase mediated processing of clathrin adaptors may play a role also in non apoptotic cell modulation In immature dendritic cells basal caspase activity leads to cleavage of several adaptin subunits while zVAD inhibition of this effect promotes dendritic cell maturation see e.g. Santambrogio L. et al. 6 1020 8 2005 .

A second perhaps more surprising implication of the interplay between DRs and the clathrin endocytic machinery is that this interaction provides a positive feedback loop that reinforces caspase activation through the extrinsic pathway. According to this model endocytosis of activated DRs opposes apoptotic signaling to preserve cell survival if the clathrin machinery remains intact for instance in response to sub threshold ligand levels. However if DR stimulation generates enough caspase activity to disrupt endocytosis then the signal persists amplifying further caspase activation and promoting apoptosis. Conceivably DR endocytosis could oppose DR signaling through lysosomal degradation some other form of signal termination or induction of competing anti apoptotic signals. Endocytosis did not regulate caspase activation at the level of initial DISC association. Nonetheless dynamin inactivation enhanced the processing of total cellular caspase 8 and progressively of caspase 3 and 7 and led to stronger apoptosis activation providing evidence that endocytosis regulates further caspase activation downstream of the initial DISC.

In summary a bidirectional relationship between DR induced apoptosis and clathrin dependent endocytosis is disclosed herein DR activation leads to caspase mediated destruction of important components of the clathrin endocytic machinery thereby halting this process. Disruption of clathrin dependent endocytosis augments caspase activation downstream of DRs and increases apoptosis providing evidence of a positive feedback loop that amplifies caspase activation and apoptosis execution.
