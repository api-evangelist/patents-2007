B cells express a wide array of cell surface molecules during their differentiation and proliferation. Examples include the CD10 CD19 CD20 CD21 CD22 CD23 CD24 CD37 CD53 CD72 CD74 CD75 CD77 CD79a CD79b CD80 CD81 CD82 CD83 CD84 CD85 and CD86 leukocyte surface markers. These markers have been generally suggested as therapeutic targets for the treatment of B cell disorders or diseases such as B cell malignancies autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection. Antibodies that specifically bind them have been developed and some have been tested as therapeutic agent for the treatment of diseases and disorders.

For example chimeric or radiolabeled monoclonal antibody mAb based therapies directed against the CD20 cell surface molecule specific for mature B cells and their malignant counterparts have been shown to be an effective in vivo treatment for non Hodgkin s lymphoma Tedder et al.

Both cellular T cell mediated and humoral antibody B cell mediated immunity are now known to play significant roles in graft rejection. While the importance of T cell mediated immunity in graft rejection is well established the critical role of humoral immunity in acute and chronic rejection has only recently become evident. Consequently most of the advances in the treatment and prevention of graft rejection have developed from therapeutic agents that target T cell activation. The first therapeutic monoclonal antibody that was FDA approved for the treatment of graft rejection was the murine monoclonal antibody ORTHOCLONE OKT3 muromonab CD3 directed against the CD3 receptor of T cells. OKT3 has been joined by a number of other anti lymphocyte directed antibodies including the monoclonal anti CD52 CAMPATH antibodies CAMPATH 1G CAMPATH 1H alemtuzumab and CAMPATH 1M and polyclonal anti thymocyte antibody preparations referred to as anti thymocyte globulin or ATG also called thymoglobin or thymoglobulin . Other T cell antibodies approved for the prevention of transplant rejection include the chimeric monoclonal antibody SIMULECT basiliximab and the humanized monoclonal antibody ZENAPAX daclizumab both of which target the high affinity IL 2 receptor of activated T cells.

The importance of humoral immunity in graft rejection was initially thought to be limited to hyperacute rejection in which the graft recipient possesses anti donor HLA antibodies prior to transplantation resulting in rapid destruction of the graft in the absence of an effective therapeutic regimen of antibody suppression. Recently it has become evident that humoral immunity is also an important factor mediating both acute and chronic rejection. For example clinical observations demonstrated that graft survival in patients capable of developing class I or class II anti HLA alloantibodies also referred to as anti MHC alloantibodies was reduced compared to graft survival in patients that could not develop such antibodies. Clinical and experimental data also indicate that other donor specific alloantibodies and autoantibodies are critical mediators of rejection. For a current review of the evidence supporting a role for donor specific antibodies in allograft rejection see Rifle et al. Transplantation 79 S14 518 2005 . Thus due to the relatively recent appreciation of the role of humoral immunity in acute and chronic graft rejection current therapeutic agents and strategies for targeting humoral immunity are less well developed than those for targeting cellular immunity. Accordingly there is a need in the art for improved reagents and methods for treating and preventing graft rejection i.e. graft versus host disease GVHD humoral rejection and post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder in human transplant recipients.

Autoimmune diseases as a whole cause significant morbidity and disability. Based on incidence data collected from 1965 to 1995 it has been estimated that approximately 1.2 million persons will develop a new autoimmune disease over the next five years. Jacobsen et al. Clin Immunol. Immunopathol. 84 223 1997 evaluated over 130 published studies and estimated that in 1996 8.5 million people in the United States 3.2 of the population had at least one of the 24 autoimmune diseases examined in these studies. Considering the major impact of autoimmune diseases on public health effective and safe treatments are needed to address the burden of these disorders. Thus there is a need in the art for improved reagents and methods for treating autoimmune disease.

As used herein the terms antibody and antibodies immunoglobulins encompass monoclonal antibodies including full length monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies human antibodies humanized antibodies camelised antibodies chimeric antibodies single chain Fvs scFv single chain antibodies single domain antibodies domain antibodies Fab fragments F ab 2 fragments antibody fragments that exhibit the desired biological activity disulfide linked Fvs sdFv and anti idiotypic anti Id antibodies including e.g. anti Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention intrabodies and epitope binding fragments of any of the above. In particular antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules i.e. molecules that contain an antigen binding site. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD IgA and IgY class e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2 or subclass.

Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150 000 daltons composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain VH followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end VL and a constant domain at its other end the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Light chains are classified as either lambda chains or kappa chains based on the amino acid sequence of the light chain constant region. The variable domain of a kappa light chain may also be denoted herein as VK. The term variable region may also be used to describe the variable domain of a heavy chain or light chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains. Such antibodies may be derived from any mammal including but not limited to humans monkeys pigs horses rabbits dogs cats mice etc.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are responsible for the binding specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in segments called Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework regions FW . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FW regions largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FW regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are generally not involved directly in antigen binding but may influence antigen binding affinity and may exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in ADCC CDC and or apoptosis.

The term hypervariable region when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are associated with its binding to antigen. The hypervariable regions encompass the amino acid residues of the complementarity determining regions or CDRs e.g. residues 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 of the light chain variable domain and residues 31 35 H1 50 65 H2 and 95 102 H3 of the heavy chain variable domain Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 and or those residues from a hypervariable loop e.g. residues 26 32 L1 50 52 L2 and 91 96 L3 in the light chain variable domain and 26 32 H1 53 55 H2 and 96 101 H3 in the heavy chain variable domain Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 917 1987 . Framework or FW residues are those variable domain residues flanking the CDRs. FW residues are present in chimeric humanized human domain antibodies diabodies vaccibodies linear antibodies and bispecific antibodies.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to conventional polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they can be synthesized by hybridoma cells that are uncontaminated by other immunoglobulin producing cells. Alternative production methods are known to those trained in the art for example a monoclonal antibody may be produced by cells stably or transiently transfected with the heavy and light chain genes encoding the monoclonal antibody.

The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring engineering of the antibody by any particular method. The term monoclonal is used herein to refer to an antibody that is derived from a clonal population of cells including any eukaryotic prokaryotic or phage clone and not the method by which the antibody was engineered. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. Nature 256 495 1975 or may be made by any recombinant DNA method see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 including isolation from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. Nature 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597 1991 for example. These methods can be used to produce monoclonal mammalian chimeric humanized human domain antibodies diabodies vaccibodies linear antibodies and bispecific antibodies.

The term chimeric antibodies includes antibodies in which at least one portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass and at least one other portion of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Morrison et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a nonhuman primate e.g. Old World Monkey such as baboon rhesus or cynomolgus monkey and human constant region sequences U.S. Pat. No. 5 693 780 .

 Humanized forms of nonhuman e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from nonhuman immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which the native CDR residues are replaced by residues from the corresponding CDR of a nonhuman species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances FW region residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding nonhuman residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general a humanized antibody heavy or light chain will comprise substantially all of at least one or more variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDRs correspond to those of a nonhuman immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FWs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. In certain embodiments the humanized antibody will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 329 1988 and Presta Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 1992 .

A human antibody can be an antibody derived from a human or an antibody obtained from a transgenic organism that has been engineered to produce specific human antibodies in response to antigenic challenge and can be produced by any method known in the art. In certain techniques elements of the human heavy and light chain loci are introduced into strains of the organism derived from embryonic stem cell lines that contain targeted disruptions of the endogenous heavy chain and light chain loci. The transgenic organism can synthesize human antibodies specific for human antigens and the organism can be used to produce human antibody secreting hybridomas. A human antibody can also be an antibody wherein the heavy and light chains are encoded by a nucleotide sequence derived from one or more sources of human DNA. A fully human antibody also can be constructed by genetic or chromosomal transfection methods as well as phage display technology or in vitro activated B cells all of which are known in the art.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and ADCC refer to a cell mediated reaction in which non specific cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. In one embodiment such cells are human cells. While not wishing to be limited to any particular mechanism of action these cytotoxic cells that mediate ADCC generally express Fc receptors FcRs . The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII Fc RIII and or Fc RIV. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Ravetch and Kinet Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecules of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 652 656 1998 .

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the ability of a molecule to initiate complement activation and lyse a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to a molecule e.g. an antibody complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santaro et al. J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 1996 may be performed.

 Effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. The cells express at least Fc RI FC RII Fc RIII and or Fc RIV and carry out ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils.

The terms Fc receptor or FcR are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In one embodiment the FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover in certain embodiments the FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII Fc RIII and Fc RIV subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. See Da ron Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. Immunomethods 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. Immunol. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. J. Immunol. 24 249 1994 .

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent or covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer. Collectively the six CDRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

 Affinity of an antibody for an epitope to be used in the treatment s described herein is a term well understood in the art and means the extent or strength of binding of antibody to epitope. Affinity may be measured and or expressed in a number of ways known in the art including but not limited to equilibrium dissociation constant KD or Kd apparent equilibrium dissociation constant KD or Kd and IC50 amount needed to effect 50 inhibition in a competition assay . It is understood that for purposes of this invention an affinity is an average affinity for a given population of antibodies which bind to an epitope. Values of KD reported herein in terms of mg IgG per mL or mg mL indicate mg Ig per mL of serum although plasma can be used. When antibody affinity is used as a basis for administration of the treatment methods described herein or selection for the treatment methods described herein antibody affinity can be measured before and or during treatment and the values obtained can be used by a clinician in assessing whether a human patient is an appropriate candidate for treatment.

As used herein the term avidity is a measure of the overall binding strength i.e. both antibody arms with which an antibody binds an antigen. Antibody avidity can be determined by measuring the dissociation of the antigen antibody bond in antigen excess using any means known in the art such as but not limited to by the modification of indirect fluorescent antibody as described by Gray et al. J. Virol. Meth. 44 11 24. 1993 

An epitope is a term well understood in the art and means any chemical moiety that exhibits specific binding to an antibody. An antigen is a moiety or molecule that contains an epitope and as such also specifically binds to antibody.

A B cell surface marker as used herein is an antigen expressed on the surface of a B cell which can be targeted with an agent which binds thereto. B cell surface markers include the CD10 CD19 CD20 CD21 CD22 CD23 CD24 CD25 CD37 CD53 CD72 CD73 CD74 CD75 CD77 CD79a CD79b CD80 CD81 CD82 CD83 CD84 CD85 and CD86 leukocyte surface markers. A B cell surface marker of particular interest is preferentially expressed on B cells compared to other non B cell tissues of a mammal and may be expressed on both precursor B cells and mature B lineage cells. In one embodiment the marker is CD19 which is found on B cells at various stages of differentiation.

The term antibody half life as used herein means a pharmacokinetic property of an antibody that is a measure of the mean survival time of antibody molecules following their administration. Antibody half life can be expressed as the time required to eliminate 50 percent of a known quantity of immunoglobulin from the patient s body or a specific compartment thereof for example as measured in serum or plasma i.e. circulating half life or in other tissues. Half life may vary from one immunoglobulin or class of immunoglobulin to another. In general an increase in antibody half life results in an increase in mean residence time MRT in circulation for the antibody administered.

The term isotype refers to the classification of an antibody s heavy or light chain constant region. The constant domains of antibodies are not involved in binding to antigen but exhibit various effector functions. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain constant region a given human antibody or immunoglobulin can be assigned to one of five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM. Several of these classes may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG1 gamma 1 IgG2 gamma 2 IgG3 gamma 3 and IgG4 gamma 4 and IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy chain constant regions that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. The structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. Of the various human immunoglobulin classes only human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 and IgM are known to activate complement. Human IgG1 and IgG3 are known to mediate ADCC in humans. Human light chain constant regions may be classified into two major classes kappa and lambda

As used herein the term immunogenicity means that a compound is capable of provoking an immune response stimulating production of specific antibodies and or proliferation of specific T cells .

The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent or lower stringency hybridization conditions e.g. as defined herein to polynucleotides that encode a human humanized or chimeric antibody described herein that binds to hCD19.

Stringent hybridization conditions include but are not limited to hybridization to filter bound DNA in 6 sodium chloride sodium citrate SSC at about 45 C. followed by one or more washes in 0.2 SSC 0.1 SDS at about 50 65 C. highly stringent conditions such as hybridization to filter bound DNA in 6 SSC at about 45 C. followed by one or more washes in 0.1 SSC 0.2 SDS at about 60 C. or any other stringent hybridization conditions known to those skilled in the art see for example Ausubel F.

The polynucleotides may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined by any method known in the art. For example if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. BioTechniques 17 242 1994 which briefly involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

A polynucleotide encoding an antibody may also be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source e.g. an antibody cDNA library or a cDNA library generated from or nucleic acid preferably polyA RNA isolated from any tissue or cells expressing the antibody such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3 and 5 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify e.g. a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.

The present invention also provides polynucleotide sequences encoding VH and VK framework regions and CDRs of antibodies described herein as well as expression vectors for their efficient expression in mammalian cells.

Humanized antibodies described herein can be produced using a variety of techniques known in the art including but not limited to CDR grafting see e.g. European Patent No. EP 239 400 International Publication No. WO 91 09967 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 225 539 5 530 101 and 5 585 089 each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference veneering or resurfacing see e.g. European Patent Nos. EP 592 106 and EP 519 596 Padlan 1991 28 4 5 489 498 Studnicka et al. 1994 7 6 805 814 and Roguska et al. 1994 91 969 973 each of which is incorporated herein by its entirety by reference chain shuffling see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 565 332 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference and techniques disclosed in e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 407 213 U.S. Pat.

Often FW residues in the FW regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These FW substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and FW residues to identify FW residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual FW residues at particular positions. See e.g. Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 and Riechmann et al 1988 332 323 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. 

A humanized anti CD19 antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is nonhuman. These nonhuman amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Thus humanized antibodies comprise one or more CDRs from nonhuman immunoglobulin molecules and framework regions from human. Humanization of antibodies is well known in the art and can essentially be performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody i.e. CDR grafting EP 239 400 PCT Publication No. WO 91 09967 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 816 567 6 331 415 5 225 539 5 530 101 5 585 089 6 548 640 the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety . In such humanized chimeric antibodies substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a nonhuman species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FW residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. Humanization of anti CD19 antibodies can also be achieved by veneering or resurfacing EP 592 106 EP 519 596 Padlan 1991 28 4 5 489 498 Studnicka et al. 7 6 805 814 1994 and Roguska et al. 91 969 973 1994 or chain shuffling U.S. Pat. No. 5 565 332 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequences which are most closely related to that of the rodent are then screened for the presence of specific residues that may be critical for antigen binding appropriate structural formation and or stability of the intended humanized mAb Sims et al. 151 2296 1993 Chothia et al. 196 901 1987 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety . The resulting FW sequences matching the desired criteria are then be used as the human donor FW regions for the humanized antibody.

Another method uses a particular FW derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same FW may be used for several different humanized anti CD19 antibodies Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. 151 2623 1993 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety .

Anti CD19 antibodies can be humanized with retention of high affinity for CD19 and other favorable biological properties. According to one aspect of the invention humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind CD19. In this way FW residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic for example affinity for CD19 is achieved. In general the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

A humanized antibody may retain a similar antigenic specificity as the original antibody i.e. in the present invention the ability to bind human CD19 antigen. However using certain methods of humanization the affinity and or specificity of binding of the antibody for human CD19 antigen may be altered using methods of directed evolution as described by Wu et al. 294 151 1999 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety.

Humanized anti CD19 antibodies described herein can be constructed by the selection of distinct human framework regions for grafting of the HB12A or HB12B complementarity determining regions or CDR s as described in the sections that follow. The invention encompasses a number of humanized versions of the mouse HB12A and HB12B antibody as well as chimeric versions designated chHB12A and chHB12B.

A monoclonal anti CD19 antibody exhibits binding specificity to human CD19 antigen and may mediate human ADCC CDC and or apoptotic mechanisms. Such an antibody can be generated using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma recombinant and phage display technologies or a combination thereof. Antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. An engineered anti CD19 antibody can be produced by any means known in the art including but not limited to those techniques described below and improvements to those techniques. Large scale high yield production typically involves culturing a host cell that produces the engineered anti CD19 antibody and recovering the anti CD19 antibody from the host cell culture.

Monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught for example in Harlow et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 said references incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . For example in the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster or macaque monkey is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Lymphocytes may also be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Specific embodiments employ myeloma cells that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 or X63 Ag8.653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the human CD19 antigen. The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells can be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA .

After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

DNA encoding an anti CD19 antibody described herein is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of anti CD19 antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain the synthesis of anti CD19 antibodies in the recombinant host cells.

In phage display methods functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular DNA sequences encoding Vand Vdomains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries e.g. human or murine cDNA libraries of affected tissues . The DNA encoding the Vand Vdomains are recombined together with an scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector. The vector is electroporated in and the is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods is typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 and the Vand Vdomains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to a particular antigen can be selected or identified with antigen e.g. using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al. 1995 182 41 50 Ames et al. 1995 184 177 186 Kettleborough et al. 1994 24 952 958 Persic et al. 1997 187 9 18 Burton et al. 1994 57 191 280 International Application No. PCT GB91 01134 International Publication Nos.

As described in the above references after phage selection the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies including human antibodies or any other desired antigen binding fragment and expressed in any desired host including mammalian cells insect cells plant cells yeast and bacteria e.g. as described below. Techniques to recombinantly produce Fab Fab and F ab fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 92 22324 Mullinax et al. 1992 12 6 864 869 Sawai et al. 1995 34 26 34 and Better et al. 1988 240 1041 1043 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties .

Antibodies may be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 . Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies respectively using phage libraries. Chain shuffling can be used in the production of high affinity nM range human antibodies Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al 21 2265 2266 1993 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of anti CD19 antibodies.

To generate whole antibodies PCR primers including VH or VL nucleotide sequences a restriction site and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site can be used to amplify the VH or VL sequences in scFv clones. Utilizing cloning techniques known to those of skill in the art the PCR amplified VH domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a heavy chain constant region e.g. the human gamma 4 constant region and the PCR amplified VL domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a light chain constant region e.g. human kappa or lambda constant regions. The vectors for expressing the VH or VL domains may comprise an EF 1 promoter a secretion signal a cloning site for the variable domain constant domains and a selection marker such as neomycin. The VH and VL domains may also be cloned into one vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full length antibodies e.g. IgG using techniques known to those of skill in the art.

The DNA also may be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Morrison et al. 81 6851 1984 or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide.

The anti CD19 antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies immunoglobulins in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while another portion of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Morrison et al 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a nonhuman primate e.g. Old World Monkey such as baboon rhesus or cynomolgus monkey and human constant region sequences U.S. Pat. No. 5 693 780 .

Anti CD19 antibodies of compositions and methods described herein can be mutant antibodies. As used herein antibody mutant or altered antibody refers to an amino acid sequence variant of an anti CD19 antibody wherein one or more of the amino acid residues of an anti CD19 antibody have been modified. The modifications to the amino acid sequence of an anti CD19 antibody include modifications to the sequence that may improve affinity or avidity of the antibody for its antigen and or modifications to the Fc portion of the antibody that may improve effector function.

The present invention therefore relates to human humanized and chimeric anti CD19 antibodies disclosed herein as well as altered mutant derivatives thereof including but not limited to ones exhibiting altered human CD19 binding characteristics e.g. altered association constants k dissociation constants k and or equilibrium constant or binding affinity K. In certain embodiments the Kof an anti CD19 antibody described herein or an altered mutant derivative thereof for human CD19 may be no more than about 10M 10M 10M or 10M. Methods and reagents suitable for determination of such binding characteristics of an antibody of the present invention or an altered mutant derivative thereof are known in the art and or are commercially available se above and e.g. U.S. Pat.

Identity or similarity with respect to a sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical i.e. same residue or similar i.e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side chain properties see below with anti CD19 antibody residues after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N terminal C terminal or internal extensions deletions or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.

 identity as known in the art is a measure of the relationship between two polynucleotides or two polypeptides as determined by comparing their sequences. In general the two sequences to be compared are aligned to give a maximum correlation between the sequences. The alignment of the two sequences is examined and the number of positions giving an exact amino acid or nucleotide correspondence between the two sequences determined divided by the total length of the alignment and multiplied by 100 to give a identity figure. This identity figure may be determined over the whole length of the sequences to be compared which is particularly suitable for sequences of the same or very similar length and which are highly homologous or over shorter defined lengths which is more suitable for sequences of unequal length or which have a lower level of homology.

For example sequences can be aligned with the software clustalw under Unix which generates a file with an .aln extension this file can then be imported into the Bioedit program Hall T. A. 1999 95 98 41 95 98 which opens the .aln file. In the Bioedit window one can choose individual sequences two at a time and alignment them. This method allows for comparison of the entire sequence.

Methods for comparing the identity of two or more sequences are well known in the art. Thus for instance programs are available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package version 9.1 Devereux J. et al. 12 387 395 1984 available from Genetics Computer Group Madison Wis. USA . The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example the programs BESTFIT and GAP may be used to determine the identity between two polynucleotides and the identity between two polypeptide sequences. BESTFIT uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman 2 482 489 1981 and finds the best single region of similarity between two sequences. BESTFIT is more suited to comparing two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences which are dissimilar in length the program assuming that the shorter sequence represents a portion of the longer. In comparison GAP aligns two sequences finding a maximum similarity according to the algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch 48 443 354 1970 . GAP is more suited to comparing sequences which are approximately the same length and an alignment is expected over the entire length. Preferably the parameters Gap Weight and Length Weight used in each program are 50 and 3 for polynucleotides and 12 and 4 for polypeptides respectively. Preferably identities and similarities are determined when the two sequences being compared are optimally aligned.

Other programs for determining identity and or similarity between sequences are also known in the art for instance the BLAST family of programs Karlin Altschul 1990 87 2264 2268 modified as in Karlin Altschul 1993 90 5873 5877 available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCB Bethesda Md. USA and accessible through the home page of the NCBI at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . These programs are non limiting examples of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al. 1990 215 403 410. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program score 100 wordlength 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecule encoding all or a portion if an anti CD19 antibody of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program score 50 wordlength 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. 1997 25 3389 3402. PSI Blast can also be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules Id. . When utilizing BLAST Gapped BLAST and PSI Blast programs the default parameters of the respective programs e.g. XBLAST and NBLAST can be used. See http www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

Another non limiting example of a program for determining identity and or similarity between sequences known in the art is FASTA Pearson W. R. and Lipman D. J. 85 2444 2448 1988 available as part of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package . Preferably the BLOSUM62 amino acid substitution matrix Henikoff S and Henikoff J. G. 89 10915 10919 1992 is used in polypeptide sequence comparisons including where nucleotide sequences are first translated into amino acid sequences before comparison.

Yet another non limiting example of a program known in the art for determining identity and or similarity between amino acid sequences is SeqWeb Software a web based interface to the GCG Wisconsin Package Gap program which is utilized with the default algorithm and parameter settings of the program blosum62 gap weight 8 length weight 2.

The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity typically exact matches are counted.

Preferably the program BESTFIT is used to determine the identity of a query polynucleotide or a polypeptide sequence with respect to a polynucleotide or a polypeptide sequence of the present invention the query and the reference sequence being optimally aligned and the parameters of the program set at the default value.

To generate an altered antibody one or more amino acid alterations e.g. substitutions are introduced in one or more of the hypervariable regions of the species dependent antibody. One or more alterations e.g. substitutions of framework region residues may also be introduced in an anti CD19 antibody where these result in an improvement in the binding affinity of the antibody mutant for the antigen from the second mammalian species. Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non covalently bind antigen directly Amit et al. 233 747 753 1986 interact with effect the conformation of a CDR Chothia et al. 196 901 917 1987 and or participate in the V Vinterface EP 239 400B1 . In certain embodiments modification of one or more of such framework region residues results in an enhancement of the binding affinity of the antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species. For example from about one to about five framework residues may be altered in this embodiment of the invention. Sometimes this may be sufficient to yield an antibody mutant suitable for use in preclinical trials even where none of the hypervariable region residues have been altered. Normally however an altered antibody will comprise additional hypervariable region alteration s .

The hypervariable region residues which are altered may be changed randomly especially where the starting binding affinity of an anti CD19 antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species is such that such randomly produced altered antibody can be readily screened.

One useful procedure for generating such an altered antibody is called alanine scanning mutagenesis Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . Here one or more of the hypervariable region residue s are replaced by alanine or polyalanine residue s to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen from the second mammalian species. Those hypervariable region residue s demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing additional or other mutations at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. The Ala mutants produced this way are screened for their biological activity as described herein.

Another procedure for generating such an altered antibody involves affinity maturation using phage display Hawkins et al. 254 889 896 1992 and Lowman et al. 30 45 10832 10837 1991 . Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibody mutants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed mutants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed.

Mutations in antibody sequences may include substitutions deletions including internal deletions additions including additions yielding fusion proteins or conservative substitutions of amino acid residues within and or adjacent to the amino acid sequence but that result in a silent change in that the change produces a functionally equivalent anti CD19 antibody. Conservative amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity charge solubility hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. For example non polar hydrophobic amino acids include alanine leucine isoleucine valine proline phenylalanine tryptophan and methionine polar neutral amino acids include glycine serine threonine cysteine tyrosine asparagine and glutamine positively charged basic amino acids include arginine lysine and histidine and negatively charged acidic amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. In addition glycine and proline are residues that can influence chain orientation. Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for a member of another class. Furthermore if desired non classical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the antibody sequence. Non classical amino acids include but are not limited to the D isomers of the common amino acids amino isobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid Abu 2 amino butyric acid Abu Ahx 6 amino hexanoic acid Aib 2 amino isobutyric acid 3 amino propionic acid ornithine norleucine norvaline hydroxyproline sarcosine citrulline cysteic acid t butylglycine t butylalanine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine alanine fluoro amino acids designer amino acids such as methyl amino acids C methyl amino acids N methyl amino acids and amino acid analogs in general.

In another embodiment the sites selected for modification are affinity matured using phage display see above .

Any technique for mutagenesis known in the art can be used to modify individual nucleotides in a DNA sequence for purposes of making amino acid substitution s in the antibody sequence or for creating deleting restriction sites to facilitate further manipulations. Such techniques include but are not limited to chemical mutagenesis in vitro site directed mutagenesis Kunkel 82 488 1985 Hutchinson C. et al. 253 6551 1978 oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis Smith 19 423 463 1985 Hill et al. 155 558 568 1987 PCR based overlap extension Ho et al. 77 51 59 1989 PCR based megaprimer mutagenesis Sarkar et al. 8 404 407 1990 etc. Modifications can be confirmed by double stranded dideoxy DNA sequencing.

In certain embodiments of the invention an anti CD19 antibody can be modified to produce fusion proteins i.e. the antibody or a fragment thereof fused to a heterologous protein polypeptide or peptide. In certain embodiments the protein fused to the portion of an anti CD19 antibody is an enzyme component of Antibody Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy ADEPT . Examples of other proteins or polypeptides that can be engineered as a fusion protein with an anti CD19 antibody include but are not limited to toxins such as ricin abrin ribonuclease DNase I Staphylococcal enterotoxin A pokeweed anti viral protein gelonin diphtherin toxin exotoxin and endotoxin. See for example Pastan et al. 47 641 1986 and Goldenberg et al. 44 43 1994 . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain non binding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling . DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of the antiCD19 antibody or fragments thereof e.g. an antibody or a fragment thereof with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates . See generally U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 605 793 5 811 238 5 830 721 5 834 252 and 5 837 458 and Patten et al. 1997 8 724 33 Harayama 1998 16 2 76 82 Hansson et al. 1999 287 265 76 and Lorenzo and Blasco 1998 24 2 308 313 each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . The antibody can further be a binding domain immunoglobulin fusion protein as described in U.S. Publication 20030118592 U.S. Publication 200330133939 and PCT Publication WO 02 056910 all to Ledbetter et al. which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

Anti CD19 antibodies of compositions and methods of the invention can be domain antibodies e.g. antibodies containing the small functional binding units of antibodies corresponding to the variable regions of the heavy V or light V chains of human antibodies. Examples of domain antibodies include but are not limited to those available from Domantis Limited Cambridge UK and Domantis Inc. Cambridge Mass. USA that are specific to therapeutic targets see for example WO04 058821 WO04 003019 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 291 158 6 582 915 6 696 245 and 6 593 081 . Commercially available libraries of domain antibodies can be used to identify anti CD19 domain antibodies. In certain embodiments anti CD19 antibodies comprise a CD19 functional binding unit and a Fc gamma receptor functional binding unit.

In one embodiment an anti CD19 domain antibody may comprise any one of or any combination of the CDRs of the heavy or light chains of the HB12A or HB12B monoclonal antibodies.

In another embodiment an anti CD19 domain antibody may comprise CDR3 of HB12A or HB12B VHs together with any combination of the CDRs comprised by the heavy or light chains variable regions of the HB12A or HB12B monoclonal antibodies. An anti CD19 domain antibody may also comprise CDR3 of HB12A or HB12B VKs together with any combination of the CDRs comprised by the heavy or light chains variable regions of the HB12A or HB12B monoclonal antibodies.

In yet another embodiment an anti CD19 domain antibody may comprise CDR3 of HB12A or HB12B VHs. An anti CD19 domain antibody may also comprise CDR3 of HB12A or HB12B VKs.

In certain embodiments of the invention anti CD19 antibodies are diabodies . The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain V connected to a light chain variable domain V in the same polypeptide chain V V . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 .

In certain embodiments of the invention anti CD19 antibodies are Vaccibodies. Vaccibodies are dimeric polypeptides. Each monomer of a vaccibody consists of a scFv with specificity for a surface molecule on APC connected through a hinge region and a C 3 domain to a second scFv. In other embodiments of the invention vaccibodies containing as one of the scFv s an anti CD19 antibody fragment may be used to juxtapose those B cells to be destroyed and an effector cell that mediates ADCC. For example see Bogen et al U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040253238.

In certain embodiments of the invention anti CD19 antibodies are linear antibodies. Linear antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments V C V C which form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific. See Zapata et al. 8 10 1057 1062 1995 .

In certain embodiments of the invention anti CD19 antibody is a parent antibody. A parent antibody is an antibody comprising an amino acid sequence which may lack or may be deficient in one or more amino acid residues in or adjacent to one or more hypervariable regions thereof compared to an altered mutant antibody as herein disclosed. Thus the parent antibody may have a shorter hypervariable region than the corresponding hypervariable region of an antibody mutant as herein disclosed. The parent polypeptide may comprise a native antibody sequence i.e. a naturally occurring including a naturally occurring allelic variant or an antibody sequence with pre existing amino acid sequence modifications such as other insertions deletions and or substitutions of a naturally occurring sequence. The parent antibody may be a humanized antibody or a human antibody.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of a full length antibody generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Fab SH fragments can also be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See for example WO 93 16185. In certain embodiments the antibody is not a Fab fragment.

Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the B cell surface marker. Other such antibodies may bind a first B cell marker and further bind a second B cell surface marker. An anti B cell marker binding arm may also be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD2 or CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the B cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to the B cell. These antibodies possess a B cell marker binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain metholaexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. See for example Millstein et al. 305 537 539 1983 Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 474 893 4 714 681 4 925 648 5 573 920 5 601 81 95 731 168 4 676 980 and 4 676 980 WO 94 04690 WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 WO 93 17715 WO 92 08802 and EP 03089. 

In one embodiment where an anti CD19 antibody of compositions and methods of the invention is bispecific the anti CD19 antibody may be human or humanized and may have specificity for human CD19 and an epitope on a T cell or may be capable of binding to a human effector cell such as for example a monocyte macrophage and or a natural killer cell to effect cell death.

In one embodiment an anti CD19 antibody of the invention is a bispecific antibody capable of specifically binding to a first and second antigen wherein said first antigen is human CD19 and said second antigen is an Fc gamma receptor selected from the group consisting of Fc RI Fc RIIA Fc RIIB Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIV. In a further embodiment an anti CD19 antibody of the invention is a bispecific antibody capable of specifically binding to human CD19 and Fc RIIB. In another embodiment an anti CD19 antibody of the invention is a bispecific antibody capable of specifically binding to human CD19 and human Fc RIIB.

The present invention provides formulation of proteins comprising a variant Fc region. That is a non naturally occurring Fc region for example an Fc region comprising one or more non naturally occurring amino acid residues. Also encompassed by the variant Fc regions of present invention are Fc regions which comprise amino acid deletions additions and or modifications.

It will be understood that Fc region as used herein includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA IgD and IgG and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM and the flexible hinge N terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 C 2 and C 3 and the hinge between Cgamma1 C 1 and Cgamma2 C 2 . Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl terminus wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat et al. 1991 NIH Publication 91 3242 National Technical Information Service Springfield Va. . The EU index as set forth in Kabat refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody as described in Kabat et al. supra. Fc may refer to this region in isolation or this region in the context of an antibody antibody fragment or Fc fusion protein. An Fc variant protein may be an antibody Fc fusion or any protein or protein domain that comprises an Fc region including but not limited to proteins comprising variant Fc regions which are non naturally occurring variants of an Fc. Note Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions including but not limited to Kabat 270 272 312 315 356 and 358 and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art may exist.

The present invention encompasses Fc variant proteins which have altered binding properties for an Fc ligand e.g. an Fc receptor C1q relative to a comparable molecule e.g. a protein having the same amino acid sequence except having a wild type Fc region . Examples of binding properties include but are not limited to binding specificity equilibrium dissociation constant K dissociation and association rates kand krespectively binding affinity and or avidity. It is generally understood that a binding molecule e.g. a Fc variant protein such as an antibody with a low Kmay be preferable to a binding molecule with a high K. However in some instances the value of the kor kmay be more relevant than the value of the K. One skilled in the art can determine which kinetic parameter is most important for a given antibody application.

The affinities and binding properties of an Fc domain for its ligand may be determined by a variety of in vitro assay methods biochemical or immunological based assays known in the art for determining Fc Fc R interactions i.e. specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc R including but not limited to equilibrium methods e.g. enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA or radioimmunoassay RIA or kinetics e.g. BIACORE analysis and other methods such as indirect binding assays competitive inhibition assays fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET gel electrophoresis and chromatography e.g. gel filtration . These and other methods may utilize a label on one or more of the components being examined and or employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic fluorescent luminescent or isotopic labels. A detailed description of binding affinities and kinetics can be found in Paul W. E. ed. Fundamental Immunology 4th Ed. Lippincott Raven Philadelphia 1999 which focuses on antibody immunogen interactions.

In one embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to one or more Fc ligand relative to a comparable molecule. In another embodiment the Fc variant protein has an affinity for an Fc ligand that is at least 2 fold or at least 3 fold or at least 5 fold or at least 7 fold or a least 10 fold or at least 20 fold or at least 30 fold or at least 40 fold or at least 50 fold or at least 60 fold or at least 70 fold or at least 80 fold or at least 90 fold or at least 100 fold or at least 200 fold greater than that of a comparable molecule. In a specific embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to an Fc receptor. In another specific embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor Fc RIIIA. In a further specific embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced biding to the Fc receptor Fc RIIB. In still another specific embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor FcRn. In yet another specific embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to C1q relative to a comparable molecule.

In one embodiment an anti CD19 antibody of the invention comprises a variant Fc domain wherein said variant Fc domain has enhanced binding affinity to Fc gamma receptor IIB relative to a comparable non variant Fc domain. In a further embodiment an anti CD19 antibody of the invention comprises a variant Fc domain wherein said variant Fc domain has an affinity for Fc gamma receptor IIB that is at least 2 fold or at least 3 fold or at least 5 fold or at least 7 fold or a least 10 fold or at least 20 fold or at least 30 fold or at least 40 fold or at least 50 fold or at least 60 fold or at least 70 fold or at least 80 fold or at least 90 fold or at least 100 fold or at least 200 fold greater than that of a comparable non variant Fc domain.

The serum half life of proteins comprising Fc regions may be increased by increasing the binding affinity of the Fc region for FcRn. In one embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced serum half life relative to comparable molecule.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enables these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. Specific high affinity IgG antibodies directed to the surface of target cells arm the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. Lysis of the target cell is extracellular requires direct cell to cell contact and does not involve complement. It is contemplated that in addition to antibodies other proteins comprising Fc regions specifically Fc fusion proteins having the capacity to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell will be able to effect cell mediated cytotoxicity. For simplicity the cell mediated cytotoxicity resulting from the activity of an Fc fusion protein is also referred to herein as ADCC activity.

The ability of any particular Fc variant protein to mediate lysis of the target cell by ADCC can be assayed. To assess ADCC activity an Fc variant protein of interest is added to target cells in combination with immune effector cells which may be activated by the antigen antibody complexes resulting in cytolysis of the target cell. Cytolysis is generally detected by the release of label e.g. radioactive substrates fluorescent dyes or natural intracellular proteins from the lysed cells. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells.

Also encompassed by the present invention are Fc regions which comprise deletions additions and or modifications. Still other modifications substitutions additions deletions of the Fc domain will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art.

Methods for generating non naturally occurring Fc regions are known in the art. For example amino acid substitutions and or deletions can be generated by mutagenesis methods including but not limited to site directed mutagenesis Kunkel . USA 82 488 492 1985 PCR mutagenesis Higuchi in PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications Academic Press San Diego pp. 177 183 1990 and cassette mutagenesis Wells et al. Gene 34 315 323 1985 . Preferably site directed mutagenesis is performed by the overlap extension PCR method Higuchi in PCR Technology Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification Stockton Press New York pp. 61 70 1989 . The technique of overlap extension PCR Higuchi ibid. can also be used to introduce any desired mutation s into a target sequence the starting DNA . For example the first round of PCR in the overlap extension method involves amplifying the target sequence with an outside primer primer 1 and an internal mutagenesis primer primer 3 and separately with a second outside primer primer 4 and an internal primer primer 2 yielding two PCR segments segments A and B . The internal mutagenesis primer primer 3 is designed to contain mismatches to the target sequence specifying the desired mutation s . In the second round of PCR the products of the first round of PCR segments A and B are amplified by PCR using the two outside primers primers 1 and 4 . The resulting full length PCR segment segment C is digested with restriction enzymes and the resulting restriction fragment is cloned into an appropriate vector. As the first step of mutagenesis the starting DNA e.g. encoding an Fc fusion protein an antibody or simply an Fc region is operably cloned into a mutagenesis vector. The primers are designed to reflect the desired amino acid substitution. Other methods useful for the generation of variant Fc regions are known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat.

In still another embodiment the glycosylation of antibodies utilized in accordance with the invention is modified. For example an aglycoslated antibody can be made i.e. the antibody lacks glycosylation . Glycosylation can be altered to for example increase the affinity of the antibody for a target antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by for example altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 714 350 and 6 350 861. One or more amino acid substitutions can also be made that result in elimination of a glycosylation site present in the Fc region e.g. Asparagine 297 of IgG . Furthermore aglycosylated antibodies may be produced in bacterial cells which lack the necessary glycosylation machinery.

An antibody can also be made that has an altered type of glycosylation such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNAc structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by for example expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. See for example Shields R. L. et al. 2002 J. Biol. Chem. 277 26733 26740 Umana et al. 1999 Nat. Biotech. 17 176 1 as well as U.S. Pat. No. 6 946 292 European Patent No EP 1 176 195 PCT Publications WO 03 035835 WO 99 54342 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

It may be desirable to modify an anti CD19 antibody of the invention with respect to effector function so as to enhance the effectiveness of the antibody in treating B cell malignancies for example. For example cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. 53 2560 2565 1993 . An antibody can also be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. 3 219 230 1989 .

Other methods of engineering Fc regions of antibodies so as to alter effector functions are known in the art e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040185045 and PCT Publication No. WO 2004 016750 both to Koenig et al. which describe altering the Fc region to enhance the binding affinity for Fc RIIB as compared with the binding affinity for FC RIIA see also PCT Publication Nos. WO 99 58572 to Armour et al. WO 99 51642 to Idusogie et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 395 272 to Deo et al. the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties . Methods of modifying the Fc region to decrease binding affinity to Fc RIIB are also known in the art e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20010036459 and PCT Publication No. WO 01 79299 both to Ravetch et al. the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties . Modified antibodies having variant Fc regions with enhanced binding affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA as compared with a wildtype Fc region have also been described e.g. PCT Publication Nos. WO 2004 063351 to Stavenhagen et al. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety .

In vitro assays known in the art can be used to determine whether anti CD19 antibodies used in compositions and methods of the invention are capable of mediating ADCC such as those described herein.

Once a desired anti CD19 antibody is engineered the anti CD19 antibody can be produced on a commercial scale using methods that are well known in the art for large scale manufacturing of antibodies. For example this can be accomplished using recombinant expressing systems such as but not limited to those described below.

Recombinant expression of an antibody or variant thereof generally requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody or portion thereof has been obtained the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 331 415 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Thus methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule a heavy or light chain of an antibody a heavy or light chain variable domain of an antibody or a portion thereof or a heavy or light chain CDR operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule see e.g. International Publication Nos. WO 86 05807 and WO 89 01036 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 464 and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy the entire light chain or both the entire heavy and light chains.

In another embodiment anti CD19 antibodies can be made using targeted homologous recombination to produce all or portions of the anti CD19 antibodies see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 063 630 6 187 305 and 6 692 737 . In certain embodiments anti CD19 antibodies can be made using random recombination techniques to produce all or portions of the anti CD19 antibodies see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 361 972 6 524 818 6 541 221 and 6 623 958 . Anti CD19 antibodies can also be produced in cells expressing an antibody from a genomic sequence of the cell comprising a modified immunoglobulin locus using Cre mediated site specific homologous recombination see U.S. Pat. No. 6 091 001 . The host cell line may be derived from human or nonhuman species including but not limited to mouse and Chinese hamster. Where human or humanized antibody production is desired the host cell line should be a human cell line. These methods may advantageously be used to engineer stable cell lines which permanently express the antibody molecule.

Once the expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody. Thus the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention or fragments thereof or a heavy or light chain thereof or portion thereof or a single chain antibody of the invention operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In certain embodiments for the expression of double chained antibodies vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule as detailed below.

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express an anti CD19 antibody or portions thereof that can be used in the engineering and generation of anti CD19 antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 715 . For example mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies Foecking et al. 45 101 1986 and Cockett et al. 8 2 1990 . In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of inserted antibody sequences or modifies and processes the antibody gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the antibody or portion thereof expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK Hela COS MDCK 293 3T3 W138 BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT2O and T47D NS0 a murine myeloma cell line that does not endogenously produce any functional immunoglobulin chains CRL7O3O and HsS78Bst cells.

In one embodiment human cell lines developed by immortalizing human lymphocytes can be used to recombinantly produce monoclonal human anti CD19 antibodies. In one embodiment the human cell line PER.C6. Crucell Netherlands can be used to recombinantly produce monoclonal human anti CD19 antibodies.

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such an antibody is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions comprising an anti CD19 antibody vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. 12 1791 1983 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye 1985 13 3101 3109 1985 Van Heeke Schuster 1989 24 5503 5509 1989 and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to glutathione agarose affinity matrix followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to introduce athrombin and or factor Xa protease cleavage sites into the expressed polypeptide so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non essential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of virus based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion into a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts e.g. see Logan Shenk 81 355 359 1984 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon should generally be in frame with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see e.g. Bittner et al. 153 51 544 1987 .

Stable expression can be used for long term high yield production of recombinant proteins. For example cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be generated. Host cells can be transformed with an appropriately engineered vector comprising expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker gene. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells that stably integrated the plasmid into their chromosomes to grow and form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. Plasmids that encode an anti CD19 antibody can be used to introduce the gene cDNA into any cell line suitable for production in culture.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. 11 223 1977 hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski 48 202 1992 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 22 8 17 1980 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprT cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 77 357 1980 O Hare et al. 78 1527 1981 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg 78 2072 1981 neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 Wu and Wu 3 87 95 1991 Tolstoshev 32 573 596 1993 Mulligan 260 926 932 1993 and Morgan and Anderson 62 191 217 1993 May TIB TECH 11 5 155 215 1993 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin Santerre et al. 30 147 1984 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone and such methods are described for example in Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons NY 1993 Kriegler Stockton Press NY 1990 and in Chapters 12 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds. John Wiley Sons NY 1994 Colberre Garapin et al. 1981 150 1 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel Vol. 3. Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. 3 257 1983 . Antibody expression levels may be amplified through the use recombinant methods and tools known to those skilled in the art of recombinant protein production including technologies that remodel surrounding chromatin and enhance transgene expression in the form of an active artificial transcriptional domain.

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical or different selectable markers. A single vector which encodes and is capable of expressing both heavy and light chain polypeptides may also be used. In such situations the light chain should be placed 5 to the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot 322 562 65 1986 and Kohler 1980 77 2197 1980 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

Once an antibody molecule has been produced by recombinant expression it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigens Protein A or Protein G and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly in the periplasmic space or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments is removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted into the periplasmic space of . Briefly cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate pH 3.5 EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride PMSF over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody mutant is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography hydrophobic interaction chromatography ion exchange chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and or affinity chromatography either alone or in combination with other purification steps. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody mutant. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CHdomain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 and performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25 M salt .

An anti CD19 antibody used in compositions and methods of the invention may be a human antibody or a humanized antibody that may mediate B cell lineage apoptosis and or human ADCC or can be selected from known anti CD19 antibodies that may mediate B lineage cell apoptosis and or human ADCC. In certain embodiments anti CD19 antibodies can be chimeric antibodies. In certain embodiments an anti CD19 antibody can be a monoclonal human humanized or chimeric anti CD19 antibody. An anti CD19 antibody used in compositions and methods of the invention may be a human antibody or a humanized antibody of the IgG1 or IgG3 human isotype or any IgG1 or IgG3 allele found in the human population.

While such antibodies can be generated using the techniques described above in other embodiments of the invention the murine antibodies HB12A and HB12B as described herein or other commercially available anti CD19 antibodies can be chimerized humanized or made into human antibodies.

For example known anti CD19 antibodies that can be used include but are not limited to HD37 IgG1 kappa DAKO North America Inc. Carpinteria Calif. BU12 Callard et al. 148 10 2983 7 1992 4G7 IgG1 Meeker et al. 3 4 305 20 1984 Winter J4.119 Beckman Coulter Krefeld Germany B43 PharMingen San Diego Calif. SJ25C1 BD PharMingen San Diego Calif.

In certain embodiments the antibody is an isotype switched variant of a known antibody e.g. to an IgG1 or IgG3 human isotype such as those described above.

An anti CD19 antibodies used in compositions and methods of the invention can be naked antibodies immunoconjugates or fusion proteins. Anti CD19 antibodies described above for use in compositions and methods of the invention may be able to reduce or deplete B cells and circulating immunoglobulin in a human treated therewith. Depletion of B cells can be in circulating B cells or in particular tissues such as but not limited to bone marrow spleen gut associated lymphoid tissues and or lymph nodes. Such depletion may be achieved via various mechanisms such as antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC and or by blocking of CD19 interaction with its intended ligand and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC inhibition of B cell proliferation and or induction of B cell death e.g. via apoptosis . By depletion of B cells it is meant a reduction in circulating B cells and or B cells in particular tissue s by at least about 25 40 50 65 75 80 85 90 95 or more. In particular embodiments virtually all detectable B cells are depleted from the circulation and or particular tissue s . By depletion of circulating immunoglobulin Ig it is meant a reduction by at least about 25 40 50 65 75 80 85 90 95 or more. In particular embodiments virtually all detectable Ig is depleted from the circulation.

Binding assays can be used to identify antibodies that bind the human CD19 antigen. Binding assays may be performed either as direct binding assays or as competition binding assays. Binding can be detected using standard ELISA or standard Flow Cytometry assays. In a direct binding assay a candidate antibody is tested for binding to human CD19 antigen. In certain embodiments the screening assays comprise in a second step determining the ability to cause cell death or apoptosis of B cells expressing human CD19. Competition binding assays on the other hand assess the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known anti CD19 antibody or other compound that binds human CD19.

In a direct binding assay the human CD19 antigen is contacted with a candidate antibody under conditions that allow binding of the candidate antibody to the human CD19 antigen. The binding may take place in solution or on a solid surface. The candidate antibody may have been previously labeled for detection. Any detectable compound can be used for labeling such as but not limited to a luminescent fluorescent or radioactive isotope or group containing same or a nonisotopic label such as an enzyme or dye. After a period of incubation sufficient for binding to take place the reaction is exposed to conditions and manipulations that remove excess or non specifically bound antibody. Typically it involves washing with an appropriate buffer. Finally the presence of a CD19 antibody complex is detected.

In a competition binding assay a candidate antibody is evaluated for its ability to inhibit or displace the binding of a known anti CD19 antibody or other compound to the human CD19 antigen. A labeled known binder of CD19 may be mixed with the candidate antibody and placed under conditions in which the interaction between them would normally occur with and without the addition of the candidate antibody. The amount of labeled known binder of CD19 that binds the human CD19 may be compared to the amount bound in the presence or absence of the candidate antibody.

In one embodiment the binding assay is carried out with one or more components immobilized on a solid surface to facilitate antibody antigen complex formation and detection. In various embodiments the solid support could be but is not restricted to polyvinylidene fluoride polycarbonate polystyrene polypropylene polyethylene glass nitrocellulose dextran nylon polyacrylamide and agarose. The support configuration can include beads membranes microparticles the interior surface of a reaction vessel such as a microtiter plate test tube or other reaction vessel. The immobilization of human CD19 or other component can be achieved through covalent or non covalent attachments. In one embodiment the attachment may be indirect i.e. through an attached antibody. In another embodiment the human CD19 antigen and negative controls are tagged with an epitope such as glutathione S transferase GST so that the attachment to the solid surface can be mediated by a commercially available antibody such as anti GST Santa Cruz Biotechnology .

For example such an affinity binding assay may be performed using the human CD19 antigen which is immobilized to a solid support. Typically the non mobilized component of the binding reaction in this case the candidate anti CD19 antibody is labeled to enable detection. A variety of labeling methods are available and may be used such as luminescent chromophore fluorescent or radioactive isotope or group containing same and nonisotopic labels such as enzymes or dyes. In one embodiment the candidate anti CD19 antibody is labeled with a fluorophore such as fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC available from Sigma Chemicals St. Louis . Such an affinity binding assay may be performed using the human CD19 antigen immobilized on a solid surface. Anti CD19 antibodies are then incubated with the antigen and the specific binding of antibodies is detected by methods known in the art including but not limited to BiaCore Analyses ELISA FMET and RIA methods.

Finally the label remaining on the solid surface may be detected by any detection method known in the art. For example if the candidate anti CD19 antibody is labeled with a fluorophore a fluorimeter may be used to detect complexes.

The human CD19 antigen can be added to binding assays in the form of intact cells that express human CD19 antigen or isolated membranes containing human CD19 antigen. Thus direct binding to human CD19 antigen may be assayed in intact cells in culture or in animal models in the presence and absence of the candidate anti CD19 antibody. A labeled candidate anti CD19 antibody may be mixed with cells that express human CD19 antigen or with crude extracts obtained from such cells and the candidate anti CD19 antibody may be added. Isolated membranes may be used to identify candidate anti CD19 antibodies that interact with human CD19. For example in a typical experiment using isolated membranes cells may be genetically engineered to express human CD19 antigen. Membranes can be harvested by standard techniques and used in an in vitro binding assay. Labeled candidate anti CD19 antibody e.g. fluorescent labeled antibody is bound to the membranes and assayed for specific activity specific binding is determined by comparison with binding assays performed in the presence of excess unlabeled cold candidate anti CD19 antibody. Soluble human CD19 antigen may also be recombinantly expressed and utilized in non cell based assays to identify antibodies that bind to human CD19 antigen. The recombinantly expressed human CD19 polypeptides can be used in the non cell based screening assays. Peptides corresponding to one or more of the binding portions of human CD19 antigen or fusion proteins containing one or more of the binding portions of human CD19 antigen can also be used in non cell based assay systems to identify antibodies that bind to portions of human CD19 antigen. In non cell based assays the recombinantly expressed human CD19 is attached to a solid substrate such as a test tube microtiter well or a column by means well known to those in the art see Ausubel et al. supra . The test antibodies are then assayed for their ability to bind to human CD19 antigen.

The binding reaction may also be carried out in solution. In this assay the labeled component is allowed to interact with its binding partner s in solution. If the size differences between the labeled component and its binding partner s permit such a separation the separation can be achieved by passing the products of the binding reaction through an ultrafilter whose pores allow passage of unbound labeled component but not of its binding partner s or of labeled component bound to its partner s . Separation can also be achieved using any reagent capable of capturing a binding partner of the labeled component from solution such as an antibody against the binding partner and so on.

In one embodiment for example a phage library can be screened by passing phage from a continuous phage display library through a column containing purified human CD19 antigen or derivative analog fragment or domain thereof linked to a solid phase such as plastic beads. By altering the stringency of the washing buffer it is possible to enrich for phage that express peptides with high affinity for human CD19 antigen. Phage isolated from the column can be cloned and affinities can be measured directly. Knowing which antibodies and their amino acid sequences confer the strongest binding to human CD19 antigen computer models can be used to identify the molecular contacts between CD19 antigen and the candidate antibody.

In another specific embodiment the solid support is membrane containing human CD19 antigen attached to a microtiter dish. Candidate antibodies for example can bind cells that express library antibodies cultivated under conditions that allow expression of the library members in the microtiter dish. Library members that bind to the human CD19 are harvested. Such methods are generally described by way of example in Parmley and Smith 1988 73 305 318 Fowlkes et al. 1992 13 422 427 PCT Publication No. WO94 18318 and in references cited hereinabove. Antibodies identified as binding to human CD19 antigen can be of any of the types or modifications of antibodies described above.

Antibodies of the human IgG class which have functional characteristics such a long half life in serum and the ability to mediate various effector functions are used in certain embodiments of the invention Wiley Liss Inc. Chapter 1 1995 . The human IgG class antibody is further classified into the following 4 subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4. A large number of studies have so far been conducted for ADCC and CDC as effector functions of the IgG class antibody and it has been reported that among antibodies of the human IgG class the IgG1 subclass has the highest ADCC activity and CDC activity in humans 65 88 1997 .

Expression of ADCC activity and CDC activity of the human IgG1 subclass antibodies generally involves binding of the Fc region of the antibody to a receptor for an antibody hereinafter referred to as Fc R existing on the surface of effector cells such as killer cells natural killer cells or activated macrophages. Various complement components can be bound. Regarding the binding it has been suggested that several amino acid residues in the hinge region and the second domain of C region hereinafter referred to as C 2 domain of the antibody are important 23 1098 1993 86 319 1995 65 88 1997 and that a sugar chain in the C 2 domain 65 88 1997 is also important.

Anti CD19 antibodies can be modified with respect to effector function e.g. so as to enhance ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in the Fc region of an antibody. Cysteine residue s may also be introduced in the Fc region allowing for interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. In this way a homodimeric antibody can be generated that may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and ADCC Caron et al. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes 148 2918 2922 1992 . Heterobifunctional cross linkers can also be used to generate homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity Wolff et al. 53 2560 2565 1993 . Antibodies can also be engineered to have two or more Fc regions resulting in enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities Stevenson et al. 3 219 230 1989 .

Other methods of engineering Fc regions of antibodies so as to alter effector functions are known in the art e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040185045 and PCT Publication No. WO 2004 016750 both to Koenig et al. which describe altering the Fc region to enhance the binding affinity for Fc RIIB as compared with the binding affinity for FC RIIA see also PCT Publication Nos. WO 99 58572 to Armour et al. WO 99 51642 to Idusogie et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 395 272 to Deo et al. the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties . Methods of modifying the Fc region to decrease binding affinity to Fc RIIB are also known in the art e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20010036459 and PCT Publication No. WO 01 79299 both to Ravetch et al. the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties . Modified antibodies having variant Fc regions with enhanced binding affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA as compared with a wildtype Fc region have also been described e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 2004 063351 to Stavenhagen et al. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety .

At least four different types of Fc R have been found which are respectively called Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 Fc RIII CD16 and Fc RIV. In human Fc RII and Fc RIII are further classified into Fc RIIa and Fc RIIb and Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIIb respectively. Fc R is a membrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily Fc RII Fc RIII and Fc RIV have an a chain having an extracellular region containing two immunoglobulin like domains Fc RI has an chain having an extracellular region containing three immunoglobulin like domains as a constituting component and the chain is involved in the IgG binding activity. In addition Fc RI and Fc RIII have a chain or chain as a constituting component which has a signal transduction function in association with the chain 18 709 2000 19 275 2001 . Fc RIV has been described by Bruhns et al. . Canada 27 3D 2004 .

To assess ADCC activity of an anti CD19 antibody of interest an in vitro ADCC assay can be used such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337. The assay may also be performed using a commercially available kit e.g. CytoTox 96 Promega . Useful effector cells for such assays include but are not limited to peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC Natural Killer NK cells and NK cell lines. NK cell lines expressing a transgenic Fc receptor e.g. CD16 and associated signaling polypeptide e.g. FC RI may also serve as effector cells see e.g. WO 2006 023148 A2 to Campbell . For example the ability of any particular antibody to mediate lysis of the target cell by complement activation and or ADCC can be assayed. The cells of interest are grown and labeled in vitro the antibody is added to the cell culture in combination with immune cells which may be activated by the antigen antibody complexes i.e. effector cells involved in the ADCC response. The antibody can also be tested for complement activation. In either case cytolysis of the target cells is detected by the release of label from the lysed cells. The extent of target cell lysis may also be determined by detecting the release of cytoplasmic proteins e.g. LDH into the supernatant. In fact antibodies can be screened using the patient s own serum as a source of complement and or immune cells. The antibodies that are capable of mediating human ADCC in the in vitro test can then be used therapeutically in that particular patient. ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may also be assessed in vivo e.g. in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. . USA 95 652 656 1998 . Moreover techniques for modulating i.e. increasing or decreasing the level of ADCC and optionally CDC activity of an antibody are well known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551. Antibodies of the present invention may be capable or may have been modified to have the ability of inducing ADCC and or CDC. Assays to determine ADCC function can be practiced using human effector cells to assess human ADCC function. Such assays may also include those intended to screen for antibodies that induce mediate enhance block cell death by necrotic and or apoptotic mechanisms. Such methods including assays utilizing viable dyes methods of detecting and analyzing caspases and assays measuring DNA breaks can be used to assess the apoptotic activity of cells cultured in vitro with an anti CD19 antibody of interest.

For example Annexin V or TdT mediated dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL assays can be carried out as described in Decker et al. USA 103 2718 2725 2004 to detect apoptotic activity. The TUNEL assay involves culturing the cell of interest with fluorescein labeled dUTP for incorporation into DNA strand breaks. The cells are then processed for analysis by flow cytometry. The Annexin V assay detects the appearance of phosphatidylserine PS on the outside of the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells using a fluorescein conjugated Annexin V that specifically recognizes the exposed PS molecules. Concurrently a viable dye such as propidium iodide can be used to exclude late apoptotic cells. The cells are stained with the labeled Annexin V and are analyzed by flow cytometry.

According to certain aspects of the invention therapeutic agents or toxins can be conjugated to chimerized human or humanized anti CD19 antibodies for use in compositions and methods of the invention.

Examples of linker molecules useful for conjugating DOTA to a polypeptide are commonly known in the art see for example DeNardo et al. Clin Cancer Res 4 10 2483 90 1998 Peterson et al. Bioconjug Chem 10 4 553 7 1999 and Zimmerman et al. Nucl Med Biol 26 8 943 50 1999 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

An anti CD19 antibody of the present invention may also be used in ADEPT by conjugating the antibody to a prodrug activating enzyme which converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent see WO81 01145 to an active anti cancer drug. See for example WO 88 07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278. The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active cytotoxic form.

Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate containing prodrugs into free drugs arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate containing prodrugs into free drugs cytosine deaminase useful for converting non toxic 5 fluorocytosine into the anti cancer drug 5 fluorouracil proteases such as serratia protease thermolysin subtilisin carboxypeptidases and cathepsins such as cathepsins B and L that are useful for converting peptide containing prodrugs into free drugs D alanylcarboxypeptidases useful for converting prodrugs that contain D amino acid substituents carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with lactams into free drugs and penicillin amidases such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups respectively into free drugs. Antibodies with enzymatic activity also known in the art as abzymes can be used as well to convert the prodrugs into free active drugs see e.g. Massey 328 457 458 1987 . Antibody abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme as desired to portions of a human affected by a B cell malignancy.

Antibodies of this invention may be covalently bound to the enzymes by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an anti CD19 antibody linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme may also be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art see e.g. Neuberger et al. 312 604 608 1984 .

Covalent modifications of an anti CD19 antibody are included within the scope of this invention. They may be made by chemical synthesis or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of the antibody if applicable. Other types of covalent modifications of an anti CD19 antibody are introduced into the molecule by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N or C terminal residues.

Cysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with haloacetates and corresponding amines such as chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Similarly iodo reagents may also be used. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone bromo 5 imidozoyl propionic acid chloroacetyl phosphate N alkylmaleimides 3 nitro 2 pyridyl disulfide methyl 2 pyridyl disulfide p chloromercuribenzoate 2 chloromercuri 4 nitrophenol or chloro 7 nitrobenzo 2 oxa 1 3 diazole.

Histidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5 7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para bromophenacyl bromide also is useful the reaction can be performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.

Lysyl and amino terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing amino containing residues and or amino containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate pyridoxal phosphate pyridoxal chloroborohydride trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid 0 methylisourea 2 4 pentanedione and transaminase catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.

Arginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents among them phenylglyoxal 2 3 butanedione 1 2 cyclohexanedione and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginyl residues generally requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pKa of the guanidine functional group. Furthermore these reagents may react with the amino groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon amino group.

The specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly N acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O acetyl tyrosyl species and 3 nitro derivatives respectively. Tyrosyl residues are iodinated using I or I to prepare labeled proteins for use in radioimmunoassay.

Carboxyl side groups aspartyl or glutamyl are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides R N C N R where R and R are different alkyl groups such as 1 cyclohexyl 3 2 morpholinyl 4 ethyl carbodiimide or 1 ethyl 3 4 azonia 4 4 dimethylpentyl carbodiimide. Furthermore aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.

Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently deamidated to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues respectively. These residues are deamidated under neutral or basic conditions. The deamidated form of these residues falls within the scope of this invention.

Other modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues methylation of the amino groups of lysine arginine and histidine side chains T. E. Creighton W.H. Freeman Co. San Francisco pp. 79 86 1983 acetylation of the N terminal amine and amidation of any C terminal carboxyl group.

Another type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the antibody. These procedures are advantageous in that they do not require production of the antibody in a host cell that has glycosylation capabilities for N or O linked glycosylation. Depending on the coupling mode used the sugar s may be attached to a arginine and histidine b free carboxyl groups c free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine d free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine threonine or hydroxyproline e aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine tyrosine or tryptophan or f the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO 87 05330 published 11 Sep. 1987 and in Aplin and Wriston CRC 259 306 1981 .

In other embodiments an anti CD19 mAb can be administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agents. For example CVB 1.5 g mcyclophosphamide 200 400 mg metoposide and 150 200 mg mcarmustine can be used in combination therapies of the invention. CVB is a regimen used to treat non Hodgkin s lymphoma Patti et al 51 18 1993 . Other suitable combination chemotherapeutic regimens are well known to those of skill in the art. See for example Freedman et al in Cancer Medicine Volume 2 3rd Edition Holland et al. eds. pp. 2028 2068 Lea Febiger 1993 .

Additional anti cancer drugs are 5 fluorouracil and leucovorin. These two agents may be useful when used in methods employing thalidomide and a topoisomerase inhibitor. In specific embodiments an anti cancer agent is not a chemotherapeutic agent.

In more particular embodiments the present invention also comprises the administration of an anti CD19 mAb in combination with the administration of one or more therapies such as but not limited to anti cancer agents such as those disclosed in Table 1 for the treatment of breast ovary melanoma prostate colon and lung cancers as described above. When used in a combination therapy the dosages and or the frequency of administration listed in Table 2 may be decreased.

The invention also encompasses administration of an anti CD19 mAb in combination with radiation therapy comprising the use of x rays gamma rays and other sources of radiation to destroy the cancer cells. In particular embodiments the radiation treatment is administered as external beam radiation or teletherapy wherein the radiation is directed from a remote source. In other embodiments the radiation treatment is administered as internal therapy or brachytherapy wherein a radiaoactive source is placed inside the body close to cancer cells or a tumor mass.

Cancer therapies and their dosages routes of administration and recommended usage are known in the art and have been described in such literature as the 56ed. 2002 .

The invention also relates to immunotherapeutic compositions and methods for the treatment of B cell diseases and disorders in human subjects such as but not limited to B cell malignancies to immunotherapeutic compositions and methods for the treatment and prevention of GVHD graft rejection and post transplant lymphocyte proliferative disorder in human transplant recipients and to immunotherapeutic compositions and methods for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and disorders in human subjects using therapeutic antibodies that bind to the CD19 antigen and may mediate human ADCC.

The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising human humanized or chimeric anti CD19 antibodies of the IgG1 or IgG3 human isotype. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising human or humanized anti CD19 antibodies of the IgG2 or IgG4 human isotype that may mediate human ADCC. In certain embodiments the present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising monoclonal human humanized or chimerized anti CD19 antibodies that can be produced by means known in the art.

Therapeutic formulations and regimens are described for treating human subjects diagnosed with B cell malignancies that derive from B cells and their precursors including but not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemias ALL Hodgkin s lymphomas non Hodgkin s lymphomas B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias CLL multiple myeloma follicular lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma pro lymphocytic leukemias hairy cell leukemias common acute lymphocytic leukemias and some Null acute lymphoblastic leukemias.

In other particular embodiments anti CD19 antibodies may mediate ADCC complement dependent cellular cytoxicity or apoptosis. Compositions and methods of the present invention also have the advantage of targeting a wider population of B cells than other B cell directed immunotherapies. For example anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention may be effective to target bone marrow cells circulating B cells and mature antibody secreting B cells. Accordingly methods and compositions of the invention may be effective to reduce or deplete circulating B cells as well as circulating immunoglobulin.

Accordingly in one aspect the invention provides compositions and methods for the treatment and prevention of GVHD graft rejection and post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder which are associated with fewer and or less severe complications than less targeted therapeutic agents and regimens. In one embodiment compositions and methods of the invention are used with lower doses of traditional therapeutic agents than would be possible in the absence of the methods and compositions of the invention. In another embodiment compositions and methods of the invention obviate the need for a more severe form of therapy such as radiation therapy high dose chemotherapy or splenectomy.

In certain embodiments anti CD19 antibodies and compositions may be administered to a transplant recipient patient prior to or following transplantation alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents or regimens for the treatment or prevention of GVHD and graft rejection. For example anti CD19 antibodies and compositions may be used to deplete alloantibodies from a transplant recipient prior to or following transplantation of an allogeneic graft. Anti CD19 antibodies and compositions may also be used to deplete antibody producing cells from the graft ex vivo prior to transplantation or in the donor or as prophylaxis against GVHD and graft rejection.

Pharmaceutical formulations of the invention contain as the active ingredient human humanized or chimeric anti CD19 antibodies. The formulations contain naked antibody immunoconjugate or fusion protein in an amount effective for producing the desired response in a unit of weight or volume suitable for administration to a human patient and are preferably sterile. The response can for example be measured by determining the physiological effects of the anti CD19 antibody composition such as but not limited to circulating B cell depletion tissue B cell depletion regression of a B cell malignancy or decrease of disease symptoms. Other assays will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art and can be employed for measuring the level of the response.

An anti CD19 antibody composition may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term pharmaceutically acceptable means one or more non toxic materials that do not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredients. Such preparations may routinely contain salts buffering agents preservatives compatible carriers and optionally other therapeutic agents. Such pharmaceutically acceptable preparations may also routinely contain compatible solid or liquid fillers diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration into a human. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable but non pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and are not excluded from the scope of the invention. Such pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not limited to those prepared from the following acids hydrochloric hydrobromic sulfuric nitric phosphoric maleic acetic salicylic citric boric formic malonic succinic and the like. Also pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts such as sodium potassium or calcium salts. The term carrier denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient natural or synthetic with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being co mingled with the antibodies of the present invention and with each other in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficacy.

According to certain aspects of the invention anti CD19 antibody compositions can be prepared for storage by mixing the antibody or immunoconjugate having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1999 in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptide proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG .

Anti CD19 antibody compositions also may contain optionally suitable preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride chlorobutanol parabens and thimerosal.

Anti CD19 antibody compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active agent into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general anti CD19 antibody compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active compound into association with a liquid carrier a finely divided solid carrier or both and then if necessary shaping the product.

Compositions suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous or non aqueous preparation of anti CD19 antibody which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. This preparation may be formulated according to known methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation also may be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or di glycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid may be used in the preparation of injectables. Carrier formulation suitable for oral subcutaneous intravenous intramuscular etc. administration can be found in Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. In certain embodiments carrier formulation suitable for various routes of administration can be the same or similar to that described for RITUXAN . See Medical Economics Company Inc. Montvale N.J. 2005 pp. 958 960 and 1354 1357 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In certain embodiments of the invention anti CD19 antibody compositions are formulated for intravenous administration with sodium chloride sodium citrate dihydrate polysorbate 80 and sterile water where the pH of the composition is adjusted to approximately 6.5. Those of skill in the art are aware that intravenous injection provides a useful mode of administration due to the thoroughness of the circulation in rapidly distributing antibodies. Intravenous administration however is subject to limitation by a vascular barrier comprising endothelial cells of the vasculature and the subendothelial matrix. Still the vascular barrier is a more notable problem for the uptake of therapeutic antibodies by solid tumors. Lymphomas have relatively high blood flow rates contributing to effective antibody delivery. Intralymphatic routes of administration such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or by catheterization of lymphatic vessels also provide a useful means of treating B cell lymphomas. In certain embodiments anti CD19 antibodies of compositions and methods of the invention are self administered subcutaneously. In such embodiments the composition is formulated as a lyophilized drug or in a liquid buffer e.g. PBS and or citrate at about 50 mg mL.

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example it may be desirable to further provide an immunosuppressive agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsule and poly methylmethacylate microcapsule respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration are typically sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing an anti CD19 antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsule. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devized for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions. In certain embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in compositions of the invention do not affect human ADCC or CDC.

Anti CD19 antibody compositions disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug such as anti CD19 antibodies disclosed herein to a human. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing antibodies of the invention are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 82 3688 1985 Hwang et al. 77 4030 1980 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. The antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 257 286 288 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A therapeutic agent can also be contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. . 19 1484 1989 .

The specified dosage can result in B cell depletion in the human treated using compositions and methods of the invention for a period of at least about 1 2 3 5 7 10 14 20 30 45 60 75 90 120 150 or 180 days or longer. In certain embodiments pre B cells not expressing surface immunoglobulin are depleted. In certain embodiments mature B cells expressing surface immunoglobulin are depleted. In other embodiments all non malignant types of B cells can exhibit depletion. Any of these types of B cells can be used to measure B cell depletion.

According to these embodiments the dosage can be administered by any suitable route but is optionally administered by a subcutaneous route.

As another aspect the invention provides the discovery that B cell depletion and or treatment of B cell disorders can be achieved at lower dosages of antibody or antibody fragments than employed in currently available methods. Thus in another embodiment the invention provides a method of depleting B cells and or treating a B cell disorder comprising administering to a human an effective amount of an antibody that specifically binds to CD19 wherein a dosage of about 500 475 450 425 400 375 350 325 300 275 250 225 200 175 150 125 100 75 60 50 37.5 20 10 5 2.5 1 0.5 0.375 0.25 0.1 0.075 0.05 0.001 0.0005 mg mor less results in a depletion of B cells circulating and or tissue B cells of 25 35 50 60 75 80 85 90 95 98 or more for a period at least about 3 5 7 10 14 21 30 45 60 75 90 120 150 180 or 200 days or longer. In representative embodiments a dosage of about 125 mg m2 or 75 mg mor less results in at least about 50 75 85 or 90 depletion of B cells for at least about 7 14 21 30 60 75 90 120 150 or 180 days. In other embodiments a dosage of about 50 37.5 or 10 mg mresults in at least about a 50 75 85 or 90 depletion of B cells for at least about 7 14 21 30 60 75 90 120 or 180 days. In still other embodiments a dosage of about 0.375 or 0.1 mg mresults in at least about a 50 75 85 or 90 depletion of B cells for at least about 7 14 21 30 60 75 or 90 days. In further embodiments a dosage of about 0.075 0.01 0.001 or 0.0005 mg mresults in at least about a 50 75 85 or 90 depletion of B cells for at least about 7 14 21 30 or 60 days.

In certain embodiments of the invention the dose can be escalated or reduced to maintain a constant dose in the blood or in a tissue such as but not limited to bone marrow. In related embodiments the dose is escalated or reduced by about 2 5 8 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 and 95 in order to maintain a desired level of an antibody of compositions and methods of the invention.

In certain embodiments the dosage can be adjusted and or the infusion rate can be reduced based on patient s immunogenic response to compositions and methods of the invention.

According to one aspect of methods of the invention a loading dose of an anti CD19 antibody and or composition of the invention can be administered first followed by a maintenance dose until the B cell malignancy being treated progresses or followed by a defined treatment course e.g. CAMPATH MYLOTARG or RITUXAN the latter of which allow patients to be treated for a defined number of doses that has increased as additional data have been generated .

According to another aspect of methods of the invention a patient may be pretreated with compositions and methods of the invention to detect minimize immunogenic response or minimize adverse effects of compositions and methods of the invention.

The tolerance toxicity and or efficacy of the compositions and or treatment regimens of the present invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD50 the dose lethal to 50 of the population the ED50 the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population and IC50 the dose effective to achieve a 50 inhibition . In one embodiment the dose is a dose effective to achieve at least a 60 70 80 90 95 or 99 depletion of circulating B cells or circulating immunoglobulin or both. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50 ED50. Therapies that exhibit large therapeutic indices may be preferred. While therapies that exhibit toxic side effects may be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to CD19 expressing cells in order to minimize potential damage to CD19 negative cells and thereby reduce side effects.

Data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages of the compositions and or treatment regimens for use in humans. The dosage of such agents may lie within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any therapy used in methods of the invention a therapeutically effective dose can be estimated by appropriate animal models. Depending on the species of the animal model the dose can be scaled for human use according to art accepted formulas for example as provided by Freireich et al. Quantitative comparison of toxicity of anticancer agents in mouse rat monkey dog and human NCI 1966 40 219 244. Data obtained from cell culture assays can be useful for predicting potential toxicity. Animal studies can be used to formulate a specific dose to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 i.e. the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Plasma drug levels may be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography ELISA or by cell based assays.

According to certain aspects of the invention the treatment regimen and dose used with compositions and methods of the invention is chosen based on a number of factors including but not limited to the stage of the B cell disease or disorder being treated. Appropriate treatment regimens can be determined by one of skill in the art for particular stages of a B cell disease or disorder in a patient or patient population. Dose response curves can be generated using standard protocols in the art in order to determine the effective amount of compositions of the invention for treating patients having different stages of a B cell disease or disorder. In general patients having more advanced stages of a B cell disease or disorder will require higher doses and or more frequent doses which may be administered over longer periods of time in comparison to patients having an early stage B cell disease or disorder.

Anti CD19 antibodies compositions and methods of the invention may be practiced to treat B cell diseases including B cell malignancies. The term B cell malignancy includes any malignancy that is derived from a cell of the B cell lineage. Exemplary B cell malignancies include but are not limited to B cell subtype non Hodgkin s lymphoma NHL including low grade follicular NHL small lymphocytic SL NHL intermediate grade follicular NHL intermediate grade diffuse NHL high grade immunoblastic NHL high grade lymphoblastic NHL high grade small non cleaved cell NHL mantle cell lymphoma and bulky disease NHL Burkitt s lymphoma multiple myeloma pre B acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other malignancies that derive from early B cell precursors common acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL including immunoglobulin mutated CLL and immunoglobulin unmutated CLL hairy cell leukemia Null acute lymphoblastic leukemia Waldenstrom s Macroglobulinemia diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL including germinal center B cell like GCB DLBCL activated B cell like ABC DLBCL and type 3 DLBCL pro lymphocytic leukemia light chain disease plasmacytoma osteosclerotic myeloma plasma cell leukemia monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance MGUS smoldering multiple myeloma SMM indolent multiple myeloma IMM Hodgkin s lymphoma including classical and nodular lymphocyte pre dominant type lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma LPL and marginal zone lymphoma including gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma.

In a further embodiment the invention can be employed to treat mature B cell malignancies i.e. express Ig on the cell surface including but not limited to follicular lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma Burkitt s lymphoma multiple myeloma diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL including germinal center B cell like GCB DLBCL activated B cell like ABC DLBCL and type 3 DLBCL Hodgkin s lymphoma including classical and nodular lymphocyte pre dominant type lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma LPL marginal zone lymphoma including gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL including immunoglobulin mutated CLL and immunoglobulin unmutated CLL.

Further CD19 is expressed earlier in B cell development than for example CD20 and is therefore particularly suited for treating pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies i.e. do not express Ig on the cell surface for example in the bone marrow. Illustrative pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies include but are not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The progression of cancer such as a B cell disease or disorder capable of tumor formation e.g. non Hodgkin lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma is typically characterized by the degree to which the cancer has spread through the body and is often broken into the following four stages which are prognostic of outcome. Stage I The cancer is localized to a particular tissue and has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage II The cancer has spread to the nearby lymph nodes i.e. metastasis. Stage III The cancer is found in the lymph nodes in regions of the body away from the tissue of origin and may comprise a mass or multiple tumors as opposed to one. Stage IV The cancer has spread to a distant part of the body. The stage of a cancer can be determined by clinical observations and testing methods that are well known to those of skill in the art. The stages of cancer described above are traditionally used in conjunction with clinical diagnosis of cancers characterized by tumor formation and can be used in conjunction with the compositions and methods of the present invention to treat B cell diseases and disorders. Typically early stage disease means that the disease remains localized to a portion of a patient s body or has not metastasized.

With respect to non tumor forming B cell diseases and disorders such as but not limited to multiple myeloma the criteria for determining the stage of disease differs. The Durie Salmon Staging System has been widely used. In this staging system clinical stage of disease stage I II or III is based on several measurements including levels of M protein the number of lytic bone lesions hemoglobin values and serum calcium levels. Stages are further divided according to renal kidney function classified as A or B . According to the Durie Salmon Staging System Stage I low cell mass is characterized by all of the following Hemoglobin value 10 g dL Serum calcium value normal or 12 mg dL Bone x ray normal bone structure scale 0 or solitary bone plasmacytoma only and Low M component production rate IgG value 12 g 24 h Subclassification either A or B where A is Relatively normal renal function serum creatinine value 

Another staging system for myeloma is the International Staging System ISS for myeloma. This system can more effectively discriminate between staging groups and is based on easily measured serum levels of beta 2 microglobulin 2 M and albumin. According to the ISS for myeloma Stage I is characterized by 2 M 

The stage of a B cell malignancy in a patient is a clinical determination. As indicated above with respect to solid tumors the spread location and number of tumors are the primary factors in the clinical determination of stage. Determination of stage in patients with non tumor forming B cell malignancies can be more complex requiring serum level measurements as described above.

The descriptions of stages of B cell diseases and disorders above are not limiting. Other characteristics known in the art for the diagnosis of B cell diseases and disorders can be used as criteria for patients to determine stages of B cell diseases or disorders.

Diagnostic criteria for different B cell malignancies are known in the art. Historically diagnosis is typically based on a combination of microscopic appearance and immunophenotype. More recently molecular techniques such as gene expression profiling have been applied to develop molecular definitions of B cell malignancies see e.g. Shaffer et al. 2 920 932 2002 . Exemplary methods for clinical diagnosis of particular B cell malignancies are provided below. Other suitable methods will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

In general most NHL with the exception of mantle cell lymphoma have highly mutated immunoglobulin genes that appear to be the result of somatic hypermutation SHM . The most common genetic abnormalities in NHL are translocations and mutations of the BCL6 gene.

Follicular NHL is often an indolent B cell lymphoma with a follicular growth pattern. It is the second most common lymphoma in the United States and Western Europe. The median age at which this disease presents is 60 years and there is a slight female predominance. Painless lymphadenopathy is the most common symptom. Tests often indicate involvement of the blood marrow and sometimes the peripheral blood. Follicular NHL is divided into cytologic grades based on the proportion of large cells in the follicle with the grades forming a continuum from follicular small cleaved cell to large cell predominance. See S. Freedman et al. pp. 367 388 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 T. Lister et al. pp. 309 324 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Most follicular NHL is characterized by a translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18 resulting in overexpression of BCL2. Follicular NHL is also characterized by both SHM and ongoing SHM and a gene expression profile similar to germinal center GC B cells see e.g. Shaffer et al. 2 920 932 2002 which are the putative cells of origin for this malignancy. Heavy and light chain rearrangements are typical. The tumor cells of this disease express monoclonal surface immunoglobulin with most expressing IgM. Nearly all follicular NHL tumor cells express the antigens CD19 CD20 CD22 CD79a CD21 CD35 and CD10 but lack expression of CD5 and CD43. Paratrabecular infiltration with small cleaved cells is observed in the bone marrow. See S. Freedman et al. pp. 367 388 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 T. Lister et al. pp. 309 324 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Diagnosis of follicular NHL generally relies on biopsy of an excised node in order to evaluate tissue architecture and cytological features. Fine needle aspirations are usually not adequate since this procedure is less likely to provide tissue that can be evaluated and it fails to provide enough tissue for additional tests. Bilateral bone marrow biopsies are also indicated since involvement can be patchy. Additional diagnostic procedures include chest x rays chest abdomen neck and pelvis computed tomography CT scans complete blood count and chemistry profile. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry can be used to distinguish between follicular NHL and other mature B cell lymphomas. See S. Freedman et al. pp. 367 388 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 T. Lister et al. pp. 309 324 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Mantle cell lymphoma localizes to the mantle region of secondary follicles and is characterized by a nodular and or diffuse growth pattern. Mantle cell lymphoma patients have median age of 60 65 years with the disease affecting predominantly males. For diagnostic purposes the usual presenting feature is a generalized lymphadenopathy. Additionally the spleen is often enlarged. This B cell lymphoma is associated with a t 11 14 between the IgH locus and cyclin D1 gene which results in overexpression of cyclin D1. More than 50 of cases show additional chromosomal abnormalities. Mantle cell lymphoma is typically not characterized by SHM. See W. Hiddemann et al. pp. 461 476 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 D. Weisenburger et al. pp. 28 41 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Immunophenotyping flow cytometry or frozen section immunohistochemistry of mantle cell lymphoma cells shows them to nearly always be monoclonal bearing surface IgM. Mantle cell lymphoma cells have also been noted to bear surface IgD. The cells express the antigens CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD24 but not CD23. They also express surface antigens CD5 but not for CD10 distinguishing them from true follicle center cell lymphomas which are almost always CD5 negative. Frequently extranodal involvement is found including bone marrow infiltration and tumors of the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Mild anemia and leukemic expression is not uncommon with mantle cell lymphoma. See A. Lal et al. pp. 181 220 In W. Finn et al. eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 W. Hiddemann et al. pp. 461 476 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma involves examination of the peripheral blood as well as bone marrow and lymph node biopsies. In addition cytogenetic studies and immunophenotyping are useful in differential diagnosis. See W. Hiddemann et al. pp. 461 476 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 D. Weisenburger et al. pp. 28 41 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Burkitt s lymphoma is an aggressive B cell lymphoma typically observed in children and young adults and is usually associated with bulky disease of the jaw and or abdomen. Approximately 20 of patients have bone marrow involvement. An endemic form of Burkitt s lymphoma involves Epstein Barr virus EBV infection of malignant cells the sporadic form is independent of EBV infection. A translocation of c myc to immunoglobulin loci which results in deregulation of the c myc gene is characteristic of this disease t 8 14 q24 q32 . Interestingly deletions of the c myc sequences appear to be involved in the sporadic form of the disease while the endemic form usually involves point mutations or insertions. See V. Pappa et al pp. 133 157 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 . Burkitt s lymphoma is also characterized by SHM and the malignant cells have a gene expression profile similar to GC B cells suggesting that this malignancy is derived from GC B cells.

Immunophenotype of Burkett s lymphoma shows the cells of this disease express CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD79a but not CD5 CD23 cyclin D or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Frequently these cells are positive for CD10 and BCL6 and usually negative for BCL2. See I. Magrath et al. pp. 477 501 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

High grade B cell Burkitt s like lymphoma is a lymphoma borderline between Burkitt s lymphoma and large B cell lymphoma. The cells of this lymphoma express CD19 CD20 and CD22 but expression of CD10 which is nearly always present in true Burkitt s lymphoma is frequently absent. Because of this and other characteristics some believe this lymphoma should be classified as a diffuse large B cell lymphoma. See K. Maclennan pp. 49 54 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Diagnosis of Burkitt s lymphoma generally relies on detection of the translocation associated with this lymphoma thus conventional cytogenetic analysis is usually performed. Long distance polymerase chain reaction techniques and fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH have been used to detect Ig myc junctions in the translocations and other genetic alterations associated with this disease. See R. Siebert et al. 91 984 990 1998 T. Denyssevych et al. 16 276 283 2002 .

DLBCL is the most common non Hodgkin s lymphoma and can arise from small B cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma. Typically patients present with lymphadenopathy however a large percent of patients present in extranodal sites as well with gastrointestinal involvement being the most common. Bone marrow involvement is observed in about 15 of patients. See Armitage et al. pp. 427 453 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 . Heterogeneity in clinical biological and morphological characteristics makes this group of lymphomas difficult to subclassify. However two distinct subgroups have been identified with one expressing genes characteristic of germinal center B cells GC DLBCL and the other overexpressing genes in peripheral blood B cells. Survival rates are significantly better for patients with GC DLBCL than those with activated B cell type ABC DLBCL. See W. Chan 128 12 1379 1384 2004 .

DLBCLs express the cell surface antigens CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD79a. CD10 is expressed in the large majority of cases and CD5 expression is observed in about 10 of cases. See K. Maclennan pp. 49 54 B. Hancock et al eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 . DLBCL is often marked by abnormalities of BCL6 and or translocations of BCL2 to the IgH locus. GC B cell like GC DLBCL is characterized by SHM with highly mutated immunoglobulin genes and ongoing SHM in malignant clones with a GC B cell like gene expression profile. Most GC DLBCL have undergone immunoglobulin class switching. ABC DLBCL is characterized by high level expression of NF B target genes including BCL2 interferon regulatory factor 4 CD44 FLIP and cyclin D. SHM but not ongoing SHM is present and ABC DLBCL does not have a GC B cell gene expression profile. Almost all ABC DLBCL express a high level of IgM.

Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma is an extranodal lymphoma that occurs in organs normally lacking organized lymphoid tissue e.g. stomach salivary glands lungs and thyroid glands . It is largely a disease that affects older adults with a median age of over 60 years. Often chronic inflammation or autoimmune processes precede development of the lymphoma. Gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma the most common type of marginal zone lymphoma is associated with infection. Studies have shown a resolution of symptoms with eradication of the infection following an antibiotic regimen. The presenting symptoms for gastric MALT lymphoma include nonspecific dyspepsia epigastric pain nausea gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. Systemic symptoms are uncommon as are elevated levels of lactate acid dehydrogenase. See J. Yahalom et al. pp. 345 360 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 J. Radford pp. 325 330 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 . Systemic B symptoms include fevers greater than 38 C. for longer than 2 weeks without sign of infection night sweats extreme fatigue or unintentional weight loss of greater than or equal to 10 of body weight over the previous 6 months .

The immunophenotype of MALT lymphoma is characterized by expression of CD19 CD20 CD79a CD21 and CD35 and lack of expression of CD5 CD23 and CD10. About half of MALT lymphomas express CD43. The immunoglobulin typically expressed in the tumor cells of this disease is IgM while IgD is not expressed. These features are critical in distinguishing this lymphoma from other small B cell lymphomas such as mantle cell lymphoma lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Trisomy 3 has been reported in 60 of MALT lymphoma cases. In 25 40 of gastric and pulmonary MALT lymphomas a t 11 18 is observed. This translocation is observed much less frequently in other MALT lymphomas. T 11 18 is associated with nuclear expression of BCL10. See J. Yahalom et al. pp. 345 360 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 . Marginal zone lymphomas are generally characterized by SHM and ongoing SHM.

Diagnostic procedures include immunophenotyping or flow cytometry to determine the identity of the cell surface markers. In addition molecular genetic analysis should be done to determine the presence of t 11 18 as this is an indicator that the disease will not respond to antibiotics. Histology can be used to determine the presence of . Additional tests should include a complete blood count basic biochemical tests including that for lactate acid dehydrogenase CT scans of the abdomen chest and pelvis and a bone marrow biopsy. See J. Yahalom et al. pp. 345 360 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Nodal Marginal Zone B cell Lymphoma is a relatively newly classified lymphoma thus little has been published on it. It is a primary nodal B cell lymphoma sharing genetic and morphological characteristics with extranodal and splenic marginal zone lymphomas but does not localize to the spleen or extranodally. Hepatitis C virus has been reported to be associated with this lymphoma as has Sj gren s syndrome. See F. Berger et al. pp. 361 365 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Nodal marginal zone lymphoma has a heterogeneous cytology and morphology. Due to its relatively high proportion of large cells this lymphoma unlike the other marginal lymphomas splenic and extranodal cannot be classified as true low grade B cell lymphoma. The genetic and immunological phenotype of nodal marginal zone lymphoma includes expression of CD19 CD20 CD22 BCL2 sIgM and cytoplasmic IgG cIg . These cells do not express CD5 CD10 CD23 CD43 or cyclin D1. The translocation characteristic of MALT lymphoma t 11 18 is not observed for nodal marginal zone lymphoma. These characteristics aid in the differential diagnosis of this lymphoma from other small B cell lymphomas. See F. Berger et al. pp. 361 365 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma is an indolent micro nodular B cell lymphoma with a characteristic clinical presentation of prominent splenomegaly and infiltration of the peripheral blood and the bone marrow. In addition a relatively high level of liver involvement has been reported. A role for hepatitis C virus has been postulated for this lymphoma. The immunophenotype of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is typically CD19 CD20 IgD BCL2 p27 CD3 CD5 CD10 CD23 CD38 CD43 BCL 6 and cyclin D1. Genetic characteristics include a 7q deletion p53 alterations and SHM. See M. Piris et al. pp. 275 282 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Diagnosis generally relies on immunophenotyping to determine the identity of the cell surface markers. Genetic and biochemical analysis in combination with data on cell surface markers help to differentiate this lymphoma from other small B cell lymphomas. See M. Piris et al. pp. 275 282 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

ALL is a marrow based neoplasm largely affecting children with the highest incidence between 1 5 years. Most common symptoms at presentation include fatigue lethargy fever and bone and joint pain. Fatigue and lethargy correlates with the degree of anemia present. An elevated white blood cell count is common at presentment. Radiographs of the chest often show skeletal lesions. Extramedullary spread is common and involves the central nervous system testes lymph nodes liver spleen and kidney. Anterior mediastinal masses are observed in only about 5 10 of newly diagnosed cases. See J. Whitlock et al. pp. 2241 2271 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

The immunophenotype of ALL is CD10 CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD24. Pre B cell ALL cells express cytoplasmic but not surface immunoglobulin while mature B cell ALL which accounts for only 1 2 of ALL cases is distinguished from other leukemias of B cell lineage by the expression of surface immunoglobulin. Cytogenetic characteristics of ALL includes t 8 14 t 2 8 and t 8 22 . Although rarely detected at the cytogenetic level t 12 21 may be the most common cytogenetic abnormality associated with childhood ALL observed in about 25 of cases . See M. Kinney et al. pp. 2209 2240 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 J Whitlock et al. pp. 2241 2271 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

Precise diagnosis of acute leukemia usually relies on a bone aspirate and biopsy. Aspirate smears are used for morphological immunological and cytological assessments. The demonstration of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow is diagnostic of ALL. The presence of greater than 5 leukemic lymphoblast cells in the bone marrow confirms ALL diagnosis but most require greater than 25 for a definitive diagnosis. Lumbar punctures are used to diagnose central nervous system involvement. Serum uric acids levels and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels have been found to be elevated in ALL. See M. Kinney et al. pp. 2209 2240 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 J. Whitlock et al pp. 2241 2271 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

CLL SLL is the most common type of leukemia. When the disease involves the peripheral blood and bone marrow it is referred to as CLL. However when the lymph nodes and other tissues are infiltrated by cells that are immunologically and morphologically identical to those in CLL but where leukemic characteristics of the disease are absent then the disease is referred to as SLL. This disease largely afflicts the elderly with a greater incidence of the disease occurring in men than women. Painless lymphadenopathy is the most common finding at presentation. Hypogammaglobulinemia is common with most cases of CLL SLL exhibiting reduced levels of all immunoglobulins rather than any particular subclass of immunoglobulins. Asymptomatic patients are frequently diagnosed during routine blood counts lymphocyte count of over 5000 10 L . As many as 20 of CLL SLL cases report B symptoms. An additional diagnostic feature is infiltration of the bone marrow by more than 30 by immature lymphocytes. Lymph node biopsies generally show infiltration of involved nodes with well differentiated lymphocytes. Autoimmune phenomena are often associated with CLL SLL including autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia. See J. Gribben et al. pp. 243 261 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 K. Maclennan pp. 43 47 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 A. Neal et al. Neal Hoskin and Oxford University Press co publ. New York N.Y. 2003 .

In contrast with many of the low grade B cell malignancies nonrandom reciprocal translocations are rarely found in CLL SLL. However other cytogenetic abnormalities have been reported including deletions at 13q14 11q22 23 and 17q13 with the latter two involving the p53 locus. Approximately 20 of cases exhibit trisomy 12. An elevated level of 13 2 microglobulin higher levels of CD38 expression and the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha are all characteristic of CLL SLL. The immunophenotype of CLL SLL is very diagnostic and includes weak expression of surface immunoglobulin usually IgM or IgM and IgG as well as expression of the cell antigens CD19 CD22 CD20 and usually CD5 and CD23. See J. Gribben et al. pp. 243 261 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 K. Maclennan pp. 43 47 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

PLL once considered a variant of CLL is now understood to be a distinct disease. PLL is generally a disease of elderly men and is characterized by a very high white blood cell count greater than 200 10 L and splenomegaly. Additional symptoms include anemia and thrombocytopenia. Prolymphocytes in PLL comprise more than 55 of the cells in the blood and bone marrow. In contrast with CLL autoimmune phenomena are rarely observed in PLL. See J. Gribben et al. pp. 243 261 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

The immunophenotype of PLL is characterized by expression of CD19 CD21 CD22 CD24 and FMC7. The cells of PLL do not express CD23 and most do not express CD5. PLL cells exhibit complex chromosomal abnormalities with deletions at 13q14 and 11q23 being some of the most frequent. The pattern of p53 mutation in PLL cells is different from that observed for CLL. Differential diagnosis usually relies on complete blood count histological immunophenotypic and genetic analyses. See J. Gribben et al. pp. 243 261 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

HCL is a rare indolent chronic leukemia affecting more men than women and largely those of middle age. The typical symptoms include massive splenomegaly and pancytopenia. The peripheral blood and bone marrow contain the typical hairy cells which are B lymphocytes with cytoplasmic projections. Over 90 of HCL patients have bone marrow infiltration. See A. Neal et al. Neal Hoskin and Oxford University Press co publ. New York N.Y. 2003 J. Johnston pp. 2428 2446 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

Cytogenetic analysis has shown that clonal abnormalities are present in 19 of cases and involve numerical and structural abnormalities of chromosomes 5 7 and 14. The serum level of TNF is elevated in hairy cell leukemia and correlates with tumor burden. Hairy cell leukemia cells express surface immunoglobulins IgG and IgM and CD11c CD19 CD20 CD22 and typically CD25. In addition FMC7 HC 2 and CD103 are expressed. HCL cells do not express CD5 or CD10. Diagnosis generally involves the use of bone marrow aspirates cytogenetics blood smears and immunophenotyping. See A. Neal et al. Neal Hoskin and Oxford University Press co publ. New York N.Y. 2003 J. Johnston pp. 2428 2446 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

5.22.2.12. Precursor B Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Pre B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Lymphoblastic Lymphoma

Precursor B cell lymphoblastic lymphoma pre B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a disease of precursor T or B cells. The T and B cell lymphoblastic lymphomas are morphologically identical but clinical distinctions may be made based on degree of bone marrow infiltration or bone marrow involvement. 85 90 of lymphoblastic lymphomas are T cell derived with the remainder being B cell derived. Lymphoblastic lymphoma has a median age of 20 years with a male predominance. Peripheral lymph node involvement is a common feature at presentation occurring especially in the cervical supraclavicular and axillary regions. This disease frequently presents with bone marrow involvement. Central nervous system is less common at presentment but often appears in cases of relapse. Other sites of involvement can include liver spleen bone skin pharynx and testes See J. Sweetenham et al. pp. 503 513 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Precursor B cell lymphoblastic lymphomas express immature markers B cell markers such as CD99 CD34 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. These cells also express CD79a CD19 CD22 and sometimes CD20 and typically lack expression of CD45 and surface immunoglobulin. Translocations at 11q23 as well as t 9 22 q34 q11.2 and t 12 21 p13 q22 have been associated with poor prognosis. Good prognosis is associated with hyperdiploid karyotype especially that associated with trisomy 4 10 and 17 and t 12 21 p13 q22 . See J. Sweetenham et al. pp. 503 513 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Diagnostic tests include lymph node biopsies blood tests x rays CT scans and lumbar punctures to examine the cerebralspinal fluid for malignant cells.

Primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma is a diffuse large B cell lymphoma occurring predominantly in young women and characterized by a locally invasive anterior mediastinal mass originating in the thymus. Distant spread to peripheral nodes and bone marrow involvement is unusual. Systemic symptoms are common. While this disease resembles nodal large cell lymphomas it has distinct genetic immunological and morphological characteristics.

The immunophenotype of tumor cells of primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma are often surface immunoglobulin negative but do express such B cell associated antigens as CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD79a. CD10 and BCL6 are also commonly expressed. Expression of plasma cell associated markers CD15 CD30 epithelial membrane antigen EMA is rare. BCL6 and c myc gene arrangements are also uncommon. The presence of clonal immunoglobulin rearrangements immunoglobulin variable region and gene hypermutation along with BCL6 hypermutation suggest that this lymphoma derives from a mature germinal center or post germinal center B cell. The chromosomal translocations that seem to be associated with tumors of this disease are similar to those observed in other forms of diffuse large cell lymphoma. See P. Zinzani et al. pp. 455 460 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

The diagnostic evaluation for primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma generally includes a complete physical examination complete hematological and biochemical analysis total body computerized tomography and bone marrow biopsy. Gallium 67 scanning is a useful test for staging response to treatment and for assessment of relapse. See P. Zinzani et al. pp. 455 460 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

5.22.2.14. Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma LPL Lymphoplasmacytic Immunocytoma Waldstr m s Macroglobulinemia

LPL Lymphoplasmacytic immunocytoma Waldstr m s Macroglobulinemia is a nodal lymphoma that is usually indolent and often involves bone marrow lymph nodes and spleen. This is generally a disease of older adults with males slightly predominating. Most patients have monoclonal IgM paraprotein in their serum 3 g dL resulting in hyperviscosity of the serum. Tumor cells have a plasmacytic morphology. A subset of LPL is characterized by recurrent translocations between chromosomes 9 and 14 which involves the PAX5 and immunoglobulin heavy chain loci. LPL is characterized by SHM as well as ongoing SHM and is believed to be derived from post GC B cells. See A. Rohatiner et al. pp. 263 273 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 K. Maclennan pp. 43 47 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 A. Lal et al. pp. 181 220 In W. Finn et al. eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 .

The immunophenotype of this disease shows expression of the B cell associated antigens CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD79a and a lack of expression of CD5 CD10 and CD23. Presence of strong surface immunoglobulin and CD20 the lack of expression of CD5 and CD23 and the presence of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin are characteristics that aid in distinguishing this disease from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Also diagnostic of this disease is t 9 14 p13 q32 . See A. Rohatiner et al. pp. 263 273 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 K. Maclennan pp. 43 47 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 R. Chaganti et al. pp. 809 824 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Diagnostic tests typically include a complete blood count renal and liver function tests CT scans biopsy and aspiration of the bone marrow protein electrophoresis to quantify and characterize the paraprotein and serum viscosity. Measurement of microglobulin is used as a prognostic test. See A. Rohatiner et al. pp. 263 273 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Null acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a subset of ALL which lacks B or T cell characteristics. Phenotypic analysis of leukemic blasts shows a typical null ALL pattern i.e. CD10 common ALL antigen negative strongly HLA DR positive and CD19 B4 positive see Katz et al. 1988 Blood 71 5 1438 47 .

Hodgkin s lymphoma usually arises in the lymph nodes of young adults. It can be divided into classical subtype and a less common nodular lymphocytic predominant subtype. The classical type exhibits SHM but not ongoing SHM and does not have a GC B cell gene expression profile. The nodular lymphocyte predominant type in contrast is characterized by SHM and ongoing SHM and a GC B cell gene expression profile. While the two types differ clinically and biologically they do share certain features such as a lack of neoplastic cells within a background of benign inflammatory cells. B. Schnitzer et al. pp. 259 290 In W. Finn and L. Peterson eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 .

The most common features at presentation are painless enlargement of lymph nodes usually in the neck but occasionally in the inguinal region. Waxing and waning of nodes is also characteristic of this disease. B symptoms are observed in about one third of patients. Isolated extranodal involvement is rare and in cases where dissemination has occurred extranodal involvement is observed about 10 20 of the time. See P. Johnson et al. pp. 181 204 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Reed Sternberg RS cells are the malignant cells of Hodgkin s lymphoma. RS cells and their variants express CD15 CD25 CD30 and transferrin receptor. In addition these cells express polyclonal cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. In most cases of Hodgkin s lymphoma the RS cells do not express CD45 a feature that aids in distinguishing this disease from non Hodgkin s Lymphomas. Epstein Barr virus has been demonstrated to be present in Reed Sternberg cells in about one half of Hodgkin s lymphoma cases but its role is unclear.

Diagnosis is most frequently made by lymph node biopsy. Additional diagnostic tests include a full blood count often hematological tests are normal white blood cell counts of less than 1.0 10 L are seen in about 20 of cases erythrocyte sedimentation rate often elevated in advanced stages of the disease biochemical tests including electrolytes urea creatinine urate calcium hypercalcemia is rare but when present is associated with extensive bone involvement liver blood tests lactate dehydrogenase elevated levels often associated with advanced disease albumin and beta microglobulin 2 M . Lymphanigiograms and chest x rays and CT scans of the chest abdomen and pelvis are important in identifying abnormal lymph nodes and the extent of extranodal involvement. Bone marrow biopsies are typically considered optional as bone marrow involvement is unusual and the results of such biopsies appear not to affect clinical management or prognosis. Splenechtomies are not usually performed today as it rarely influences management and CT or MRI imaging provides information on splenic status. Significantly elevated levels of p55 TNF and sICAM 1 are correlated to the stage of the disease presence of symptoms and complete response rate. See P. Johnson et al. 181 204 B. Hancock et al eds.

Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells. Neoplastic cells are located in the bone marrow and osteolytic bone lesions are characteristic. Reciprocal chromosomal translocations between one of the immunoglobulin loci and a variety of other genes e.g. cyclin D1 cyclin D3 c MAF MMSET multiple myeloma SET domain protein or fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 are believed to be the primary oncogenic events. Multiple myeloma is characterized by SHM and the putative cell of origin is a post GC B cell. Multiple myeloma is typically first identified by symptoms such as recurrent infection fatigue pain and kidney problems and is confirmed with clinical testing see for example 6th edition. DeVita V. T. Hellman S and Rosenberg S. A. editors. 2001 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 19106 pp. 2465 2499 .

In certain embodiments patients who are candidates for treatment by compositions and methods of the invention can undergo further diagnostic tests on blood and or urine to confirm the diagnosis or suspicion of multiple myeloma including but not limited to complete blood count CBC tests to determine if the types of cells reported in a CBC are within their normal ranges which are well known in the art blood chemistry profile to determine whether levels of various blood components such as albumin blood urea nitrogen BUN calcium creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase LDH deviate from standard values. Serum levels of beta microglobulin M can also be examined and surrogate markers for IL 6 a growth factor for myeloma cells. Urinalysis can be used to measure the levels of protein in the urine. Electrophoresis can be used to measure the levels of various proteins including M protein in the blood called serum protein electrophoresis or SPEP or urine called urine electrophoresis or UEP . An additional test called immunofixation electrophoresis IFE or immunoelectrophoresis may also be performed to provide more specific information about the type of abnormal antibody proteins present. Assessing changes and proportions of various proteins particularly M protein can be used to track the progression of myeloma disease and response to treatment regimens. Multiple myeloma is characterized by a large increase in M protein which is secreted by the myeloma tumor cells.

Diagnostic tests on bone can also be conducted to confirm the diagnosis or suspicion of multiple myeloma including but not limited to X rays and other imaging tests including a bone skeletal survey magnetic resonance imaging MRI and computerized axial tomography CAT also known as computed tomography CT can assess changes in the bone structure and determine the number and size of tumors in the bone. Bone marrow aspiration or bone marrow biopsy can be used to detect an increase in the number of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Aspiration requires a sample of liquid bone marrow and biopsy requires a sample of solid bone tissue. In both tests samples can be taken from the pelvis hip bone . The sternum breast bone can also be used for aspiration of bone marrow.

Patients with multiple myeloma are typically categorized into the following three groups that help define effective treatment regimens. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance MGUS is typically characterized by a serum M protein level of less than 3 g dL bone marrow clonal plasma cells of less than 10 no evidence of other B cell disorders and no related organ or tissue impairment such as hypercalcemia increased serum calcium levels impaired kidney function noted by increased serum creatinine anemia or bone lesions. Asymptomatic myelomas are typically stage I and includes smoldering multiple myeloma SMM and indolent multiple myeloma IMM . SMM is characterized by serum M protein greater than or equal to 3 g dL and IMM is characterized by bone marrow clonal plasma cells greater than or equal to 10 of the bone marrow cells. Symptomatic myeloma is characterized by M protein in serum and or urine and includes Stage II multiple myeloma characterized by the presence of bone marrow clonal plasma cells or plasmacytoma and Stage III multiple myeloma characterized by related organ or tissue impairment.

Osteosclerotic myeloma is a component of the rare POEMS syndrome polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal gammopathy and skin lesions . Peak incidence is at 40 to 50 years of age. Systemic features include skeletal lesions marrow plasma cells 

Smoldering multiple myeloma patients generally present with stable disease for months years no anemia bone lesions renal insufficiency or hypercalcemia have 10 plasma cells in bone marrow and monoclonal serum protein. The criteria for smoldering multiple myeloma is compatible with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma however there is no evidence of progressive course. These are cases with a slow progression the tumor cell mass is low at diagnosis and the percentage of bone marrow plasma cells in S phase is low 3 g dL and or bone marrow plasma cells 10 absence of anemia renal failure hypercalcemia lytic bone lesions.

Indolent or asymptomatic multiple myeloma is a multiple myeloma diagnosed by chance in the absence of symptoms usually after screening laboratory studies. Indolent multiple myeloma is similar to smoldering myeloma but with few bone lesions and mild anemia. Most cases of indolent multiple myeloma develop overt multiple myeloma within 3 years. Diagnostic criteria are the same as for multiple myeloma except no bone lesions or one asymptomatic lytic lesion X ray survey M component level 

Solitary plasmacytoma is one of a spectrum of plasma cell neoplasms which range from benign monoclonal gammopathy to solitary plasmacytoma to multiple myeloma. Approximately seventy percent of all solitary plasmacytoma cases eventually result in multiple myeloma. These diseases are characterized by a proliferation of B cells which produce the characteristic paraprotein. Solitary plasmacytoma results in a proliferation of clonal plasma cells in a solitary site usually a single bone or extramedullary tissue site. Diagnostic criteria of solitary plasmacytoma include a histologically confirmed single lesion normal bone biopsy negative skeletal survey no anemia normal calcium and renal function. Most cases exhibit minimally elevated serum M protein paraprotein . The median age at diagnosis is 50 55 about 5 10 years younger than the median age for multiple myeloma. See C. Wilson pp. 113 144 In W. Finn and L. Peterson eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 S. Chaganti et al. pp. 809 824 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

LCDD is a plasma cell dycrasias disorder caused by the over synthesis of immunoglobulin light chains usually kappa light chains that are deposited in tissues. Patients commonly present with organ dysfunction weakness fatigue and weight loss. In approximately 80 of cases of LCDD a monoclonal immunoglobulin is detected. Detection of monoclonal kappa light chains using immunofluorescent techniques is limited by the tendency of light chains to give excess background staining therefore ultrastructural immunogold labeling may be necessary. See C. Wilson pp. 113 144 In W. Finn and L. Peterson eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 .

PCL a plasma cell dycrasias is a rare aggressive variant of multiple myeloma. The criteria for plasma cell leukemia is a peripheral blood absolute plasma cell count of greater than 2 10 L or plasma cells greater than 20 of white blood cells. Determination of the presence of a CD138 population with cytoplasmic light chain restriction by flow cytometry will distinguish PCL from lymphoid neoplasm with plasmacytic features. PCL cells are also characterized by the lack of surface light chain CD19 and CD22 expression and either no or weak expression of CD45. About 50 of cases of PCL express CD20 and about 50 lack expression of CD56. The genetic abnormalities observed in PCL patients are the same as those observed for multiple myeloma patients but they are found at higher frequency in PCL. See C. Wilson pp. 113 144 In W. Finn and L. Peterson eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 .

Plasma cell leukemia has two forms if initial diagnosis is based on leukemic phase of myeloma then the primary form is present otherwise it is secondary. Primary plasma cell leukemia is associated with a younger age hepatosplenomegaly lymphadenopathy and fewer lytic bone lesions but poorer prognosis than the secondary form. The peripheral blood of plasma cell leukemic patients has greater than 20 plasma cells with absolute count of 2000 ml or more.

MGUS is a relatively common condition characterized by the presence of electrophoretically homogeneous immunoglobulins or benign M components. The occurrence of this condition appears to increase with age. Most individuals carrying the M components never develop malignant plasma cell dycrasias such as multiple myeloma. However some individuals with this condition have associated malignant conditions. When symptomatic patients can have enlarged liver or spleen and pleuroneuropathy. See J. Foerster pp. 2612 2630 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

MGUS can be differentiated from multiple myeloma by the presence of increased number of monoclonal plasma cells circulating in the peripheral blood. The serological characteristics of M components are identical to other plasma cell dycrasias conditions however the total concentration of M component is usually less than 30 g L. The paraprotein is usually IgG however multiple paraproteins may be present including IgG IgA IgM. The relative amount of each of the individual immunoglobulin classes is typically proportional to that found in normal serum. Proteinemia or proteinuria is rare. Serial measurements of M protein levels in the blood and urine and continued monitoring of the clinical and laboratory features including protein electrophoresis is the most reliable method of differentiating MGUS from early stage plasma cell dycrasias. Tenth Edition G. Lee et al eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

In a further embodiment the invention can be practiced to treat mature B cell malignancies including but not limited to follicular lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma Burkitt s lymphoma multiple myeloma diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL including germinal center B cell like GCB DLBCL activated B cell like ABC DLBCL and type 3 DLBCL Hodgkin s lymphoma including classical and nodular lymphocyte pre dominant type lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma LPL marginal zone lymphoma including gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL including immunoglobulin mutated CLL and immunoglobulin unmutated CLL.

Further CD19 is expressed earlier in B cell development than for example CD20 and is therefore particularly suited for treating pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies e.g. in the bone marrow. Representative pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies include but are not limited to mantle cell lymphoma pre B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia precursor B cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and other malignancies characterized by CD19 expression.

According to certain aspects of the invention the treatment regimen and dose used with compositions and methods of the invention is chosen based on a number of factors including for example clinical manifestation that place a patient at risk for developing a humoral rejection or clinical evidence that such a rejection is developing. The terms humoral and antibody mediated are used interchangeably herein.

The criteria for assessing the risk that a patient will develop a humoral rejection are established according to the knowledge and skill in the art. In one embodiment a positive complement dependent cytotoxicity or antiglobulin enhanced complement dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch indicates that a patient is at high risk for humoral rejection. In one embodiment a positive crossmatch or a prior positive complement dependent cytotoxicity or anti globulin enhanced complement dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch indicates that a patient is at an intermediate risk for humoral rejection. In one embodiment a negative crossmatch indicates that a patient is at a low risk for humoral rejection.

In another embodiment a transplant recipient in need of prophylaxis against graft rejection may be identified as a patient or patient population having detectable circulating anti HLA alloantibodies prior to transplantation. In another example the patient or patient population is identified as having panel reactive antibodies prior to transplantation. The presence of detectable circulating anti HLA alloantibodies in a transplant recipient post transplantation can also be used to identify the patient or patient population in need of treatment for humoral rejection according to the invention. The patient or patient population in need of treatment for humoral rejection can also be identified according to other clinical criteria that indicate that a transplant recipient is at risk for developing a humoral rejection or has already developed a humoral rejection. For example a transplant recipient in need of treatment of humoral rejection may be identified as a patient or population in an early stage of humoral rejection such as a latent humoral response characterized by circulating anti donor alloantibodies. An early stage of humoral rejection may also be a silent reaction characterized by circulating anti donor alloantibodies and C4d deposition or a subclinical rejection characterized by circulating anti donor alloantibodies C4d deposition and tissue pathology. In later stages the recipient is identified as a patient or patient population presenting with clinical indications of humoral rejection characterized according to the knowledge and skill in the art for example by circulating anti donor alloantibodies C4d deposition tissue pathology and graft dysfunction.

According to certain aspects of the invention the treatment regimen and dose used with compositions and methods of the invention is chosen based on a number of factors including but not limited to the stage of the autoimmune disease or disorder being treated. Appropriate treatment regimens can be determined by one of skill in the art for particular stages of an autoimmune disease or disorder in a patient or patient population. Dose response curves can be generated using standard protocols in the art in order to determine the effective amount of compositions of the invention for treating patients having different stages of a autoimmune disease or disorder. In general patients having more activity of a autoimmune disease or disorder will require higher doses and or more frequent doses which may be administered over longer periods of time in comparison to patients having less activity of an autoimmune disease or disorder.

Anti CD19 antibodies compositions and methods described herein may be practiced to treat an autoimmune disease or disorder. The term autoimmune disease or disorder refers to a condition in a subject characterized by cellular tissue and or organ injury caused by an immunologic reaction of the subject to its own cells tissues and or organs. The term inflammatory disease is used interchangeably with the term inflammatory disorder to refer to a condition in a subject characterized by inflammation including but not limited to chronic inflammation. Autoimmune disorders may or may not be associated with inflammation. Moreover inflammation may or may not be caused by an autoimmune disorder. Thus certain disorders may be characterized as both autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Exemplary autoimmune diseases or disorders include but are not limited to alopecia greata ankylosing spondylitis antiphospholipid syndrome autoimmune Addison s disease autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis autoimmune thrombocytopenia Behcet s disease bullous pemphigoid cardiomyopathy celiac sprue dermatitis chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome CFIDS chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Churg Strauss syndrome cicatrical pemphigoid CREST syndrome cold agglutinin disease Crohn s disease discoid lupus essential mixed cryoglobulinemia diabetes eosinophilic fascites fibromyalgia fibromyositis glomerulonephritis Graves disease Guillain Barre Hashimoto s thyroiditis Henoch Sch nlein purpura idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura ITP IgA neuropathy juvenile arthritis lichen planus lupus erthematosus M ni re s disease mixed connective tissue disease multiple sclerosis type 1 or immune mediated diabetes mellitus myasthenia gravis pemphigus related disorders e.g. pemphigus vulgaris pernicious anemia polyarteritis nodosa polychrondritis polyglandular syndromes polymyalgia rheumatica polymyositis and dermatomyositis primary agammaglobulinemia primary biliary cirrhosis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis Raynauld s phenomenon Reiter s syndrome Rheumatoid arthritis sarcoidosis scleroderma Sj gren s syndrome stiff man syndrome systemic lupus erythematosis SLE Sweet s syndrome Still s disease lupus erythematosus takayasu arteritis temporal arteristis giant cell arteritis ulcerative colitis uveitis vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis vitiligo and Wegener s granulomatosis. Examples of inflammatory disorders include but are not limited to asthma encephilitis inflammatory bowel disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD allergic disorders septic shock pulmonary fibrosis undifferentitated spondyloarthropathy undifferentiated arthropathy arthritis inflammatory osteolysis graft versus host disease urticaria Vogt Koyanagi Hareda syndrome and chronic inflammation resulting from chronic viral or bacteria infections.

Anti CD19 immunotherapy encompasses the administration of an anti CD19 antibody as a single agent therapeutic for the treatment of an autoimmune disease or disorder. In one embodiment an anti CD19 immunotherapy of the invention encompasses the administration of an anti CD19 antibody capable of inhibiting in vitro stimulated B cell proliferation. In another embodiment an anti CD19 immunotherapy of the invention encompasses the administration of an Fc variant anti CD19 antibody wherein said Fc variant has altered binding affinity to one or more Fc ligand relative to a comparable non variant molecule. In a specific embodiment an anti CD19 immunotherapy of the invention encompasses the administration of an Fc variant anti CD19 antibody wherein said Fc variant has enhanced binding to Fc gamma receptor IIB relative to a comparable non variant Fc domain.

Anti CD19 immunotherapy further encompasses the administration of an anti CD19 bispecific antibody as a single agent therapeutic for the treatment of an autoimmune disease or disorder. In one embodiment an anti CD19 immunotherapy of the invention encompasses the administration of an anti CD19 bispecific antibody capable to specifically bind to a first and second antigen wherein said first antigen is human CD19 and said second antigen is an Fc gamma receptor selected from the group consisting of Fc RI Fc RIIA Fc RIIB Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIV. In a further embodiment an anti CD19 immunotherapy of the invention encompasses the administration of an anti CD19 bispecific antibody capable of specifically binding to human CD19 and Fc RIIB.

CD19 is expressed on immature B cells therefore an anti CD19 mAb may be particularly suited for depleting pre B cells and immature B cells e.g in the bone marrow.

The diagnosis of an autoimmune disease or disorder is complicated in that each type of autoimmune disease or disorder manifests differently among patients. This heterogeneity of symptoms means that multiple factors are typically used to arrive at a clinical diagnosis. Generally clinicians use factors such as but not limited to the presence of autoantibodies elevated cytokine levels specific organ dysfunction skin rashes joint swelling pain bone remodeling and or loss of movement as primarily indicators of an autoimmune disease or disorder. For certain autoimmune diseases or disorders such as RA and SLE standards for diagnosis are known in the art. For certain autoimmune diseases or disorders stages of disease have been characterized and are well known in the art. These art recognized methods for diagnosing autoimmune diseases and disorders as well as stages of disease and scales of activity and or severity of disease that are well known in the art can be used to identify patients and patient populations in need of treatment for an autoimmune disease or disorder using compositions and methods of the invention.

Diagnostic criteria for different autoimmune diseases or disorders are known in the art. Historically diagnosis is typically based on a combination of physical symptoms. More recently molecular techniques such as gene expression profiling have been applied to develop molecular definitions of autoimmune diseases or disorders. Exemplary methods for clinical diagnosis of particular autoimmune diseases or disorders are provided below. Other suitable methods will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

In certain embodiments patients with low levels of autoimmune disease activity or patients with an early stage of an autoimmune disease for diseases where stages are recognized can be identified for treatment using anti CD19 antibody compositions and methods. The early diagnosis of autoimmune disease is difficult due to the general symptoms and overlap of symptoms among diseases. In such embodiments a patient treated at an early stage or with low levels of an autoimmune disease activity has symptoms comprising at least one symptom of an autoimmune disease or disorder. In related embodiments a patient treated at an early stage or with low levels of an autoimmune disease has symptoms comprising at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 or 15 symptoms of an autoimmune disease or disorder. The symptoms may be of any autoimmune diseases and disorders or a combination thereof. Examples of autoimmune disease and disorder symptoms are described below.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease mainly characterized by inflammation of the lining or synovium of the joints. It can lead to long term joint damage resulting in chronic pain loss of function and disability. Identifying patients or patient populations in need of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is a process. There is no definitive test that provides a positive or negative diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Clinicians rely on a number of tools including medical histories physical exams lab tests and X rays.

Physical symptoms vary widely among patients and commonly include but are not limited to joint swelling joint tenderness loss of motion in joints joint malalignment bone remodeling fatigue stiffness particularly in the morning and when sitting for long periods of time weakness flu like symptoms including a low grade fever pain associated with prolonged sitting the occurrence of flares of disease activity followed by remission or disease inactivity rheumatoid nodules or lumps of tissue under the skin typically found on the elbows they can indicate more severe disease activity muscle pain loss of appetite depression weight loss anemia cold and or sweaty hands and feet and involvement of the glands around the eyes and mouth causing decreased production of tears and saliva Sj gren s syndrome . For Sjogren s specifically the following references may be used Fox et al. Arthritis Rheum. 1986 29 577 586 and Vitali et al. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2002 . 61 554 558.

Apart form physical symptoms clinicians commonly use tests such as but not limited to complete blood count erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR or sed rate C reactive protein rheumatoid factor anti DNA antibodies antinuclear antibodies ANA anti cardiolipin antibodies imaging studies radiographs X rays magnetic resonance imaging MRI of joints or organs joint ultrasound bone scans and bone densitometry DEXA . These tests are examples of tests that can be used in conjunction with compositions and methods of the invention to check for abnormalities that might exist i.e. identify patients or patient populations in need of treatment or to monitor side effects of drugs and check progress.

Early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis commonly are found in the smaller joints of the fingers hands and wrists. Joint involvement is usually symmetrical meaning that if a joint hurts on the left hand the same joint will hurt on the right hand. In general more joint erosion indicates more severe disease activity.

Symptoms of more advanced disease activity include damage to cartilage tendons ligaments and bone which causes deformity and instability in the joints. The damage can lead to limited range of motion resulting in daily tasks grasping a fork combing hair buttoning a shirt becoming more difficult. Skin ulcers greater susceptibility to infection and a general decline in health are also indicators of more advanced disease activity.

Progression of rheumatoid arthritis is commonly divided into three stages. The first stage is the swelling of the synovial lining causing pain warmth stiffness redness and swelling around the joint. Second is the rapid division and growth of cells or pannus which causes the synovium to thicken. In the third stage the inflamed cells release enzymes that may digest bone and cartilage often causing the involved joint to lose its shape and alignment more pain and loss of movement.

Molecular techniques can also be used to identify patients or patient populations in need of treatment. For example rheumatoid arthritis has been shown to be associated with allelic polymorphisms of the human leukocyte antigen HLA DR4 and HLA DRB1 genes Ollier and Winchester 1999 Genes and Genetics of Autoimmunity. Basel Switzerland Stastny 1978 N. Engl J Med 298 869 871 and Gregersen et al. 1987 Arthritis Rheum 30 1205 1213 . Rheumatoid arthritis patients frequently express two disease associated HLA DRB1 04 alleles Weyand et al. 1992 Ann Intern Med 117 801 806 . Patients can be tested for allelic polymorphisms using methods standard in the art. MHC genes are not the only germline encoded genes influencing susceptibility to RA that can be used to diagnose or identify patients or patient populations in need of treatment. Female sex clearly increases the risk and female patients develop a different phenotype of the disease than do male patients. Any molecular indicators of rheumatoid arthritis can be used to identify patients or patient populations in need of treatment with an anti CD19 antibody composition or method.

Methods for determining activity of rheumatoid arthritis in a patient in relation to a scale of activity are well known in the art and can be used in connection with pharmaceutical compositions and methods of the invention. For example the American College of Rheumatologists Score ACR score can be used to determine the activity of rheumatoid arthritis of a patient or a patient population. According to this method patients are given a score that correlates to improvement. For example patients with a 20 improvement in factors defined by the ACR would be given an ACR20 score.

Initially a patient exhibiting the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may be treated with an analgesic. In other embodiments a patient diagnosed with or exhibiting the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis is initially treated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory NSAID compounds. As the disease progresses and or the symptoms increase in severity rheumatoid arthritis may be treated by the administration of steroids such as but not limited to dexamethasone and prednisone. In more severe cases a chemotherapeutic agent such as but not limited to methotrexate or cytoxin may be administered to relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

In certain instances rheumatoid arthritis may be treated by administration of gold while in other instances a biologic such as an antibody or a receptor or receptor analog may be administered. Examples of such therapeutic antibodies are Rituxin and Remicade. An illustrative example of a soluble receptor that can be administered to treat rheumatoid arthritis is Enbrel.

In extremely severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis surgery may be indicated. Surgical approaches may include but not be limited to synovectomy to reduce the amount of inflammatory tissue by removing the diseased synovium or lining of the joint arthroscopic surgery to take tissue samples remove loose cartilage repair tears smooth a rough surface or remove diseased synovial tissue osteotomy meaning to cut bone this procedure is used to increase stability by redistributing the weight on the joint joint replacement surgery or arthroplasty for the surgical reconstruction or replacement of a joint or arthrodesis or fusion to fuse two bones together.

In certain embodiments of the methods of invention a patient can be treated with an anti CD19 antibody prior concurrent or subsequent to any of the therapies disclosed above. Moreover anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention may be administered in combination with any of the analgesic NSAID steroid or chemotherapeutic agents noted above as well as in combination with a biologic administered for the tretment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Systemic lupus erythematosis SLE is a chronic long lasting rheumatic disease which affects joints muscles and other parts of the body. Patients or patient populations in need of treatment for SLE can be identified by examining physical symptoms and or laboraotry test results. Physical symptoms vary widely among patients. For example in SLE typically 4 of the following 11 symptoms exist before a patient is diagnosed with SLE 1 malar rash rash over the cheeks 2 discoid rash red raised patches 3 photosensitivity reaction to sunlight resulting in the development of or increase in skin rash 4 oral ulcers ulcers in the nose or mouth usually painless 5 arthritis nonerosive arthritis involving two or more peripheral joints arthritis in which the bones around the joints do not become destroyed 6 serositis pleuritis or pericarditis inflammation of the lining of the lung or heart 7 renal disorder excessive protein in the urine greater than 0.5 gm day or 3 on test sticks and or cellular casts abnormal elements the urine derived from red and or white cells and or kidney tubule cells 8 neurologic disorder seizures convulsions and or psychosis in the absence of drugs or metabolic disturbances which are known to cause such effects 9 hematologic disorder hemolytic anemia or leukopenia white blood count below 4 000 cells per cubic millimeter or lymphopenia less than 1 500 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter or thrombocytopenia less than 100 000 platelets per cubic millimeter The leukopenia and lymphopenia must be detected on two or more occasions. The thrombocytopenia must be detected in the absence of drugs known to induce it 10 antinuclear antibody positive test for antinuclear antibodies ana in the absence of drugs known to induce it and or 11 immunologic disorder positive anti double stranded anti DNA test positive anti sm test positive antiphospholipid antibody such as anticardiolipin or false positive syphilis test vdrl .

Other physical symptoms that may be indicative of SLE include but are not limited to anemia fatigue fever skin rash muscle aches nausea vomiting and diarrhea swollen glands lack of appetite sensitivity to cold Raynaud s phenomenon and weight loss.

Laboratory tests can also be used to identify patients or patient populations in need of treatment. For example a blood test can be used to detect a autoantibodies found in the blood of almost all people with SLE. Such tests may include but are not limited to tests for antinuclear antibodies ANA in the absence of drugs known to induce it Rahman A. and Hiepe F. . 2002 . 11 12 770 773 anti double stranded anti DNA Keren D. F. . 2002 22 2 447 474. anti Sm antiphospholipid antibody such as anticardiolipin Gezer S. 2003. 49 12 696 741 or false positive syphilis tests VDRL .

Other tests may include a complement test C3 C4 CH50 CH100 can be used to measure the amount of complement proteins circulating in the blood Manzi et al. 2004. 13 5 298 303 a sedimentation rate ESR or C reactive protein CRP may be used to measure inflammation levels a urine analysis can be used to detect kidney problems chest X rays may be taken to detect lung damage and an EKG can be used to detect heart problems.

Chronic SLE is associated with accumulating collateral damage to involved organ particuarly the kidney. Accordingly early therapeutic intervention is desirable i.e. prior to for example kidney failure. Available treatments for SLE are similar to those available for rheumatoid arthritis. These include initial treatments either with an analgesic or a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory NSAID compound. As the disease progresses and or the symptoms increase in severity SLE may be treated by the administration of steroids such as but not limited to dexamethasone and prednisone.

In more severe cases a chemotherapeutic agent such as but not limited to methotrexate or cytoxin may be administered to relieve the symptoms of SLE. However this approach is not preferred where the patient is a female of child bearing age. In such instances those therapeutic approaches that do not interfere with the reproductive capacity of the patient are preferred.

In certain instances SLE may be treated by administration of a biologic such as an antibody or a receptor or receptor analog . Examples of such therapeutic antibodies are Rituxin and Remicade. An illustrative example of a soluble receptor for an inflammatory cytokine that can be administered to treat SLE is Enbrel.

In certain embodiments of the methods of invention a patient can be treated with an anti CD19 antibody prior concurrent or subsequent to any of the therapies disclosed above that are used for the treatment of SLE. Moreover anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention may be administered in combination with any of the analgesic NSAID steroid or chemotherapeutic agents noted above as well as in combination with a biologic administered for the tretment of SLE.

Idiopathic autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura ITP is a disorder of the blood characterized by immunoglobulin G IgG autoantibodies that interact with platelet cells and result in the destruction of those platelet cells. Typically the antibodies are specific to platelet membrane glycoproteins. The disorder may be acute temporary lasting less than 2 months or chronic persisting for longer than 6 months . Patients or patient populations in need of treatment for ITP can be identified by examining a patient s medical history physical symptoms and or laboratory test results. Provan D. and Newland A. . 2002 118 4 933 944 George J. N. . 2003 2 5 381 387 Karptkin S. . 2004 37 4 363 368 Cines D. B. and Blanchette V. S. . 2002 346 13 995 1008 .

Physical symptoms include purplish looking areas of the skin and mucous membranes such as the lining of the mouth where bleeding has occurred as a result of a decrease in the number of platelet cells. The main symptom is bleeding which can include bruising ecchymosis and tiny red dots on the skin or mucous membranes petechiae . In some instances bleeding from the nose gums digestive or urinary tracts may also occur. Rarely bleeding within the brain occurs. Common signs symptoms and precipitating factors also include but are not limited to abrupt onset childhood ITP gradual onset adult ITP nonpalpable petechiae purpura menorrhagia epistaxis gingival bleeding hemorrhagic bullae on mucous membranes signs of GI bleeding menometrorrhagia evidence of intracranial hemorrhage nonpalpable spleen retinal hemorrhages recent live virus immunization childhood ITP recent viral illness childhood ITP spontaneous bleeding when platelet count is less than 20 000 mm and bruising tendency.

Laboratory test that can be used to diagnose ITP include but are not limited to a complete blood count test or a bone marrow examination to verify that there are adequate platelet forming cells megakaryocyte in the marrow and to rule out other diseases such as metastatic cancer and leukemia. Isolated thrombocytopenia is the key finding regarding laboratory evaluation. Giant platelets on peripheral smear are indicative of congenital thrombocytopenia. A CT scan of the head may be warranted if concern exists regarding intracranial hemorrhage.

The current treatments for ITP include platelet transfusions and splenectomy. Other treatments include the administration of glucocorticoids administration of immunosuppressive agents administration of agents that enhance platelet production such as IL 11 and agents that activate megakaryocytes to produce platelets such as thrombopoietin TPO .

In more severe cases a chemotherapeutic agent such as but not limited to vincristine and vinblastine may be administered to relieve the symptoms of ITP. However this approach is not preferred where the patient is a female of child bearing age. In such instances those therapeutic approaches that do not interfere with the reproductive capacity of the patient are preferred.

In certain instances ITP may be treated by administration of a biologic such as an antibody or a receptor or receptor analog . Examples of such therapeutic antibodies are anti CD20 antibodies such as Rituximab.

In certain embodiments of the methods of invention a patient can be treated with an anti CD19 antibody prior concurrent or subsequent to any of the therapies disclosed above that are used for the treatment of ITP. Moreover anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention may be administered in combination with any of the agents noted above as well as in combination with a biologic administered for the tretment of ITP.

Both pemphigus and pemphigoid related disorders are a heterogenous group of autoimmune diseases characterized by a blistering condition of the skin and or mucosal surfaces. In both diseases the blistering is caused by autoimmune antibodies that recognize various proteins expressed on the surface of epithelial cells in the dermis and or epidermis.

In patients with pemphigus related disease the blistering occurs within the epidermis and is due to the binding of autoantibodies specific for desmoglein 1 Dsg1 and or desmoglein 3 Dsg3 . The classic subtypes of pemphigus can be distinguished according to anti desmoglein antibody specificities. Patients with pemphigus foliaceus PF produce anti Dsg1 antibodies only. Patients with pemphigus vulgaris PV and paraneoplastic pemphigus PNP produce anti Dsg3 antibodies if their lesions are restricted to mucosal tissues. In contrast PV and PNP patients with lesions of the skin and mucosa produce both anti Dsg1 and Dsg3 autoantibodies. Nagasaka T. et al. 2004. 114 1484 1492 Seishema M. et al. 2004. 140 12 1500 1503 Amagai M. 1999. 20 2 92 102 

In patients with pemphigoid related disease including but not limited to bulous phemphigoid urticarial bulous pemphigoid cicatricial pemphigoid epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and Linear IgA bullous dermatosis the blistering occurs at the interface of the dermis with the epidermis. The most common form of pemphigoid disease is bulous pemphigoid BP which is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that bind the bullous pemphigoid antigen 180 BP180 bullous pemphigoid antigen 230 BP230 laminin 5 and or beta 4 integrin. Fontao L. et al. 2003 14 5 1978 1992 Challacombe S. J. et al . 2001 . 59 4 226 234. 

Patients or patient populations in need of treatment for pemphigus or pemphigoid related disorders can be identified by examining a patient s medical history physical symptoms and or laboraotry test results reviewed in Mutasim D. F. . 2003 .20 9 663 681 Yeh S. W. et al. . 2003 . 16 3 214 223 Rosenkrantz W. S. 15 2 90 98 .

Typically diagnosis of these pemphigus or pemphigoid related disorders is made by skin biopsy. The biopsy skin sample is examined microscopically to determine the anatomical site of the blister e.g. epidermis or between dermis and epidermis . These findings are correlated with direct or indirect immunohistochemical analyses to detect the presence of autoantibodies at the site of the lesion. Serum samples from patients may also be examined for the presence of circulating autoantibodies using an ELISA based test for specific proteins. Several ELISA based assays have been described for detection of desmoglein antibodies in human samples Hashimoto T. . 2003 295 Suppl. 1 S2 11 . The presence of these desmoglein autoantibodies in biopsy samples is diagnistic of pemphigus.

Clinically pemphigus vulgaris can be diagnosed by the presence of blisters in the mouth. Inflammation or erosions may also be present in the lining of the eye and eyelids and the membranes of the nose or genital tract. Half of the patients also develop blisters or erosions of the skin often in the groin underarm face scalp and chest areas. Pemphigus foliaceus is a superficial relatively mild form of pemphigus. It usually manifests on the face and scalp but also involves the back and chest. Lesions do not occur in the mouth. The blisters are more confined to the outermost surface and often itch. Paraneoplastic pemphigus is very rare and generally occurs in people who have cancer. The lesions are painful and affect the mouth lips and esophagus swallowing tube as well as the skin. Due to involvement of the airways signs of respiratory disease may occur and can be life threatening.

The current treatments for pemphigus or pemphigoid related disease includes the topical administration of creams and ointments to alleviate the discomfort associated with the skin condition the administration of anti inflammatory agents or the administration of immunosuppressive agents.

In certain embodiments of the methods of invention a patient can be treated with an anti CD19 antibody prior concurrent or subsequent to any of the therapies disclosed above that are used for the treatment of pemphigoid or pemphigoid related disease. Moreover anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention may be administered in combination with any of the agents noted above.

According to certain aspects of the invention a patient in need of treatment for autoimmune diabetes also known as type 1A diabetes can be treated with anti CD19 antibody compositions and methods. Type 1A diabetes is an autoimmune disease caused by the synergistic effects of genetic environmental and immunologic factors that ultimately destroy the pancreatic beta cells. The consequences of pancreatic beta cell destruction are a decrease in beta cell mass a reduced insulin production secretion and a gradual rise in blood glucose levels.

Patients or patient populations in need of treatment for type 1A diabetes can be identified by examining a patient s medical history physical symptoms and or laboratory test results. Symptoms often come on suddenly and include but are not limited to low or non existent blood insulin levels increased thirst increased urination constant hunger weight loss blurred vision and or fatigue. Overt diabetes does not usually become evident until a majority of beta cells are destroyed 80 . Typically diabetes is clinically diagnosed if a patient has a random without regard to time since last meal blood glucose concentration 11.1 mmol L 200 mg dL and or a fasting no caloric intake for at least 8 hours plasma glucose 7.0 mmol L 126 mg dl and or a two hour plasma glucose 11.1 mmol L 200 mg dL . Ideally these tests should be repeated on different days with comparable results before diagnosis is confirmed. Harrison s Principles of Internal Medicine 16ed. editors Dennis L. Kasper et al.

Although the precise etiology of type 1A diabetes is unknown there exists clear genetic linkage to specific HLA serotypes. In particular autoimmune diabetes is associated with HLA DR3 and DR4 serotypes. The presence of both DR3 and DR4 confers the highest known genetic risk. Susceptibility to autoimmune diabetes is also linked to HLA class II HLA DQB1 0302. In contrast HLA haplotypes with DRB1 1501 and DQA1 0102 DQB1 0602 are associated with protection from type 1A diabetes Redondo M. J. et al. 2000 10 3793 3797.

In certain embodiments of the methods of invention a patient can be treated with an anti CD19 antibody prior concurrent or subsequent to any of the therapies disclosed above that are used for the treatment of autoimmune diabetes. Moreover anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention may be administered in combination with any of the agents noted above.

Systemic sclerosis also known as Scleroderma encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases including but not limited to Limited cutaneous disease Diffuse cutaneous disease Sine scleroderma Undifferentiated connective tissue disease Overlap syndromes Localized scleroderma Morphea Linear scleroderma En coup de saber Scleredema adultorum of Buschke Scleromyxedema Chronic graft vs. host disease Eosinophilic fasciitis Digital sclerosis in diabetes and Primary anylooidosisand anyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma. Reviewed in Harrison s Principles of Internal Medicine 16ed. editors Dennis L. Kasper et al. The McGraw Hill Companies Inc. 2005 New York N.Y. .

Clinical features associated with scleroderma can include Raynaud s phenomenon skin thickening subcutaneious calcinosis telangiectasia arthralgias arthritis myopathy esophageal dysmotility pulmonary fibrosis isolated pulmonary arterial hypertension congestive heart failure and renal crisis. The extent to which an patient displays one or more of these disease manifestations can influence the diagnosis and potential treatment plan.

Autoantibodies include Anti topioisomerase 1 anticentromere anti RNA polymerase I II and or III anti Th RNP anti U RNP anti fibrillarin anti PM Sci anti nuclear antibodies ANA .

Identification of patients and patient populations in need of treatment of scleroderma can be based on clinical history and physical findings. Patients or patient populations in need of treatment for scleroderma can be identified by examining a patient s medical history physical symptoms and or laboraotry test results. Diagnosis may be delayed in patients without significant skin thickening. Laboratory X ray pulmonary function tests and skin or renal kidney biopsies can be used to determine the extent and severity of internal organ involvement.

In the early months or years of disease onset scleroderma may resemble many other connective tissue diseases such as but not limited to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Polymyositis and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

The most classic symptom of systemic sclerosis scleroderma is sclerodactyl . Initial symptoms include swollen hands which sometimes progress to this tapering and claw like deformity. Not everyone with scleroderma develops this degree of skin hardening. Other symptoms can include morphea linear sclerodactyly hardened fingers Raynaud s syndrome calcinosis and telangiectasia.

Blood tests such as antinuclear antibody ANA tests can be used in the diagnosis of both localized and systemic scleroderma. For example anti centromere antibodies ACA and anti Scl 70 antibodies are indicative of patients in need of treatment for systemic sclerosis Ho et al. 2003 Arthritis Res Ther. 5 80 93 anti topo II alpha antibody are indicative of patients in need of treatment for local scleroderma and anti topo I alpha antibody are indicative of patients in need of treatment for systemic scleroderma. Several types of scleroderma and methods for diagnosing these types are recognized and well known in the art including but not limited to juvenile scleroderma Foeldvari Curr Opin Rheumatol 14 699 703 2002 Cefle et al. Int J Clin Pract. 58 635 638 2004 localized scleroderma Nodular Scleroderma Cannick J Rheumatol. 30 2500 2502 2003 and Systemic scleroderma including but not limited to Calcinosis Raynaud s Esophagus Sclerodactyl and Telangiectasia CREST limited systemic scleroderma and diffuse systemic scleroderma. Systemic scleroderma is also known as systemic sclerosis SSc . It may also be referred to as Progressive Systemic Sclerosis PSSc or Familial Progressive Systemic Sclerosis FPSSc Nadashkevich et al. Med Sci Monit. 10 CR615 621 2004 Frances et al. Rev Prat. 52 1884 90 2002 . Systemic sclerosis is a multisystem disorder characterized by the presence of connective tissue sclerosis vascular abnormalities concerning small sized arteries and the microcirculation and autoimmune changes.

The type of systemic scleroderma known as CREST is not characterized by any skin tightening. CREST is characterized by Calcinosis calcium deposits usually in the fingers Raynaud s loss of muscle control of the Esophagus which can cause difficulty swallowing Sclerodactyl a tapering deformity of the bones of the fingers and Telangiectasia small red spots on the skin of the fingers face or inside of the mouth. Typically two of these symptoms is sufficient for diagnosis of CREST. CREST may occur alone or in combination with any other form of Scleroderma or with other autoimmune diseases.

Limited Scleroderma is characterized by tight skin limited to the fingers along with either pitting digital ulcers secondary to Raynaud s and or lung fibrosis. The skin of the face and neck may also be involved in limited scleroderma.

Diffuse Scleroderma is diagnosed whenever there is proximal tight skin. Proximal means located closest to the reference point. Proximal tight skin can be skin tightness above the wrists or above the elbows. Typically a patient with skin tightness only between their elbows and their wrists will receive a diagnosis of either diffuse or limited systemic Scleroderma depending on which meaning of proximal the diagnosing clinician uses.

The current therpaies for scleroderma include extracorporeal photophoresis following 6 methoxypsoralen and autologous stem cell transplant 

The current treatments for scleroderma include the administration of the following agents penicillamine cholchicine interferon alpha interpheron gamma chlorambucil cyclosporine 5 fluorouracil cyclophosphamide minocycline thalidomide etanercept or methotrexate.

In certain embodiments of the methods of invention a patient can be treated with an anti CD19 antibody prior concurrent or subsequent to any of the therapies disclosed above that are used for the treatment of autoimmune diabetes. Moreover anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention may be administered in combination with any of the agents noted above.

While not required assays for CD19 density can be employed to further characterize the patient s diagnosis. Methods of determining the density of antibody binding to cells are known to those skilled in the art See e.g. Sato et al. 165 6635 6643 2000 which discloses a method of assessing cell surface density of specific CD antigens . Other standard methods include Scatchard analysis. For example the antibody or fragment can be isolated radiolabeled and the specific activity of the radiolabeled antibody determined. The antibody is then contacted with a target cell expressing CD19. The radioactivity associated with the cell can be measured and based on the specific activity the amount of antibody or antibody fragment bound to the cell determined.

Fluorescence activated flow cytometry can also be employed. Generally the antibody or antibody fragment is bound to a target cell expressing CD19. A second reagent that binds to the antibody is then added for example a fluorochrome labeled anti immunoglobulin antibody. Fluorochrome staining can then be measured and used to determine the density of antibody or antibody fragment binding to the cell.

As another suitable method the antibody or antibody fragment can be directly labeled with a detectable label such as a fluorophore and bound to a target cell. The ratio of label to protein is determined and compared with standard beads with known amounts of label bound thereto. Comparison of the amount of label bound to the cell with the known standards can be used to calculate the amount of antibody bound to the cell.

In yet another aspect the present invention provides a method for detecting in vitro or in vivo the presence and or density of CD19 in a sample or individual. This can also be useful for monitoring disease and effect of treatment and for determining and adjusting the dose of the antibody to be administered. The in vivo method can be performed using imaging techniques such as PET positron emission tomography or SPECT single photon emission computed tomography . One could also label an anti CD19 antibody with Indium using a covalently attached chelator. The resulting antibody can be imaged using standard gamma cameras the same way as ZEVALIN Indium labeled anti CD20 mAb Biogen Idec Cambridge Mass. is used to image CD20 antigen.

In one embodiment the in vivo method can be performed by contacting a sample to be tested optionally along with a control sample with a human anti CD19 antibody under conditions that allow for formation of a complex between an antibody of the invention and the human CD19 antigen. Complex formation is then detected e.g. using fluorescent activated flow cytometry or Western blotting . When using a control sample along with the test sample a complex is detected in both samples and any statistically significant difference in the formation of complexes between the samples is indicative of the presence of human CD19 in the test sample.

In other embodiments mean florescence intensity can be used as a measure of CD19 density. In such embodiments B cells are removed from a patient and stained with CD19 antibodies that have been labeled with a florescent label and the fluorescence intensity is measured using flow cytometry. Fluorescence intensities can be measured and expressed as an average of intensity per B cell. Using such methods mean florescence intensities that are representative of CD19 density can be compared for a patient before and after treatment using methods and compositions of the invention or between patients and normal levels of hCD19 on B cells.

In patients where the density of CD19 expression on B cells has been determined the density of CD19 may influence the determination and or adjustment of the dosage and or treatment regimen used with an anti CD19 antibody of compositions and methods of the invention. For example where density of CD19 is high it may be possible to use anti CD19 antibodies that less efficiently mediate ADCC in humans. In certain embodiments where the patient treated using compositions and methods of the invention has a low CD19 density a higher dosage of an anti CD19 antibody of compositions and methods of the invention may be used. In other embodiments where the patient treated using compositions and methods of the invention has a low CD19 density a low dosage of an anti CD19 antibody of compositions and methods of the invention may be used. In certain embodiments where the patient treated using compositions and methods of the invention has a high CD19 density a lower dosage of an anti CD19 antibody of compositions and methods of the invention may be used. In certain embodiments CD19 density can be compared to CD20 density in a patient CD19 density can be compared to an average CD19 density for humans or for a particular patient population or CD19 density can be compared to CD19 levels in the patietn prior to therapy or prior to onset of a B cell disease or disorder. In certain embodiments the patient treated using compositions and methods of the invention has a B cell malignancy where CD19 is present on the surface of B cells.

Anti CD19 antibody compositions used in the therapeutic regimen protocols referred to herein as anti CD19 immunotherapy can be naked antibodies immunoconjugates and or fusion proteins. Compositions of the invention can be used as a single agent therapy or in combination with other therapeutic agents or regimens. Anti CD19 antibodies or immunoconjugates can be administered prior to concurrently with or following the administration of one or more therapeutic agents. Therapeutic agents that can be used in combination therapeutic regimens with compositions of the invention include any substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and or causes destruction of cells. Examples include but are not limited to radioactive isotopes chemotherapeutic agents and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof.

The therapeutic regimens described herein or any desired treatment regimen can be tested for efficacy using a transgenic animal model which expresses human CD19 antigen in place of native CD19 antigen. Thus an anti CD19 antibody treatment regimen can be tested in an animal model to determine efficacy before administration to a human.

Anti CD19 antibodies compositions and methods may be practiced to treat B cell diseases including B cell malignancies. The term B cell malignancy includes any malignancy that is derived from a cell of the B cell lineage. Exemplary B cell malignancies include but are not limited to B cell subtype non Hodgkin s lymphoma NHL including low grade follicular NHL small lymphocytic SL NHL intermediate grade follicular NHL intermediate grade diffuse NHL high grade immunoblastic NHL high grade lymphoblastic NHL high grade small non cleaved cell NHL mantle cell lymphoma and bulky disease NHL Burkitt s lymphoma multiple myeloma pre B acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other malignancies that derive from early B cell precursors common acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL including including immunoglobulin mutated CLL and immunoglobulin unmutated CLL hairy cell leukemia Null acute lymphoblastic leukemia Waldenstrom s Macroglobulinemia diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL including germinal center B cell like GCB DLBCL activated B cell like ABC DLBCL and type 3 DLBCL pro lymphocytic leukemia light chain disease plasmacytoma osteosclerotic myeloma plasma cell leukemia monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance MGUS smoldering multiple myeloma SMM indolent multiple myeloma IMM Hodgkin s lymphoma including classical and nodular lymphocyte pre dominant type lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma LPL and marginal zone lymphoma including gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma.

In a further embodiment the invention can be employed to treat mature B cell malignancies i.e. express Ig on the cell surface including but not limited to follicular lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma Burkitt s lymphoma multiple myeloma diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL including germinal center B cell like GCB DLBCL activated B cell like ABC DLBCL and type 3 DLBCL Hodgkin s lymphoma including classical and nodular lymphocyte pre dominant type lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma LPL marginal zone lymphoma including gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL including immunoglobulin mutated CLL and immunoglobulin unmutated CLL.

Further CD19 is expressed earlier in B cell development than for example CD20 and is therefore particularly suited for treating pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies i.e. do not express Ig on the cell surface for example in the bone marrow. Illustrative pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies include but are not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia

In accordance with the present invention anti CD19 immunotherapy encompasses the administration of any of the anti CD19 antibodies of the invention in accordance with any therapeutic regimen described herein. Anti CD19 antibodies can be administered as naked antibodies or immunoconjugates or fusion proteins.

Anti CD19 immunotherapy encompasses the administration of an anti CD19 antibody as a single agent therapeutic for the treatment of a B cell malignancy. Anti CD19 immunotherapy encompasses methods of treating an early stage disease resulting from a B cell malignancy. Anti CD19 immunotherapy encompasses methods of treating a B cell malignancy wherein an anti CD19 antibody mediates ADCC. Anti CD19 immunotherapy encompasses methods of treating a B cell malignancy wherein an anti CD19 antibody is administered before the patient has received any treatment for the malignancy whether that therapy is chemotherapy radio chemical based therapy or surgical therapy.

In one embodiment a human subject having a B cell malignancy can be treated by administering a human or humanized antibody that may be able to mediate human ADCC. In cases of early stage disease or single agent therapies any anti CD19 antibody that may mediate ADCC can be used in the human subjects including murine and chimeric antibodies however human and humanized antibodies may be preferred.

Antibodies of IgG1 or IgG3 human isotypes are in some cases preferred for therapy. However the IgG2 or IgG4 human isotypes can be used as well provided they have the relevant effector function for example human ADCC. Such effector function can be assessed by measuring the ability of the antibody in question to mediate target cell lysis by effector cells in vitro or in vivo.

In one embodiment the dose of antibody used should be sufficient to deplete circulating B cells. Progress of the therapy can be monitored in the patient by analyzing blood samples. Other signs of clinical improvement can be used to monitor therapy.

Methods for measuring depletion of B cells that can be used in connection with compositions and methods of the invention are well known in the art and include but are not limited to the following embodiments. In one embodiment circulating B cells depletion can be measured with flow cytometry using a reagent other than an anti CD19 antibody that binds to B cells to define the amount of B cells. In other embodiments B cell levels in the blood can be monitored using standard serum analysis. In such embodiments B cell depletion is indirectly measured by defining the amount to an antibody known to be produced by B cells. The level of that antibody is then monitored to determine the depletion and or functional depletion of B cells. In another embodiment B cell depletion can be measured by immunochemical staining to identify B cells. In such embodiments B cells or tissues or serum comprising B cells extracted from a patient can be placed on microscope slides labeled and examined for presence or absence. In related embodiments a comparison is made between B cells extracted prior to therapy and after therapy to determine differences in the presence of B cells.

Tumor burden can be measured and used in connection with compositions and methods of the invention. Methods for measuring tumor burden are well known in the art and include but are not limited to the following embodiments. In certain embodiments PET scans can be used to measure metabolic activity and identify areas of higher activity which are indicative of tumors. CT scans and MRI can also be used to examine soft tissue for the presence and size of tumors. In other embodiments bone scan can be used to measure tumor volume and location. In yet other embodiments tumor burden can be measured by examining the blood flow into and out of a tumor using doppler technology e.g. ultrasound . In such embodiments changes in blood flow over time or deviations from normal blood flow in the appropriate tissue of a patient can be used to calculate an estimate to tumor burden. Such methods for measuring tumor burden can be used prior to and following methods of treatment of the invention.

In certain embodiments of methods of the invention B cells are depleted and or tumor burden is decreased while ADCC function is maintained.

In embodiments of the invention where an anti CD19 antibody is administered as a single agent therapy the invention contemplates use of different treatment regimens.

According to certain aspects of the invention an anti CD19 antibody used in compositions and methods of the invention is a naked antibody. In related embodiments the dose of naked anti CD19 antibody used is at least about 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5 8 8.5 9 9.5 10 10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5 13 13.5 14 14.5 15 15.5 16 16.5 17 17.5 18 18.5 19 19.5 20 20.5 mg kg of body weight of a patient. In certain embodiments the dose of naked anti CD19 antibody used is at least about 1 to 10 5 to 15 10 to 20 or 15 to 25 mg kg of body weight of a patient. In certain embodiments the dose of naked anti CD19 antibody used is at least about 1 to 20 3 to 15 or 5 to 10 mg kg of body weight of a patient. In other embodiments the dose of naked anti CD19 antibody used is at least about 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 mg kg of body weight of a patient.

In certain embodiments the dose comprises about 375 mg mof anti CD19 antibody administered weekly for 4 to 8 consecutive weeks. In certain embodiments the dose is at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 or 15 mg kg of body weight of the patient administered weekly for 4 to 8 consecutive weeks.

The exemplary doses of anti CD19 antibody described above can be administered as described in Section 5.21.3. In one embodiment the above doses are single dose injections. In other embodiments the doses are administered over a period of time. In other embodiments the doses are administered multiple times over a period of time. The period of time may be measured in days weeks or months. Multiple doses of an anti CD19 antibody can be administered at intervals suitable to achieve a therapeutic benefit while balancing toxic side effects. For example where multiple doses are used it may be preferred to time the intervals to allow for recovery of the patient s monocyte count prior to the repeat treatment with antibody. This dosing regimen will optimize the efficiency of treatment since the monocyte population reflects ADCC function in the patient.

In certain embodiments compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient as long as the patient is responsive to therapy. In other embodiments compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient as long as the patient s disease does not progress. In related embodiments compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient until a patient s disease does not progress or has not progressed for a period of time then the patient is not administered compositions of the invention unless the disease reoccurs or begins to progress again. For example a patient can be treated with any of the above doses for about 4 to 8 weeks during which time the patient is monitored for disease progression. If disease progression stops or reverses then the patient will not be administered compositions of the invention until that patient relapses i.e. the disease being treated reoccurs or progresses. Upon this reoccurrence or progression the patient can be treated again with the same dosing regimen initially used or using other doses described above.

In certain embodiments compositions of the invention can be administered as a loading dose followed by multiple lower doses maintenance doses over a period of time. In such embodiments the doses may be timed and the amount adjusted to maintain effective B cell depletion. In certain embodiments the loading dose is about 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 or 18 mg kg of patient body weight and the maintenance dose is at least about 5 to 10 mg kg of patient body weight. In other embodiments the maintenance dose is administered at intervals of every 7 10 14 or 21 days. The maintenance doses can be continued indefinitely until toxicity is present until platelet count decreases until there is no disease progression until the patient exhibits immunogenicity or until disease progresses to a terminal state. In yet other embodiments compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient until the disease progresses to a terminal stage.

In embodiments of the invention where circulating monocyte levels of a patient are monitored as part of a treatment regimen doses of anti CD19 antibody administered may be spaced to allow for recovery of monocyte count. For example a composition of the invention may be administered at intervals of every 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 or 30 days.

In embodiments of the invention where an anti CD19 antibody is conjugated to or administered in conjunction with a toxin one skilled in the art will appreciate that the dose of anti CD19 antibody can be adjusted based on the toxin dose and that the toxin dose will depend on the specific type of toxin being used. Typically where a toxin is used the dose of anti CD19 antibody will be less than the dose used with a naked anti CD19 antibody. The appropriate dose can be determined for a particular toxin using techniques well known in the art. For example a dose range study can be conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose of anti CD19 antibody when administered with or conjugated to a toxin.

In embodiments of the invention where an anti CD19 antibody is conjugated to or administered in conjunction with a radiotherapeutic agent the dose of the anti CD19 antibody will vary depending on the radiotherapeutic used. In certain embodiments a two step process is used. First the human patient is administered a composition comprising a naked anti CD19 antibody and about 6 7 8 9 or 10 days later a small amount of the radiotherapeutic is administered. Second once the tolerance distribution and clearance of the low dose therapy has been determined the patient is administered a dose of the naked anti CD19 antibody followed by a therapeutic amount of the radiotherapeutic is administered. Such treatment regimens are similar to those approved for treatment of Non Hodgkin s lymphoma using ZEVALIN Indium labeled anti CD20 mAb Biogen Idec or BEXXAR GSK Coulter Pharmaceutical .

Anti CD19 immunotherapy using naked antibody immunoconjugates or fusion proteins can be used in conjunction with other therapies including but not limited to chemotherapy radioimmunotherapy RIT chemotherapy and external beam radiation combined modality therapy CMT or combined modality radioimmunotherapy CMRIT alone or in combination etc. In certain embodiments an anti CD19 antibody therapy of the present invention can be administered in conjunction with CHOP Cyclophosphamide Hydroxydoxorubicin Oncovin vincristine Prednisolone the most common chemotherapy regimen for treating non Hodgkin s lymphoma. As used herein the term administered in conjunction with means that an anti CD19 immunotherapy can be administered before during or subsequent to the other therapy employed.

In certain embodiments an anti CD19 immunotherapy is in conjunction with a cytotoxic radionuclide or radiotherapeutic isotope. For example an alpha emitting isotope such as Ac Ac At Bi Bi Pb Ra or Ra. The cytotoxic radionuclide may also be a beta emitting isotope such as Re Re Y I Cu Lu Sm Ho or Cu. Further the cytotoxic radionuclide may emit Auger and low energy electrons and include the isotopes I I or Br. In other embodiments the isotope may be Au P and the like. In certain embodiments the amount of the radionuclide administered to the subject is between about 0.001 mCi kg and about 10 mCi kg.

In some embodiments the amount of the radionuclide administered to the subject is between about 0.1 mCi kg and about 1.0 mCi kg. In other embodiments the amount of the radionuclide administered to the subject is between about 0.005 mCi kg and 0.1 mCi kg.

In certain embodiments an anti CD19 immunotherapy is in conjunction with a chemical toxin or chemotherapeutic agent. The chemical toxin or chemotherapeutic agent may be selected from the group consisting of an enediyne such as calicheamicin and esperamicin duocarmycin methotrexate doxorubicin melphalan chlorambucil ARA C vindesine mitomycin C cis platinum etoposide bleomycin and 5 fluorouracil.

Suitable chemical toxins or chemotherapeutic agents that can be used in combination therapies with an anti CD19 immunotherapy include members of the enediyne family of molecules such as calicheamicin and esperamicin. Chemical toxins can also be taken from the group consisting of duocarmycin see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 703 080 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 923 990 methotrexate doxorubicin melphalan chlorambucil ARA C vindesine mitomycin C cis platinum etoposide bleomycin and 5 fluorouracil. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents also include Adriamycin Doxorubicin 5 Fluorouracil Cytosine arabinoside Ara C Cyclophosphamide Thiotepa Taxotere docetaxel Busulfan Cytoxin Taxol Methotrexate Cisplatin Melphalan Vinblastine Bleomycin Etoposide Ifosfamide Mitomycin C Mitoxantrone Vincreistine Vinorelbine Carboplatin Teniposide Daunomycin Caminomycin Aminopterin Dactinomycin Mitomycins Esperamicins see U.S. Pat. No. 4 675 187 Melphalan and other related nitrogen mustards.

In other embodiments for example CVB 1.5 g mcyclophosphamide 200 400 mg metoposide and 150 200 mg mcarmustine can be used in combination therapies of the invention. CVB is a regimen used to treat non Hodgkin s lymphoma. Patti et al. 51 18 1993 . Other suitable combination chemotherapeutic regimens are well known to those of skill in the art. See for example Freedman et al. in CANCER MEDICINE VOLUME 2 3rd Edition Holland et al eds. pp. 2028 2068 Lea Febiger 1993 . As an illustration first generation chemotherapeutic regimens for treatment of intermediate grade non Hodgkin s lymphoma include C MOPP cyclophosphamide vincristine procarbazine and prednisone and CHOP cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine and prednisone . A useful second generation chemotherapeutic regimen is m BACOD methotrexate bleomycin doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine dexamethasone and leucovorin while a suitable third generation regimen is MACOP B methotrexate doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine prednisone bleomycin and leucovorin . Additional useful drugs include phenyl butyrate and brostatin 1. In a multimodal therapy both chemotherapeutic drugs and cytokines are co administered with an antibody immunoconjugate or fusion protein according to the present invention. The cytokines chemotherapeutic drugs and antibody immunoconjugate or fusion protein can be administered in any order or together.

Other toxins that may be used in compositions and methods of the invention include poisonous lectins plant toxins such as ricin abrin modeccin botulina and diphtheria toxins. Of course combinations of the various toxins could also be coupled to one antibody molecule thereby accommodating variable cytotoxicity. Illustrative of toxins which are suitably employed in combination therapies of the invention are ricin abrin ribonuclease DNase I Staphylococcal enterotoxin A pokeweed antiviral protein gelonin diphtherin toxin exotoxin and endotoxin. See for example Pastan et al. 47 641 1986 and Goldenberg et al. 44 43 1994 . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes.

Suitable toxins and chemotherapeutic agents are described in REMINGTON S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES 19th Ed. Mack Publishing Co. 1995 and in GOODMAN AND GILMAN S THE PHARMACOLOGICAL BASIS OF THERAPEUTICS 7th Ed. MacMillan Publishing Co. 1985 . Other suitable toxins and or chemotherapeutic agents are known to those of skill in the art.

An anti CD19 immunotherapy of the present invention may also be in conjunction with a prodrug activating enzyme which converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent see WO81 01145 to an active anti cancer drug. See for example WO 88 07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278. The enzyme component of such combinations includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active cytotoxic form. The term prodrug as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See e.g. Wilman 14 pp. 375 382 615th Meeting Belfast 1986 and Stella et al. Borchardt et al. ed. pp. 247 267 Humana Press 1985 . Prodrugs that can be used in combination with anti CD19 antibodies include but are not limited to phosphate containing prodrugs thiophosphate containing prodrugs sulfate containing prodrugs peptide containing prodrugs D amino acid modified prodrugs glycosylated prodrugs lactam containing prodrugs optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide containing prodrugs 5 fluorocytosine and other 5 fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug.

In certain embodiments of methods of the invention a compound that enhances monocyte or macrophage function e.g. at least about 25 50 75 85 90 95 or more can be used in conjunction with an anti CD19 immunotherapy. Such compounds are known in the art and include without limitation cytokines such as interleukins e.g. IL 12 and interferons e.g. alpha or gamma interferon .

The compound that enhances monocyte or macrophage function or enhancement can be formulated in the same pharmaceutical composition as the antibody immunoconjugate or antigen binding fragment. When administered separately the antibody fragment and the compound can be administered concurrently within a period of hours of each other can be administered during the same course of therapy or can be administered sequentially i.e. the patient first receives a course of the antibody fragment treatment and then a course of the compound that enhances macrophage monocyte function or vice versa . In such embodiments the compound that enhances monocyte or macrophage function is administered to the human subject prior to concurrently with or following treatment with other therapeutic regimens and or compositions of the invention. In one embodiment the human subject has a blood leukocyte monocyte neutrophil lymphocyte and or basophil count that is within the normal range for humans. Normal ranges for human blood leukocytes total is about 3.5 about 10.5 10 L . Normal ranges for human blood neutrophils is about 1.7 about 7.0 10 L monocytes is about 0.3 about 0.9 10 L lymphocytes is about 0.9 about 2.9 10 L basophils is about 0 about 0.3 10 L and eosinophils is about 0.05 about 0.5 10 L . In other embodiments the human subject has a blood leukocyte count that is less than the normal range for humans for example at least about 0.01 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 or 0.8 10 L leukocytes.

This embodiment of the invention can be practiced with the antibodies immunocongugates or antibody fragments of the invention or with other antibodies known in the art and is particularly suitable for subjects that are resistant to anti CD22 anti CD52 and or anti CD20 antibody therapy for example therapy with existing antibodies such as C2B8 subjects that are currently being or have previously been treated with chemotherapy subjects that have had a relapse in a B cell disorder subjects that are immunocompromised or subjects that otherwise have an impairment in macrophage or monocyte function. The prevalence of patients that are resistant to therapy or have a relapse in a B cell disorder may be attributable at least in part to an impairment in macrophage or monocyte function. Thus the invention provides methods of enhancing ADCC and or macrophage and or monocyte function to be used in conjunction with the methods of administering anti CD19 antibodies and antigen binding fragments.

Representative primer sets for the assembly of the HB12B 3 72 JH4 VH region and the HB12B A10 Jk4 VK are shown in Table 3 primer sets for variant VH and VK regions comprising specific amino acid substitutions were generated by modifying the nucleic acid sequence of the primer encoding the given amino acid residue. Primers were designed to overlap by 15 20 nucleotides and were ligated into a complete variable region during thermal cycling. In case of VH an additional vector specific primer Universal VH FW in Table 3 was included in the PCR mediated gene assembly process. The external 5 and 3 primers for VH region incorporated a unique recognition site for the XbaI and ApaI restriction endonuclease respectively to help with the subsequent cloning steps. The external 5 and 3 primers for VK incorporated a unique recognition site for the XmaI and BsiWI restriction endonuclease respectively to help with the subsequent cloning steps. PCR products of the correct size were restriction digested and ligated in frame into an expression vector wherein VH regions were digested with XbaI and ApaI and VK regions were digested with XmaI and BsiWI according to the manufacturer s instructions. The vector used for heavy chain assembly comprises eukaryotic transcription control elements operably linked to a polynucleotide encoding the MGDNDIHFAFLSTGVHS VH leader SEQ ID NO 83 and a human IgH 1 constant region wherein said transcription control elements comprise a CMV immediate early promoter and a SV40 poly A addition signal. The use of appropriately designed primers for VH assembly ensured that the polynucleotide sequences encoding the VH leader VH region and IgH 1 constant region were joined in frame within the final heavy chain expression vector. The vector for light chain assembly comprises eukaryotic transcription control elements operably linked to a polynucleotide encoding the human VKI L12 leader amino acid sequence MDMRVPAQLLGLLLLWLPGAKC SEQ ID NO 84 Bentley D. L. Rabbitts T. H. 288 730 733 1980 and a human IgL constant region wherein said transcription control elements comprise a CMV immediate early promoter and a SV40 poly A addition signal. The use of appropriately designed primers for VK assembly ensured that the polynucleotide sequences encoding the VKI L12 leader VK region and IgL constant region were joined in frame within the final light chain expression vector. The ligation product was used to transform DH10B competent cells according to the manufacturer s protocols. Colonies containing the plasmid and a correct sized insert can be identified using various methods known in the art e.g. restriction digest of vector DNA preparation PCR amplification of vector sequences .

A standard ELISA protocol can be used for the cell based CD19 binding assay. For example individual wells of a 96 well U bottom plate are seeded with 1 10e5 300B4 cells and incubated overnight. Cells are washed once with ELISA buffer prior to incubation on ice with human humanized or chimeric HB12B antibodies. Binding reactions are performed in triplicates for each antibody concentration tested. Negative control wells using an isotype matched antibody of irrelevant specificity should be included in the assay. Following incubation with the antibody 300B4 cells are washed three times with 200 micro liter of ELISA buffer. The amount of chimeric humanized or human anti CD19 antibodies bound to 300B4 cells can be detected using a goat anti human kappa antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase according to standard protocols.

The CytoTox 96 Non Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay Promega is a calorimetric alternative to Cr release cytotoxicity assays. The CytoTox 96 Assay quantitatively measures lactate dehydrogenase LDH a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released upon cell lysis. Released LDH in culture supernatants is measured with a 30 minute coupled enzymatic assay which results in the conversion of a tetrazolium salt INT into a red formazan product. The amount of color formed is proportional to the number of lysed cells.

The assays are performed according to the manufacturer s directions. Briefly target cells are washed with PBS resuspended in RPMI 5 Phenol Free media at a cell density of 0.4 10 ml. NK effector cells are washed once in PBS and resuspended in RPMI 5 Phenol Free media at a cell density 1 10 ml. Assays are performed in U bottom 96 well plates. Each assay plate includes a combination of experimental and control wells. Experimental wells are set up by combining 50 l of the appropriate antibody dilution 50 ul of target cell suspension and 50 ul of effector cell suspension. The cell densities described above result in a 1 2.5 target to effector cell ratio effector cell stock may be further diluted or concentrated if a different target to effector ratio is desired. Several different types of control wells are used to account for i the spontaneous LDH release form target cells Target Spontaneous ii the spontaneous LDH release from effector cells Effector Spontaneous iii the maximum LDH release from the target cells Target Maximum and iv the presence of contaminants in the culture medium Background . All wells in use on a 96 well plate contain the same final volume. Reactions are set up in triplicates. Following set up plates are spun at 120 g for 3 minutes to pellet the cells. Incubate plate at 37 C. 5 COfor 4 hours. Forty five minutes prior to the end of incubation 15 l of manufacturer provided Lysis Buffer is added to the Target Cell Maximum Release Control well. After incubation the plate is centrifuged at 120 g for 4 minutes. 50 l of the supernatant from each well is transferred to a new flat bottom 96 well plate. 50 l of reconstituted substrate mix assembled from manufacturer provided components is added and the plate is incubated at room temperature 10 20 minutes protected from light. 50 l of manufacturer provided stop buffer is added and absorbance at 490 or 492 nm is measured in a plate reader. cytotoxicity equals Experimental Effector spontaneous Target Spontaneous Target Maximum Target Spontaneous .

3649 efficiently recruits effector cells to human CD20 expressing target cells in an ADCC assay. The ADCC activity of the afucosylated form 3649 aFuc is even more robust. Fc variants with increased 3649 3M or decreased 3649 TM affinity for Fc receptors display increased or decreased respectively ADCC activity as expected. ADCC activity was observed with both immortalized and freshly isolated human target cells. A representative sample of the experimental data supporting these assertions is presented in .

7.2.3. In Vitro Anti CD19 Antibody Mediated ADCC is Influenced by Fc Region Affinity to Fc RIIIA Receptor

Relative binding affinity of various humanized anti CD19 antibody preparations to human Fc RIIIA receptor CD16 may be ascertained using an ELISA assay. Microtiter plates are coated with 50 l antibody preparation 50 g ml at 4 C. overnight. Any remaining binding sites are blocked with 4 skimmed milk in PBS buffer blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 C. After washing the wells 50 l of serially diluted monomeric Fc RIIIA flag protein is added to each well and incubated for 60 min at 37 C. 50 l of 2.5 g ml anti flag ME biotin Sigma is added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 C. Wells are washed between incubation with each of the following reagents. 50 l of 0.1 g ml avidin conjugated HRP PIERCE is added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 C. Detection is carried out by adding 30 l of tetramethylbenzidine TMB substrate Pierce followed by neutralization with 30 l of 0.2 M HSO. The absorbance was read at 450 nm.

As shown in the binding affinity of the enhanced ADCC Fc variant 3649 antibody 3649 3M and afucosylated 3649 antibody 3649 aFuc for FcgRIIIA is higher than that of the fucosylated wild type 3649 antibody. The experiment was performed using an Fc RIIIA flag protein comprising the extracellular domain of the V158 high affinity isoform of human Fc RIIIA.

The Fc receptor Fc region interaction and thus the effector function of an antibody are also influenced by allelic variations in the Fc receptor. The effect of high affinity and low affinity FcgRIIIA receptors on ADCC may be studied by performing ADCC reactions with freshly isolated NK effector cells comprising different allelic variant receptors. summarizes the results of such an experiment. ADCC reactions are performed as described above using Daudi target cells. Both fucosylated 3649 and afucosylated 3649 aFuc anti CD19 antibody 2 is tested. Control reactions are done using an anti CD20 antibody. NK effector cells are isolated from healthy donors following standard protocols. NK cell genotype may be determined utilizing allele specific PCR reactions see Leppers van de Straat et al. 242 1 2 127 32 2000 . A and B show that all three antibodies tested display ADCC activity under the reaction conditions used. The ADCC activity is detectable using either an NK cell line A or freshly isolated NK cells B as effectors. NK cells that comprise at least one copy of the high affinity isoform of Fc RIIIA receptor V158 V158 and V158 F158 genotypes are more efficient effector cells than NK cells homozygous for the low affinity receptor alleles F158 F158 genotype . Lack of fucosylation increases the ADCC activity of an antibody regardless of the Fc RIIIA genotype of the effector cells. The observed ADCC activity of the fucosylated antibody 3649 mediated by V158 V158 or V158 F158 NK cells C D is comparable to the ADCC activity of the afucosylated antibody 3649 aFuc mediated by F158 F158 NK cells E .

In order to determine whether human CD19 is expressed on B cells from transgenic mice hCD19tg expressing the human CD19 transgene B cells would be extracted from the bone marrow blood spleen and peritoneal lavage of these mice. Human CD19 and mouse CD19 expression would be assessed in these cells by contacting the cells with anti CD19 antibodies that specifically bind human CD19 or mouse CD19 mCD19 . Binding of the antibody to the B lineage cells would be detected using two color immunofluorescence staining with flow cytometry analysis. The relative expression levels of mCD19 and hCD19 would be assessed by measuring mean fluorescence intensity anti hCD19 for hCD19 and anti mCD19 for mCD19 respectively.

Expression level of a human CD19 and human CD20 transgenes was determined essentially as described above. Circulating lymphocytes are isolated form C57Bl6 hCD19 tg C57Bl6 hCD19 tg Balb c hCD20 tg and Balb c wild type mice using standard procedures. Animals were housed in a pathogen free facility. The age and number of animals used from each genotype is listed in . Isolated cells are stained with PerCP Cy5.5 conjugated anti mouse CD19 clone 1D3 BD Biosciences PE conjugated anti CD3 e.g. clone 17A2 BD Biosciences Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti human CD19 clone HIB19 BD Biosciences and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated anti human CD20 antibodies e.g. clone 2H7 AbD serotec . Immunostained cells are analyzed on a flow cytometer. B cell population is defined as anti mouse CD19 anti CD3 cells. Mean fluorescence intensity of anti mouse CD19 anti CD3 cells detected in the hCD19 and hCD20 channels is described in . Human CD19 expression is detected only on hCD19 transgenic cells as expected. hCD19 expression is dose dependent staining levels in tg is approximately twice that of seen on tg B cells. hCD19 expression level was stable in all age groups examined.

Percentage of B cells among circulating lymphocytes was calculated for all samples. B cells were defined as anti mouse CD19 anti CD3 cells for the purpose of the calculation. Results are displayed in . Animals with a hCD19 transgene have reduced B cell numbers among circulating lymphocytes. Reduction in B cell numbers are more pronounced in hCD19 tg animals. These results are in agreement with previously published observations Zhou et al. 14 3884 3894 1994 .

Anti CD19 antibodies of the invention which bind to human CD19 can be assessed for their ability to deplete hCD19tg blood spleen and lymph node B cells in vivo. For example each antibody would be given to mice at either 250 or 50 g mouse a single dose about 10 to 50 fold lower than the 375 mg mdose primarily given four times for anti CD20 therapy in humans Maloney et al. 15 3266 74 1997 and McLaughlin et al. Williston Park 12 1763 9 1998 . B cell depletion from blood spleen and lymph nodes of hCD19tg mice would be determined by immunofluorescence staining with flow cytometry analysis. The results using anti CD19 antibodies identified as capable of depleting B cells can be correlated to use in humans and antibodies with properties of the identified antibodies can be used in the compositions and methods of the invention for the treatment of human B cell disorders and disease including but not limited to B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases or disorders.

3649 humanized anti CD19 antibody was tested in a B cell depletion assay essentially as described above. C57Bl6 hCD19 tg and C57Bl6 hCD19 tg mice are given a single i.v. dose of 50 or 250 g 3649 antibody. Two control groups are used. Members of the first group receive 50 or 250 g of R347 antibody of irrelevant specificity members of the second group receive 50 or 250 g of the 3649 TM Fc variant with diminished ADCC activity see . Number of animals in each group are described in . Animals are housed in a pathogen free facility. 7 days post treatment mononuclear cells are isolated from circulating blood and spleens. Isolated cells are stained with PerCP Cy5.5 conjugated anti mouse CD19 clone 1D3 BD Biosciences and Apc Cy5.5 conjugated anti mouse B220 cloneRA3 6B2 Invitrogen antibodies. Immunostained samples are analyzed on a flow cytometer. B cells are defined as anti mouse CD19 anti mouse B220 cells for the purposes of the experiment. The percentage of B cells among circulating lymphocytes is presented in . The percentage and absolute number of B cells among spleen cells is described in . A single dose of 50 mg 3649 anti CD19 antibody is sufficient to achieve significant depletion of circulating and splenic B cells. Level of depletion is influenced by antibody dose and hCD19 surface density. Depletion is most complete in hCD19 tg animals receiving 250 g antibody. Depletion is more extensive among circulating lymphocytes than in spleen in all animals tested.

A separate study was also performed to measure the ability of various 3649 anti CD19 antibody preparations to deplete circulating splenic peritoneal and bone marrow B cell subpopulations in a hCD19 tg animal. The experiment was performed as follows Three to four month old sex matched C57Bl6 hCD19 tg mice were injected through the lateral tail veins with sterile endotoxin free anti CD19 antibody preparations diluted in PBS at 10 50 or 250 ug per mouse doses. The following anti CD19 antibodies were tested fucosylated anti CD19 antibody 2 3649 afucosylated anti CD19 antibody 2 3649 aFuc ADCC enhanced Fc variant anti CD19 antibody 2 3649 3M and reduced ADCC Fc variant anti CD19 antibody 2 3649 TM . A group of control animals were injected with an isotype matched control antibody of irrelevant specificity R347 . Seven days post injection mice were scarified and cells from blood spleen bona marrow and peritoneal cavity were collected. Red cells were lysed following standard protocols and total viable cell count was determined using a Via Cell automated cell counting machine. Isolated single cell suspensions were immunostained and analyzed on a flow cytometer following standard protocols. Antibodies used for immunostaining are listed in Table 5. Depletion results are summarized in Tables 6 21. Depletion results obtained using the afucosylated anti CD19 antibody 2 3649 aFuc is presented in . NK cell activation phenotype of animals treated with the afucosylated or fucosylated anti CD19 antibody 2 3649 aFuc or 3649 respectively is presented in . B cell subset definitions used during the analysis are as follows 

To determine whether an anti CD19 antibody s ability to deplete B cells is dependent on CD19 density anti CD19 antibodies of the invention can be administered to mice having varying levels of hCD19 expression. The results obtained will demonstrate whether human CD19 density on B cells and antibody isotype can influence the depletion of B cells in the presence of an anti CD19 antibody. The same assay can be used to determine whether other anti CD19 antibodies can effectively deplete B cells. The results can be correlated to treatment of human patients with varying levels of CD19 expression. Thus the methods for examining CD19 presence and density described herein can be used in human subjects to identify patients or patient populations for which certain anti CD19 antibodies can deplete B cells and or to determine suitable dosages.

To determine whether CD19 density influences the effectiveness of anti CD19 antibody induced B cell depletion representative blood and spleen B cell depletion can be examined in hCD19tg mice after treatment with the anti CD19 antibodies of the invention 7 days 250 g mouse . The results are expected to demonstrate that CD19 density influences the efficiency of B cell depletion by anti CD19 antibodies in vivo. For example low level CD19 expression in hCD19tg mice would be expected to have a marked influence on circulating or tissue B cell depletion by the administered antibody. B cell clearance can be assessed 24 hours after anti CD19 or control mAb treatment of individual mice.

Should administration of an anti CD19 mAb of the invention result in tissue B cell depletion the following assays can be used to demonstrate dependence upon Fc R expression. Through a process of interbreeding hCD19tg mice with mice lacking expression of certain Fc R mice can be generated that express hCD19 and lack expression of certain Fc R. Such mice can be used in assays to assess the ability of anti CD19 antibodies to deplete B cells through pathways that involve Fc R expression e.g. ADCC. Thus anti CD19 antibodies identified in these assays can be used to engineer chimeric human or humanized anti CD19 antibodies using the techniques described above. Such antibodies can in turn be used in the compositions and methods of the invention for the treatment of human B cell disorders and diseases including but not limited to autoimmune diseases and disorders.

The innate immune system mediates B cell depletion following anti CD20 antibody treatment through Fc R dependent processes. Mouse effector cells express four different Fc R classes for IgG the high affinity Fc RI CD64 and the low affinity Fc RII CD32 Fc RIII CD16 and Fc RIV molecules. Fc RI Fc RIII and Fc RIV are hetero oligomeric complexes in which the respective ligand binding chains associate with a common chain FcR . FcR chain expression is required for Fc R assembly and for Fc R triggering of effector functions including phagocytosis by macrophages. Since FcR mice lack high affinity Fc RI CD64 and low affinity Fc RIII CD16 and Fc RIV molecules FcR mice expressing hCD19 can be used to assess the role of Fc R in tissue B cell depletion following anti CD19 antibody treatment.

To assess the efficacy and duration of B cell depletion hCD19tg mice can be administered a single low dose e.g. 250 g injection of anti CD19 antibody and the duration and dose response of B cell depletion followed as a function of time. The results are expected to demonstrate that circulating B cells are depleted for a substantial amount of time e.g. one week to six months followed by a gradual recovery of blood borne B cells.

Whether CD19 internalization will influence B cell depletion in vivo can be assessed by comparing cell surface CD19 expression following administration of the anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention. For example cell surface CD19 expression and B cell clearance in hCD19tg mice treated with an anti CD19 antibody of the present invention or isotype matched control antibody 250 g in vivo can be studied as a function of time. Thus spleen B cells can be harvested and assayed for CD19 at time zero prior to anti CD19 administration and at 1 4 and 24 hours post antibody administration. Isolated B cells may also be treated in vitro with saturating concentrations of each anti CD19 antibody plus isotype specific secondary antibody in vitro with flow cytometry analysis to visualize total cell surface CD19 expression. Where CD19 on the surface of B cells is maintained it will indicate continued susceptibility to ADCC CDC and apoptosis. If CD19 persists on the cell surface following binding of an anti CD19 antibody the B cell will remain accessible to the ADCC CDC or apoptotic activity. Such results would demonstrate in part why the anti CD19 antibodies and treatment regimens of the invention will be efficacious in providing therapy for human B cell disorders and diseases including but not limited to transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases and disorders.

In the event CD19 therapy decreases B cell representation then the assays described in this example can be used to demonstrate that the anti CD19 antibodies of the invention are capable of eliminating or attenuating immune responses. These assays can also be used to identify other anti CD19 antibodies that can be used to engineer chimeric human or humanized anti CD19 antibodies using the techniques described above. Such antibodies can in turn be used in the compositions and methods of the invention for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and disorders in humans as well as for transplantation therapy.

The effect of anti CD19 antibody induced B cell depletion on serum antibody levels can be assessed by giving hCD19tg mice a single injection of anti CD19 antibody and then assessing the reduction in immunoglobulin levels in those mice. For example two month old littermates can be treated with a single injection of an anti CD19 antibody of the present invention or a control antibody e.g. 250 g on day 0. Antibody levels are then determined by ELISA. It is expected that the results will show that after 1 to 2 weeks serum IgM IgG2b IgG3 and IgA antibody levels are significantly reduced and remain reduced for at least 10 weeks.

The influence of B cell depletion on T cell independent type 1 TI 1 and type 2 TI 2 antibody responses may also be assessed by immunizing hCD19tg mice with TNP LPS or DNP Ficoll at day zero 7 days after anti CD19 antibody or control antibody treatment. Significant hapten specific IgM IgG and IgA antibody responses are expected not to be observed in anti CD19 antibody treated mice immunized with either antigen. Antibody responses to the T cell dependent TD Ag DNP KLH may also be assessed using mice treated with anti CD19 antibody 7 days before immunization where it is expected that DNP KLH immunized mice treated with anti CD19 antibody will show reduced humoral immunity.

The assay described herein can be used to determine whether combination therapies e.g. anti CD19 antibodies in combination with chemotherapy toxin therapy or radiotherapy have beneficial effects such as an additive or more that additive depletion in B cells. The results of combination therapies tested in animal models can be correlated to humans by means well known in the art.

Anti CD20 antibodies are effective in depleting human and mouse B cells in vivo. Therefore the benefit of simultaneous treatment with an anti CD19 antibody of the present invention and anti CD20 e.g. MB20 11 see Yazawa et al. 102 42 15178 83 2005 antibodies can be assessed to determine whether this will enhance B cell depletion. Mice can be treated with suboptimal doses e.g. 2 g 5 g 10 g 20 g or 50 g of each antibody either individually or as a combination of both antibodies. It is expected that the results will demonstrate that simultaneous anti CD19 and anti CD20 antibody treatments are beneficial. In a similar manner the efficacy may be determine for treatment with a combination of an anti CD19 antibody of the present invention with an anti CD22 antibody or a combination of an anti CD19 antibody of the present invention an anti CD20 antibody and an anti CD22 antibody.

The assay described herein can be used to determine whether a subcutaneous route of administration of an anti CD19 antibody of the invention can effectively deplete B cells. The results of the efficacy of different delivery routes tested in animal models can be correlated to humans by means well known in the art.

For example hCD19tg mice can be treated with an anti CD19 antibody of the invention at 250 g either by subcutaneous s.c. intraperitoneal i.p. or intravenous i.v. administration. Values are determined for the mean SEM blood per mL bone marrow spleen lymph node and peritoneal cavity B220 B cell numbers on day seven as assessed using flow cytometry. Results are expected to demonstrate that subcutaneous s.c. intraperitoneal i.p. and intravenous i.v. administration of an anti CD19 antibody of the invention will effectively deplete circulating and tissue B cells in vivo.

The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein. Indeed various modifications of the invention in addition to those described will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying figures. Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.

Anti CD19 antibodies of the invention which bind to human CD19 may be assessed for their ability to reduce tumor growth in in vivo animal models. For example SCID mice would be injected with human lymphoma cell lines to establish a tumor xenograft e.g. s.c. injection of Raji cells . Subsequently the mice would be given several doses of an anti CD19 antibody of the invention e.g. 100 g antibody mouse 5 times . Tumor growth would be followed using standard methods e.g. tumor volume animal weight paralysis The effect of anti CD19 treatment on tumor growth may be determined by comparing animals receiving anti CD19 or control antibody treatment. The results obtained using anti CD19 antibodies identified as capable of reducing tumor growth can be correlated to use in humans and antibodies capable of reducing tumor growth can be used in the compositions and methods of the invention for the treatment of human B cell disorders and disease including but not limited to B cell malignancies.

To determine whether an anti CD19 antibody s ability to reduce tumor growth is dependent on CD19 density tumor cell lines with different CD19 expression profiles may be tested in the above described in vivo tumor growth assay. For example Daudi Raji Namalwa and Ramos cells all have significant levels of CD19 on their cell surface RPMI 8226 multiple myeloma cell line on the other hand does not express CD19. The results obtained may demonstrate whether human CD19 density on the tumor cell surface can influence the tumor growth reducing activity of an anti CD19 antibody. The results can be correlated to treatment of human patients with varying levels of CD19 expression. Thus the methods for examining CD19 presence and density described herein can be used in human subjects to identify patients or patient populations for which certain anti CD19 antibodies can reduce the growth of malignant B cells and or to determine suitable dosages.

To determine whether an anti CD19 antibody s ability to reduce tumor growth is dependent Fc R the above described in vivo tumor growth assay would be performed using SCID mice with compromised Fc receptor activity e.g. FcR . Through a process of interbreeding SCID mice with mice lacking expression of certain Fc R SCID mice can be generated that also lack expression of certain Fc R e.g. SCID FcR mice . Such mice can be used in assays to assess the ability of anti CD19 antibodies to reduce tumor growth through pathways that involve Fc R expression e.g. ADCC. Based on the results anti CD19 antibodies with increased ADCC can be engineered using the techniques described above. Such antibodies can in turn be used in the compositions and methods of the invention for the treatment of human B cell disorders and diseases including but not limited to B cell malignancies.

Following are the details of experiments demonstrating the ability of 3649 humanized anti CD19 antibody to reduce tumor growth in an in vivo animal model. On day 1 of the experiment 4 6 weeks old female CB 17 SCID mice are injected s.c. with 5 10Raji human lymphoma cells in their hind flank. Raji cells express significant levels of CD19 on their surface and are sensitive to 3649 directed ADCC see . Groups of 10 Raji cells injected animals are treated with a humanized anti CD19 antibody control anti CD20 antibody isotype control antibody of irrelevant specificity. Multiple different doses of an antibody may be tested side by side. A non limiting example for treatment schedule is 5 bi weekly i.p. doses of 10 mg kg antibody starting on day 4. An additional control group of animals receiving PBS only is included as well. Tumor volume is measured using standard methods. Animals with tumor volume greater than 2000 mmor with significant signs of morbidity are humanely euthanized. Tumor growth is plotted over time.

In the experiment summarized in ten Raji cell injected animals each were treated with 5 bi weekly i.p. doses of 10 mg kg i anti CD20 antibody ii 3649 TM Fc variant with reduced ADCC iii 3649 antibody or iv R347 control antibody starting on day 4. An additional control group of 10 animals received PBS only. Treatment with 3649 anti CD19 antibody and positive control anti CD20 antibody significantly reduced tumor growth. The standard deviation in tumor size for the groups receiving 3649 or anti CD20 antibody increased with time because of the presence of completely tumor free individuals in both treatment groups. The 3649 TM Fc variant did not have a significant effect on tumor growth suggesting that the tumor growth reducing effect of 3649 humanized anti CD19 antibody is mediated through ADCC.

In the experiment summarized in ten Raji cell injected animals each were treated with 5 bi weekly i.p. doses of i anti CD20 antibody at 10 mg kg anti CD20 ii 3649 TM Fc variant with reduced ADCC at 10 mg kg 3649 iii 3649 antibody at 10 mg kg 3649 iv 3649 antibody at 2.5 mg kg 3649 or v R347 control antibody at 10 mg kg starting on day 4. Treatment with 3649 anti CD19 antibody 3649 3M human ADCC enhanced anti CD 19 antibody and positive control anti CD20 antibody significantly reduced tumor growth. The 3649 TM Fc variant anti CD19 antibody did not have a significant effect on tumor growth suggesting that the tumor growth reducing effect of 3649 is mediated through ADCC.

In the experiment summarized in ten Raji cell injected animals each were treated with 5 bi weekly i.p. doses of i anti CD20 antibody at 10 mg kg anti CD20 ii 3649 antibody at 10 mg kg 3649 iii afucosylated 3649 antibody at 2.5 or 10 mg kg 3649 aFuc or iv R347 control antibody at 10 mg kg starting on day 4. Treatment with 3649 anti CD19 antibody 3649 aFuc anti CD 19 antibody and positive control anti CD20 antibody significantly reduced tumor growth.

The following sections describe the identification of affinity matured CDR variants of the 3649 anti CD19 antibody that display an increased binding affinity towards cell surface displayed human CD19 antigen compared to the parental 3649 anti CD19 antibody. The section also describes the in vitro characterization of the affinity matured anti CD19 antibodies.

3649 variant anti CD19 antibodies were identified by screening Fab fragment libraries comprising variant CDR sequences see US Patent Application Publication No. US2006 0121042 Wu H. 207 197 212 2003 Wu An 207 213 33 2003 Wu et al. 350 126 144 2005 Wu et al. 95 6037 6042 1998 .

Reagents All chemicals were of analytical grade. Restriction enzymes DNA modifying enzymes T4 ligase and T7 DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Beverly Mass. . Custom oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon Huntsville Ala. . Streptavidin magnetic beads were purchased from Dynal Lake Success N.Y. .

Construction of 3649 Fab phage expression vector Polynucleotides encoding the VH and VK domains of 3649 anti CD19 antibody were cloned into an M13 based phage expression vector that facilitates the expression of Fab fragments under the control of the lacZ promoter Dall Acqua et al. 36 43 60 2005 . The vector comprises the first constant region of the human 1 heavy chain the constant domain of a human kappa light chain and two annealing sites for the cloning of VH and VK genes. Cloning was carried out by hybridization mutagenesis Kunkel et al. 82 4778 82 1985 as described in Wu An 207 213 33 2003 . Briefly polynucleotides encoding the VH and VK region of 3649 were amplified using approximately 0.5 pmol of each of the following gene specific oligonucleotide primers 3649 VH Fab Fw SEQ ID NO 128 3649 VH Fab Rev SEQ ID NO 129 3649 VK Fab Fw SEQ ID NO 130 and 3649 VK Fab Rev SEQ ID NO 131 see Table 32 . The 5 nucleotide sequence of each primer comprises M13 vector specific sequences to allow for annealing between the PCR products and the single stranded vector. The nucleotide sequence of 3649 VH Fab Fw SEQ ID NO 128 and 3649 VK Fab Fw SEQ ID NO 130 primers comprises a 28 25 nucleotide sequence respectively corresponding to the M13 gene 3 leader sequence. The 5 nucleotide sequence of 3649 VH Fab Rev SEQ ID NO 129 and 3649 VK Fab Rev SEQ ID NO 131 primers comprises a 28 30 nucleotide sequence corresponding to the first constant region of the human 1 heavy chain and the constant domain of a human kappa light chain respectively. Forward primers 3649 VH Fab Fw SEQ ID NO 128 and 3649 VK Fab Fw SEQ ID NO 130 were biotinylated to aid the isolation of the minus strand of the PCR fragments. Polynucleotides encoding the 3649 VH and VK genes were PCR amplified from the corresponding 3649 IgG expression constructs described above using the 3649 VH Fab Fw SEQ ID NO 128 3649 VH Fab Rev SEQ ID NO 129 and 3649 VK Fab Fw SEQ ID NO 130 3649 VK Fab Rev SEQ ID NO 131 primer combinations respectively. PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis electroelution and subsequently phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase Roche . The minus strand of the PCR fragments was isolated by dissociating the double stranded PCR product with sodium hydroxide depleting the plus biotinylated strand using streptavidin coated magnetic beads and recovering the minus strands by ethanol precipitation. Equimolar amounts of the isolated minus strand of VH and VK PCR fragments were annealed to the uridinylated single strand M13 MD101 5A template and treated with T4 DNA polymerase Roche T4 DNA ligase Roche following the manufacturer s instructions. The M13 specific nucleotide sequences incorporated into the isolated VH and VK minus strand polynucleotides specifically anneal them to two separate regions of the M13 vector DNA each of which contain a palindromic loop comprising a recognition site for the Xba I restriction endonuclease. Because the palindromic loops self anneal even in the presence of annealed VH or VK sequences XbaI digestion of the annealed T4 DNA polymerase T4 DNA ligase treated DNA complexes allows for the selection of newly synthesized minus vector strands comprising both VH and VK domains fused in frame with the human kappa K constant and first human 1 constant regions respectively at the expense of the digested parental template plus strand. The reaction product was digested with XbaI heat inactivated and electroporated into DH10B cells. Transformed DH10B cells were titered on bacterial plates with an XL 1 Blue lawn. Phage DNA isolated from several independent plaques was sequenced to aid the identification of a clone encoding the 3649 Fab fragment.

Generation of single CDR focused Fab libraries Two separate single amino acid substitution libraries were prepared for each of the six CDR regions of the 3649 antibody. The NSS libraries comprised all possible single amino acid substituted variants of a given CDR wherein the substitute amino acid is any one of eight amino acids encoded by the NSS degenerate codon. The NWS libraries comprise all possible single amino acid substituted variants of a given CDR wherein the substitute amino acid is any one of twelve amino acids encoded by the NWS degenerate codon. Individual libraries were prepared by hybridization mutagenesis of the 3649 Fab encoding phage vector described above Kunkel et al. 82 4778 82 1985 Wu An 207 213 33 2003 . Briefly two sets of degenerate minus strand oligonucleotides were prepared for each of the six CDRs. The NSS and NWS sets comprised all possible single codon substitutions of a CDR region with the NSS and NWS respectively degenerate codon. The oligonucleotide sets used for the preparation of the heavy chain CDR1 focused libraries are listed in Table 33 as an example. Each degenerate minus strand oligonucleotide was phosphorylated prior to annealing at a 10 1 molar ratio to a uridinylated single stranded 3649 Fab phage template DNA. The temperature of the annealing reaction was lowered from 95 C. to 55 C. over 1 hour. T4 ligase and T7 DNA polymerase was added to the annealed material and incubated for 1.5 hours at 37 C. The final negative strand synthesis products obtained using different oligonucleotides from a single CDR specific set were pooled the NSS and NWS pools however were maintained separately and screened independently. Typically one l of the pooled negative strand synthesis reaction was electroporated into XL1 Blue for plaque formation on XL1 Blue bacterial lawn. Individual phage clones are eluted 200 l of 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 100 mM NaCl buffer and stored at 4 C. The library may be characterized by sequencing 24 randomly selected phage clones to determine the distribution of mutations within the CDR as well as to calculate the mutagenesis rate.

Primary screen of the single CDR focused Fab libraries The primary screen consisted of a single point ELISA SPE performed using the secreted Fab containing supernatant of 1 ml phage cultures and recombinant human CD19 expressing 300B4 cells as a capture agent. An exhaustive screen of a library can usually be achieved by testing a number of individual clones that equals three times the size of the library taking into account the rate of mutagenesis. For example exhaustion of a VH CDR1 5 amino acid residues NSS substitution library 8 possible amino acids encoded by the degenerate NSS codon with a 50 mutagenesis rate may be achieved by screening 5 8 2 80 randomly selected individual clones. In the experiment described herein 400 clones were screened however for each library regardless of the CDR length or synthesis efficiency. Supernatant of small scale phage cultures were isolated as described in Wu An 207 213 33 2003 . Briefly 0.75 mL of exponentially growing TG1 cells are inoculated with 75 l of eluted phage stock in the presence of 0.5 mM IPTG and incubated at 37 C. for 1 hr in 96 well plates. The plate cultures are moved to room temperature and grown overnight on an orbital shaker. Bacteria from 0.36 ml of the overnight cultures is collected by filtration through a low protein binding nylon membrane e.g. Silent screen plate from Nalgene and treated on the filter with 200 l of TES buffer 30 mM Tris pH 8.0 2 mM EDTA 20 sucrose with 2 mg ml lysozyme for 10 minutes at room temperature to release the secreted Fab from the periplasmic space. Fab fragment containing extracts are collected by filtration. Fab fragment concentration in the extract is determined using standard assays. 300B4 cell based ELISA was performed as described supra. The parental 3649 Fab expressing phage clone was included in the cell based ELISA assays as a positive control. Relative binding affinity of variant Fab fragments was compared by plotting the ELISA signal against Fab concentration. For example shows the results obtained with 3649 variant Fabs comprising a random single amino acid substitution within VH CDR3. Fabs 4B7 and 4G6 display significantly increased binding affinity to human CD19 expressing 300B4 cells compared to that of the parental 3649 Fab.

Secondary screen of the single CDR focused Fab libraries CDR variant Fab clones with a primary screen ELISA signal of at least 10 higher than that of the 3649 parental Fab were re grown at a 15 ml scale and re assayed by the same 300B4 cell based ELISA in duplicate wells to confirm the positive result. 15 ml scale Fab extract were prepared following the protocol described in Wu H. 207 197 212 2003 . Fab concentration was determined using standard assays. 300B4 cell based ELISA was performed as described supra. The 3649 parental Fab was included in the assay as a positive control. Clones with a secondary screen signal of at least 10 higher than that of the 3649 control Fab were sequenced to determine the identity of single amino acid substitutions leading to increased human CD19 antigen binding. Amino acid substitutions identified by sequencing the isolated affinity improved anti CD19 Fab clones are listed in Table 34.

Generation of combinatorial Fab library Two combinatorial libraries comprising all possible combinations of beneficial single amino acid substitutions identified from the CDR focused libraries were generated by hybridization mutagenesis. The first combinatorial library was generated using a set of degenerate oligonucleotides that encoded both the parental 3649 residues as well as the identified beneficial single amino acid substitutions Table 35 . A second combinatorial library was generated using a separate set of degenerate oligonucleotides that encodes only the most beneficial single amino acid substitution residues but not the 3649 parental residues Table 36 . The two libraries were generated and screened separately. Library generation was done as described in Wu H. 207 197 212 2003 Wu An 207 213 33 2003 . Briefly degenerate primer sets were synthesized and phosphorylated. Hybridization mutagenesis was performed by using all primers in a single annealing and synthesis reaction. Library generation testing and screening was performed as described supra. The ELISA profile of the six combinatorial Fab clones with the highest binding affinity for human recombinant CD19 expressing 300B4 cells is shown in . Clone 7E12 was recovered from the first combinatorial library generated with degenerate oligonucleotides encoding both the parental and beneficial CDR substitution residues. Clones 14H5 15D7 15D1 16C9 and 16C4 were recovered from the second combinatorial library generated with degenerate oligonucleotides encoding only the most beneficial CDR substitution residues. All phage clones listed in were sequenced to determine the amino acid sequence of the variant CDR regions with increased human CD19 binding affinity.

Polynucleotides encoding the variable regions of 7E12 14H5 15D7 15D1 16C9 and 16C4 Fab variants with improved anti CD19 binding activity were PCR amplified from the corresponding V region encoding M13 phage vectors using pfu DNA polymerase see Dall Acqua et al. 36 43 60 2005 . The polynucleotides were then individually cloned into mammalian expression vectors encoding a human cytomegalovirus major immediate early hCMVie enhancer promoter and 5 untranslated region M. Boshart et al. 41 521 530 1985 . In this system a human 1 chain is secreted along with a human chain S. Johnson et al. 176 1215 1224 1997 . The different constructs were expressed transiently in HEK 293 cells and harvested 72 and 144 hours post transfection. The secreted soluble human IgG1s were purified from the conditioned media directly using 1 ml HiTrap protein A columns according to the manufacturer s instructions APBiotech Inc. Piscataway N.J. .

The ability of 7E12 14H5 15D7 15D1 16C9 and 16C4 IgG antibodies to bind human CD19 was assessed in a cell based CD19 binding assays. Three different cell lines were used as capture reagents i human recombinant CD19 expressing 300B4 cells ii Raji cells and iii Daudi cells . All three cell lines were cultured according to standard protocols. A standard ELISA procedure can be used for the cell based CD19 binding assay. For example individual wells of a 96 well U bottom plate are seeded with 1 10e5 300B4 cells and incubated overnight. Cells are washed once with ELISA buffer prior to incubation on ice with various amounts of anit CD19 antibodies. Binding reactions are performed in triplicates for each antibody concentration tested. Positive control wells using 3649 anti CD19 antibody are included in the assay. Following incubation with the antibody 300B4 cells are washed three times with 200 micro liter of ELISA buffer. Cell surface bound anti CD19 antibodies are detected using a goat anti human kappa antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase according to standard protocols.

For example afucosylated 16C4 antibody 16C4 aFuc mediated ADCC was measured using Daudi target cells . The experiments also included 16C4 3649 aFuc and anti CD20 antibodies as reference controls. ADCC of 16C4 aFuc is significantly higher than that of the 3649 aFuc anti CD20 or fucosylated 16C4 reference antibodies. ADCC mediated by 16C4 aFuc is comparable to that of the antibodies.

In vitro ADCC activity of 16C4 16C4 aFuc and 3649 aFuc anti CD19 antibodies were further characterized in a standardized in vitro ADCC assay using a variety of target cells. An anti CD20 antibody was included in the assay as a control. Target cells used represent a variety of B cell malignancies as well as different CD19 cell surface densities Table 37 . Relative surface expression of CD19 and CD20 of the target cells was determined by flow cytometry following standard protocols. Table 37 lists the mean fluorescence intensity MFI of target cells stained with fluorescently labeled anti CD20 or 16C4 anti CD19 antibodies. ADCC reactions were performed following the protocols described above. Reactions were set up in triplicates using 50 000 effector cells and 20 000 target cells to achieve an E T ratio of 2.5 1. Transgenic NK cells expressing CD16 and associated signaling polypeptide FC RI served as effector cells. ADCC reactions were allowed to proceed for 4 hours at 37 C. ADCC activity was determined at various antibody concentrations. Data was plotted as cytotoxicity as a function of antibody concentration. Maximum cell killing and EC50 values antibody concentrations required for half maximum cytotoxicity under the conditions used were established for target cell antibody combinations using standard methods. Table 37 presents the final results. Oci LY19 KArpas 422 Nalm 6 and Namalwa cells representing DLCL NHL ALL and Burkitt s lymphoma respectively were sensitive to 16C4 aFuc antibodymediated cytotoxicity but largely not sensitive to anti CD20 mediated ADCC. Daudi Toledo RL and Raji cells were significantly more sensitive to 16C4 aFuc antibody medited cytotoxicity than to anti CD20 mediated ADCC.

The CFSE profile shows that 23.5 26.5 23.2 73.2 of the B cells underwent at least one round of cell division. and C shows the CFSE profile of B cells stimulated with anti IgM 1 g ml CpG 2 g ml in the presence of 3649 TM and 3649 3M Fc variant anti CD19 antibody respectively. The CFSE profiles show that 44.8 and 30.3 of B cells stimulated in the presence of 3649 TM and 3649 3M Fc variant anti CD19 antibody respectively underwent at least one round of cell division during the four day long incubation period. Closer inspection of all three CFSE profiles reveals that not only the number of cells undergoing at least one division but also the number of cells undergoing more than one divisions drops with highest and lowest cell proliferation seen in the presence of R347 and 3649 3M respectively. Treatment with 3649 TM inhibits cell proliferation less effectively than treatment with 3649 3M.

Purified B cells were stimulated for four days with anti IgM 5 g ml CpG 1 g ml in the presence of 5 g ml R347 R347 3M Fc variant 3649 3649 3M Fc variant or 3649 TM Fc variant antibodies. Cell proliferation is assessed using the CFSE assay. CFSE profile of B cells stimulated in the presence of R347 is included in all panels as a reference standard. CFSE profiles of B cells stimulated in the presence of R347 3M Fc variant 3649 3649 3M Fc variant and 3649 TM Fc variant antibodies is shown in panels A D. Cell proliferation in the presence of R347 3M Fc variant is same as the one seen in the presence of the R347 reference standard. Cell proliferation is inhibited by all three anti CD19 antibodies. The wild type 3649 and 3649 TM Fc variant antibodies inhibited cell proliferation to the same extent. 3649 3M was more effective at inhibiting B cell proliferation than either the 3649 or 3649 TM antibodies.

Inhibitory synergism of anti CD19 and anti Fcgamma receptor IIB Fc RIIb or CD32b antibodies The following experimental design will further test whether there is a synergistic interaction between the anti CD32b and anti CD19 antibody mediated inhibitions of B cell proliferation. Purified B cells will be stimulated for four days with anti IgM 2 g ml CpG 2 g ml in the presence of i an anti CD32b antibody e.g. AT10 ii an anti CD19 antibody or iii both anti CD32b and CD19 antibodies. Cell proliferation will be assessed using the CFSE assay. Synergism between anti CD32b and anti CD19 antibody mediated inhibition of B cell proliferation is expected to lead to lower B cell proliferation in the presence of both antibodies than the cell proliferation seen in the presence of either antibody alone.

Antibody internalization assay Cells are incubated with 5 g ml Alexa Flour 488 labeled antibodies at 37 C. for up to 60 minutes. An aliquot of cells are removed at 10 minute intervals washed divided into two parts and placed on ice. One half aliquot is left untreated on ice. The second half aliquot is treated on ice for 45 seconds with a low pH 2.0 PBS solution containing 0.03M sucrose and 10 FCS to strip all cell surface bound antibody molecules. Both acid treated and untreated samples are washed fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a flow cytometer. internalized antibody is calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence signal of acid washed cells internal signal only and that of untreated cells total signal from cell surface and internal compartments .

Cells are incubated in the presence of an anti CD19 antibody for 24 hours. A control cell population is incubated in the presence of the R347 antibody of irrelevant specificity. Following incubation cells are harvested washed and incubated on ice for 10 minutes in a staining solution comprising 5 g ml anti CD19 antibody for 10 minutes. Surface bound anti CD19 antibody is detected by staining the cells for 10 minutes with a PE conjugated goat anti human IgG secondary antibody. Immunostained cells are fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a flow cytometer. CD19 surface loss is calculated by comparing the mean fluorescence intensity MFI of anti CD19 antibody treated cells to the MFI of immunostained R347 treated cells 0 surface loss and secondary antibody only stained R347 treated cells 100 surface loss .
