The present invention pertains to the technical field of aqueous suspensions of mineral materials involved in manufacturing sheets of paper.

When manufacturing a coated sheet of paper a first step consists in converting the papermaking pulp by means of the papermaking machine into a sheet of paper which is not yet coated. The papermaking pulp essentially contains natural cellulose fibers or synthetic fibers water and one or more mineral materials such as calcium carbonate as well as various other additives such as so called pasting agents. A mineral material such as calcium carbonate used in such situations is referred to as a filler . The second step resides in coating the previously obtained sheet. This operation consists in applying to the base paper medium an aqueous compound known as a paper coating which particularly contains water one or more mineral materials such as calcium carbonate one or more binders and various additives. When manufacturing a paper coating a mineral material such as calcium carbonate that is used is referred to as a coating pigment.

After being applied to the medium the paper coating has a natural tendency to transfer some or all of the water soluble or suspended substances that it contains into the medium. The slowing down of this migration into the paper medium is necessary in order to maintain a homogeneous distribution of water soluble or suspended substances within the thickness of the paper coating thereby applied which ultimately improves the paper s surface condition and printability.

In seeking to resolve the particular technical problem of slowing the penetration of a paper coating into a sheet of paper though without preventing it from occurring with the goal being to maintain a homogeneous distribution of water soluble or suspended substances within the thickness of the paper coating thereby applied persons skilled in the art have identified two possible technologies 

There are a number of documents dealing with the problem of maximizing a sheet of paper s hydrophobicity with respect to water as may be desired for paper which must withstand particularly high humidity conditions or with respect to ink as may notably be sought for paper intended to be printed with water based and particularly acidic inks . These documents therefore focus on the penetration of liquids such as water or inks whose formula differs from that of a paper coating. Additionally they generally rely on extremely simple tests which involve measuring the time it takes for water or an ink to pass through a sheet of paper. Such tests would be wholly unsuitable at highlighting the technical problem covered by the present application 

As explained above only the technology implemented in the tests given herein can provide an understanding of the phenomena described hereinabove.

Consequently the documents dealing with the problem of maximizing the hydrophobicity of a sheet of paper with respect to water or ink therefore solve very different problems than the one which forms the object of the present application. If the Applicant mentions these documents anyway this is done merely to demonstrate that the person skilled in the art even if he had chosen to refer to said documents which no objective elements could lead him to consider because said documents do not treat the technical problem that he wishes to solve would have found no information disclosing or suggesting the technical solution which is the object of the present application.

Thus in order to increase the hydrophobicity of a sheet of paper with respect to water or ink the person skilled in the art is familiar with several solutions which may be divided into three categories during their use in manufacturing a sheet of paper 

In the first category the person skilled in the art is familiar with the document JP 06 219038 which describes a paper containing pulp a mineral material such as calcium carbonate and a penetration inhibiting agent that inhibits the penetration of ink and therefore of water soluble substance. Such an agent is particularly chosen from among hydrophilic resins such as casein and starch as well as from among copolymers which have both a hydrophilic part and a hydrophobic part such as copolymers of maleic anhydride and styrene.

In this category he is also familiar with the document SU 1 263 739 which describes the usage of an agent that makes the sheet of paper hydrophobic such as a wax in combination with a mineral material suspension such as calcium carbonate and papermaking pulp in a method for manufacturing a sheet of paper.

As stated in document WO 96 23105 conventional pasting agents of the type which are resins with aluminum sulfates or those which are based on ketene dimers exhibit hydrophobic properties which will limit the penetration of water and water soluble substances into the paper within which said pasting agents are used. This document even discloses the combination of using these pasting agents with a colloidal polymer for the purposes of improving the hydrophobicity of the sheet of paper

Finally the third category of solutions relies upon the implementation of a mineral material such as calcium carbonate said material being treated or mixed with an organic polymer.

In this category the person skilled in the art is familiar with the document U.S. Pat. No. 5 514 212 which describes the treatment of the surface of a calcium carbonate through precipitation in the presence of a compound of starch and fatty acids having 16 to 18 carbon atoms. A calcium carbonate modified in this manner is used as an aqueous suspension in manufacturing a sheet of paper. This document indicates that the quantity of pasting agents used in manufacturing a sheet of paper may thereby be reduced. It also mentions that the sheet of paper s degree of hydrophobicity is thereby improved. This level of hydrophobicity is determined using acidic water based ink penetration measurements this is a test well known to the person skilled in the art as a Hercules Sizing Test or HST consisting of determining the time needed for a standardized water based ink containing formic acid to pass through a sheet of paper. The objective of this test is therefore to determine a paper s resistance to water based acidic inks which are intended to be printed upon said paper afterwards. Additionally the examples given in this document only pertain to uncoated sheets of paper. Consequently there is no information in document U.S. Pat. No. 5 514 212 that reveals or suggests that the use of calcium carbonates treated using the method described therein slows the penetration of a paper coating into the sheet of paper and leads to an even distribution of water soluble or suspended substances throughout the thickness of the paper coating applied to the paper.

The person skilled in the art is also familiar with the document WO 01 86067 which describes a method for treating a mineral material such as calcium carbonate using an acrylate acrylonitrile and styrene based hydrophobic polymer polymerized in the presence of starch polysaccharide or carboxymethylcellulose. Said polymer is mixed with said mineral material in the form of an aqueous solution or suspension with this solution or suspension later being used in the manufacturing of a sheet of paper whose degree of hydrophobicity is thereby improved. As with the previous document the examples do not pertain to coated sheets of paper. Furthermore these examples consist of rudimentary HST tests.

Finally the person skilled in the art is also familiar with the document WO 00 03093 which describes a method for manufacturing a sheet of paper using a mineral material such as calcium carbonate in the form of an aqueous suspension further containing a copolymer combining acrylonitrile with another monomer such as styrene with this copolymer giving the calcium carbonate a hydrophobic function. In this document it is indicated that the calcium carbonate and the copolymer are mixed in the water. The calcium carbonate thereby used in manufacturing the sheet of paper grants said sheet improved hydrophobicity. As with the two previous documents the examples consist of simple ink penetration measurements using the HST test. Additionally the sheets of paper are uncoated.

Consequently none of these documents reveals or suggests using in a method for manufacturing a sheet of paper an aqueous suspension or dispersion of mineral materials as an agent for slowing the penetration of a paper coating into said sheet said dispersion and or suspension characterized in that it contains at least one water soluble copolymer made up of 

One of the Applicant s innovations particularly relies on the fact that she has noted that mineral materials 

Without wishing to bound to any theory whatsoever the Applicant thinks that the mineral material particularly when it is ground and or dispersed with said copolymer then when it is used in manufacturing the sheet of paper will develop properties of slowing the penetration of a paper coating into said sheet this property is particularly illustrated in the tests herein using an original technique of tracking the penetration of the paper coating into the sheet by means of ultrasound during the first tenths of a second after the paper coating has come into contact with the paper medium. It is thereby demonstrated that entirely advantageously the present invention leads to the slowing of the penetration of the paper coating into the sheet of paper which results in an even distribution of water soluble or suspended substances throughout the thickness of the paper coating applied to the paper.

The Applicant wishes to indicate that she is however familiar with a number of documents dealing with aqueous suspensions of mineral materials which are treated dispersed or ground particularly with water soluble polymers comprising a hydrophobic group and used as fillers i.e. in the manufacturing of a sheet of paper. By indicating such documents she intends to emphasize that they do not in any way pertain to the technical problem covered herein to that end the person skilled in the art cannot find therein any objective instruction that would lead him to the technical solution which is the object hereof.

Thus with respect to mineral materials used as fillers said materials being treated the person skilled in the art is familiar with the document JP 2003 166195. This document describes the treatment of a mineral material used in an aqueous suspension in manufacturing paper using an organic compound mixed with said mineral material. This organic compound has both a hydrophilic portion and a hydrophobic portion said hydrophobic portion being made up of an alkyl or alkenyl group having 6 to 24 carbon atoms. The use of an aqueous suspension of mineral materials thereby treated in the manufacturing of paper leads to an increase in the sheet of paper s thickness which is a very different problem from the one solved by the present invention.

With respect to mineral materials dispersed in an aqueous medium and used as fillers the person skilled in the art is familiar with the document U.S. Pat. No. 4 801 354. This document describes the use as a mineral material dispersing agent of a copolymer having a Fikentscher K value from 10 to 65 and made up of a meth acrylic ester and an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid preferentially isobutylacrylate whose water solubility is very low 0.2 g in 100 g of water . The aqueous suspensions of mineral materials thereby dispersed such as calcium carbonate are used in manufacturing the sheet of paper where they make it possible to limit the quantity of mineral load retaining agents which the present invention does not seek to solve.

Finally with respect to mineral materials dispersed or ground in an aqueous medium the person skilled in the art is familiar with the document EP 0 892 020. This document describes the use of a copolymer as a dispersing agent and or grinding aid agent for mineral materials in an aqueous suspension characterized in that said copolymer is a copolymer with a specific viscosity no greater than 50 and made up of at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer with a carboxylic function and at least one ethylenically unsaturated oxylalkylated monomer terminating in a hydrophobic chain.

The technical problem solved by this document is the search for a polymer that may be used as both a mineral material dispersing and or grinding agent no matter whether such materials are hydrophilic such as calcium carbonate or hydrophobic such as talc. Although document EP 0 892 020 indicates that the mineral materials thereby obtained may be used as fillers there are no examples concerning such usage. Moreover there is no information in that document revealing or suggesting the use of mineral materials ground in an aqueous suspension and used as fillers with the particular function of slowing the penetration of a paper coating into the sheet of paper.

Thus a first object of the invention is the use in a method for manufacturing a sheet of paper of an aqueous dispersion and or suspension of mineral materials as an agent for slowing the penetration of the paper coating into said sheet characterized in that said dispersion and or suspension contains at least one water soluble copolymer made up of 

This use is further characterized in that said water soluble copolymer is used during at least one step of grinding and or dispersing said mineral materials in an aqueous medium.

Naturally the person skilled in the art may use in combination with said copolymer another agent with which he is familiar for grinding and or dispersing mineral materials.

This use is further characterized in that the radical R is chosen from among the radical tristyrylphenyl or from among dialkylamines with at least 8 carbon atoms or from among linear or branched alkyl alkylaryl arylalkyl and aryl groups with at least 8 carbon atoms preferentially 10 to 24 carbon atoms very preferentially from 16 to 20 carbon atoms each with two branches having at least six carbon atoms or mixtures of these radicals and in that the radical R is extremely preferentially chosen from among 2 hexyl 1 decanyl and 2 octyl 1 dodecanyl or mixtures thereof.

When choosing the copolymer described above the present invention is not limited solely to the presence of the two monomers a and b although these two monomers remain essential to the composition of said copolymer. To that end the present application is further characterized in that in addition to at least one a monomer and at least one b monomer said copolymer further contains at least one other monomer chosen from among an acrylamide or methacrylamide monomer or derivatives thereof such as N 3 dimethylamino propyl acrylamide or N 3 dimethylamino propyl methacrylamide and mixtures thereof or from among a non water soluble monomer such as alkyl acrylates or methacrylates unsaturated esters such as N 2 dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate or N 2 dimethylamino ethyl acrylate vinylics such as vinyl acetate vinylpyrrolidone styrene alphamethylstyrene and derivatives thereof or from among a cationic or quaternary ammonium monomer such as preferentially 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride 3 acrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride dimethyl diallyl ammonium sulfate or chloride 3 methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride or from among an organofluorated or organosililated monomer or from among those cross linking monomers i.e. monomers with at least two ethylene unsaturations that are well known to the person skilled in the art or mixtures of these monomers.

The present application is further characterized in that said water soluble copolymer is made up of each of the following components expressed as a percentage by weight 

This use is further characterized in that said water soluble copolymer is obtained by radical polymerization methods in a solution in a direct or inverse emulsion in a suspension or precipitation in solvents in the presence of catalytic systems and transfer agents or by controlled radical polymerization methods and preferentially by nitroxide mediated polymerization NMP or cobaloxyme mediated polymerization by atom transfer radical polymerization ATRP by sulfur derivative controlled radical polymerization said sulfur derivatives being chosen from among carbamates dithioesters trithiocarbonates RAFT or xanthates.

This use is further characterized in that said water soluble copolymer obtained in an acidic and potentially distilled form may also be fully or partially neutralized by one or more neutralization agents having a monovalent or polyvalent function chosen from the group made up of alkaline cations and preferentially from among sodium potassium or ammonium or chosen from among the group made up of primary secondary or tertiary aliphatic and or cyclical amines and preferentially from among stearylamine ethanolamines mono di and triethanolamine mono and diethylamine cyclohexylamine and methylcyclohexylamine or chosen from the group made up of divalent alkaline earth cations and preferentially from among magnesia calcium and zinc or chosen from the group made up by trivalent cations and preferentially aluminum.

Each neutralization agent then becomes involved in accordance with neutralization rates specific to each valence function.

In another variant the copolymer resulting from the copolymerization reaction may potentially before or after the total or partial neutralization be treated and separated into multiple phases in accordance with static or dynamic methods known to the person skilled in the art by one or more polar solvents preferentially belonging to the group made up of water methanol ethanol propanol isopropanol butanols acetone tetrahydrofurane or mixtures thereof.

One of the phases corresponds to the copolymer used in accordance with the invention as a grinding aid agent for mineral materials in an aqueous suspension.

This use is further characterized in that it uses a quantity of said water soluble copolymer from 0.1 to 3 preferentially from 0.2 to 1.5 and very preferentially 0.3 to 1 by dry weight compared with the total dry weight of the mineral materials.

This use is also characterized in that the dispersion and or aqueous suspension of mineral materials contains at least 10 preferentially at least 20 very preferentially at least 50 and extremely preferentially at least 70 by dry weight of mineral materials compared with its total weight.

This use is finally characterized in that said mineral materials are chosen from natural or synthetic calcium carbonate dolomites limestone kaolin talc gypsum lime magnesia titanium dioxide satin white aluminum trioxide or aluminum trihydroxide silicas mica and the mixture of these charges such as mixtures of talc calcium carbonate calcium carbonate kaolin or mixtures of calcium carbonate with aluminum trihydroxide or aluminum trioxide or mixtures with synthetic or natural fibers or co structures of minerals such as talc calcium carbonate or talc titanium dioxide co structures or mixtures thereof and in that said mineral materials are preferably chosen from natural or synthetic calcium carbonate or talc or mixtures thereof and in that they are very preferably chosen from natural or synthetic calcium carbonate or mixtures thereof.

Another object of the present invention is a method for manufacturing a sheet of paper from a papermaking pulp characterized in that said pulp is derived from a step of mixing natural and or synthetic fibers water and an aqueous suspension and or dispersion of mineral materials containing a water soluble copolymer made up of 

Naturally the person skilled in the art may use other additives with which he is familiar and which are generally involved in manufacturing a sheet of paper in this method.

This method is further characterized in that in addition to at least one a monomer and at least one b monomer said copolymer further contains at least one other monomer chosen from among an acrylamide or methacrylamide monomer or derivatives thereof such as N 3 dimethylamino propyl acrylamide or N 3 dimethylamino propyl methacrylamide and mixtures thereof or from among a non water soluble monomer such as alkyl acrylates or methacrylates unsaturated esters such as N 2 dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate or N 2 dimethylamino ethyl acrylate vinylics such as vinyl acetate vinylpyrrolidone styrene alphamethylstyrene and derivatives thereof or from among a cationic or quaternary ammonium monomer such as preferentially 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride 3 acrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride dimethyl diallyl ammonium sulfate or chloride 3 methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride or from among an organofluorated or organosililated monomer or from among those cross linking monomers i.e. monomers with at least two ethylene unsaturations that are well known to the person skilled in the art or mixtures of these monomers.

This method is further characterized in that said water soluble copolymer is obtained by radical polymerization methods in a solution in a direct or inverse emulsion in a suspension or precipitation in solvents in the presence of catalytic systems and transfer agents or by controlled radical polymerization methods and preferentially by nitroxide mediated polymerization NMP or cobaloxyme mediated polymerization by atom transfer radical polymerization ATRP by sulfur derivative controlled radical polymerization said sulfur derivatives being chosen from among carbamates dithioesters trithiocarbonates RAFT or xanthates.

This method is further characterized in that said water soluble copolymer obtained in an acidic and potentially distilled form may also be fully or partially neutralized by one or more neutralization agents having a monovalent or polyvalent function chosen from the group made up of alkaline cations and preferentially from among sodium potassium or ammonium or chosen from among the group made up of primary secondary or tertiary aliphatic and or cyclical amines and preferentially from among stearylamine ethanolamines mono di and triethanolamine mono and diethylamine cyclohexylamine and methylcyclohexylamine or chosen from the group made up of divalent alkaline earth cations and preferentially from among magnesia calcium and zinc or chosen from the group made up by trivalent cations and preferentially aluminum.

Each neutralization agent then becomes involved in accordance with neutralization rates specific to each valence function.

This method is further characterized in that the copolymer resulting from the copolymerization reaction may potentially before or after the total or partial neutralization be treated and separated into multiple phases in accordance with static or dynamic methods known to the person skilled in the art by one or more polar solvents preferentially belonging to the group made up of water methanol ethanol propanol isopropanol butanols acetone tetrahydrofurane or mixtures thereof.

One of the phases corresponds to the copolymer used in accordance with the invention as a grinding aid agent for mineral materials in an aqueous suspension.

These sheets are further characterized in that in addition to at least one a monomer and at least one b monomer said copolymer further contains at least one other monomer chosen from among an acrylamide or methacrylamide monomer or derivatives thereof such as N 3 dimethylamino propyl acrylamide or N 3 dimethylamino propyl methacrylamide and mixtures thereof or from among a non water soluble monomer such as alkyl acrylates or methacrylates unsaturated esters such as N 2 dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate or N 2 dimethylamino ethyl acrylate vinylics such as vinyl acetate vinylpyrrolidone styrene alphamethylstyrene and derivatives thereof or from among a cationic or quaternary ammonium monomer such as preferentially 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride 3 acrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride dimethyl diallyl ammonium sulfate or chloride 3 methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate or chloride or from among an organofluorated or organosililated monomer or from among those cross linking monomers i.e. monomers with at least two ethylene unsaturations that are well known to the person skilled in the art or mixtures of these monomers.

These sheets are further characterized in that said water soluble copolymer obtained in an acidic and potentially distilled form may also be fully or partially neutralized by one or more neutralization agents having a monovalent or polyvalent function chosen from the group made up of alkaline cations and preferentially from among sodium potassium or ammonium or chosen from among the group made up of primary secondary or tertiary aliphatic and or cyclical amines and preferentially from among stearylamine ethanolamines mono di and triethanolamine mono and diethylamine cyclohexylamine and methylcyclohexylamine or chosen from the group made up of divalent alkaline earth cations and preferentially from among magnesia calcium and zinc or chosen from the group made up by trivalent cations and preferentially aluminum.

Each neutralization agent then becomes involved in accordance with neutralization rates specific to each valence function.

One of the phases corresponds to the copolymer used in accordance with the invention as a grinding aid agent for mineral materials in an aqueous suspension.

These sheets are further characterized in that said mineral materials are chosen from natural or synthetic calcium carbonate dolomites limestone kaolin talc gypsum lime magnesia titanium dioxide satin white aluminum trioxide or aluminum trihydroxide silicas mica and the mixture of these loads such as mixtures of talc calcium carbonate calcium carbonate kaolin or mixtures of calcium carbonate with aluminum trihydroxide or aluminum trioxide or mixtures with synthetic or natural fibers or co structures of minerals such as talc calcium carbonate or talc titanium dioxide co structures or mixtures thereof and in that said mineral materials are preferably chosen from natural or synthetic calcium carbonate or talc or mixtures thereof and in that they are very preferably chosen from natural or synthetic calcium carbonate or mixtures thereof.

The examples that follow make it possible to better understand the benefits of the invention though without limiting its scope.

The purpose of this example is to illustrate the use when manufacturing a sheet of paper of an aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate ground with a copolymer in accordance with the invention.

This example also demonstrates that such a use makes it possible to slow the penetration of a paper coating into said sheet compared with a sheet containing a calcium carbonate with a grinding agent as found in the prior art.

For each of the tests nos. 1 to 4 first an aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate is prepared through grinding in accordance with the methods well known to a person skilled in the art especially as indicated in the document FR 2 846 978 either in the presence of a grinding aid agent as found in the prior art tests nos. 1 and 2 or in the presence of a copolymer in accordance with the invention tests nos. 3 to 4 .

Second for each of the tests nos. 1 to 4 handsheet molds i.e. sheets of paper are created from a thermo mechanical pulp 100 whitened with hydrogen peroxide and an aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate obtained in accordance with each of the tests nos. 1 to 4 so that the percentage of calcium carbonate by dry weight in the handsheet mold is equal to 8 of its total weight. The handsheet mold is created using a Rapid K then laboratory device.

Fifth and lastly the penetration speed of this paper coating into the handsheet mold sheet of paper is measured using an EMTEC PDA C2 device sold by the company EMTEC . This device makes it possible to dynamically determine the penetration of a liquid into a medium such as paper using ultrasound.

This device operates as follows an ultrasound signal is used to quantify the interactions between paper and liquid. The paper coating penetrating into the paper changes the ultrasound transmission and thereby the intensity read at the receiver. This change in intensity over time is represented on a graph of Intensity over Time s .

The interaction between the paper coating and the medium is determined by the surface s structure in particular by its porous structure but also the quality of the paper coating.

The ideal curve after the sheet comes into contact with the paper coating reaches a peak during the first few milliseconds 1phase and then slowly decreases 2phase .

Consequently comparing the intensity over time curves for the various handsheet molds containing the various aqueous suspensions of calcium carbonate makes it possible to determine which handsheet molds and therefore which aqueous suspensions lead to the best paper coating penetration resistance.

This test illustrates the prior art and uses as a grinding aid agent 0.45 by dry weight in relation to the calcium carbonate s dry weight of a fully neutralized acrylic acid homopolymer.

This table shows that the characteristics of the aqueous suspensions of calcium carbonate obtained in accordance with the invention are compatible with a use as fillers in terms of solids content particle size distribution and Brookfield viscosities .

The intensity over time curves for tests no. 1 to 4 have been shown in FIG. . Examining this figure clearly shows that the handsheet molds created with an aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate ground in accordance with the invention lead to higher intensities and therefore to a significant slowing in the penetration of the paper coating over time.

The purpose of this example is to illustrate the use when manufacturing a sheet of paper of an aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate ground with a copolymer in accordance with the invention.

This example also demonstrates that such a use makes it possible to slow the penetration of a paper coating into said sheet compared with a sheet containing a calcium carbonate with a grinding agent as found in the prior art.

For each of the tests nos. 5 to 16 first an aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate is prepared through grinding in accordance with the methods well known to a person skilled in the art especially as indicated in the document FR 2 846 978 either in the presence of a grinding aid agent as found in the prior art tests nos. 5 to 7 or in the presence of a copolymer according to the invention tests nos. 8 to 16 .

In the same manner as for example 1 first a paper handsheet mold and then a paper coating is created with a composition identical to that of example 1 and the penetration of each paper coating into the handsheet mold in accordance with the protocol used in example 1 is tracked.

The characteristics of the aqueous suspensions of calcium carbonate created for tests nos. 5 to 16 solids content Brookfield viscosities measured at 10 and 100 revolutions per minute at the moment t 0 and at t 8 days after agitation and their particle size distribution as measured by a Sedigraph 5100 sold by the company MICROMERITICS are given in Table 3.

Table 3 shows that the characteristics of the inventive aqueous suspensions make them entirely suitable for handling as well as compatible with a use for manufacturing paper coatings.

For each of the tests the value of the intensity measured with an EMTEC device was recorded at the moments t 0.1 0.5 and 1 second. The results appear in Table 4.

The intensity is always higher for the invention than for the prior art regardless of when the measurement is taken. This clearly shows that there is less air trapped in the experiments implementing the invention the paper coating is slowed down when penetrating into the paper handsheet mold.

The purpose of this example is to illustrate the use when manufacturing a sheet of paper of an aqueous dispersion of calcium carbonate dispersed with a copolymer in accordance with the invention.

This example also demonstrates that such a use makes it possible to slow the penetration of a paper coating into said sheet compared with a sheet containing a calcium carbonate with a dispersing agent as found in the prior art.

For each of the tests nos. 17 to 19 first an aqueous dispersion of calcium carbonate is prepared by thermically concentrating a cake of calcium carbonate with an initial solids content equal to 40 of its total weight into one with a solids content greater than 50 of its dry weight in the presence of a dispersing agent as found in the prior art or in accordance with the invention.

In the same manner as for example 1 first a paper handsheet mold and then a paper coating is created with a composition identical to that of example 1 and the penetration of each paper coating into the handsheet mold in accordance with the protocol used in example 1 is tracked.

This test illustrates the prior art and uses as a dispersing agent 0.60 by dry weight in relation to the calcium carbonate s dry weight of a copolymer of acrylic acid and maleic anhydride.

This test illustrates the invention and uses as a dispersing agent 0.60 by dry weight in relation to the calcium carbonate s dry weight of a fully neutralized water soluble copolymer made up of

The characteristics of the aqueous dispersions of calcium carbonate created for tests nos. 17 to 19 solids content Brookfield viscosities measured at 10 and 100 revolutions per minute at t 0 and t 8 days after agitation are given in Table 5.

Table 5 shows that the characteristics of the inventive aqueous suspensions make them entirely suitable for handling as well as compatible with a use for manufacturing paper coatings.

For each of the tests the value of the intensity measured with an EMTEC device was recorded at the moments t 0.1 0.5 and 1 second. The results appear in Table 6.

The intensity is always higher for the invention than for the prior art regardless of when the measurement is taken. This clearly shows that there is less air trapped in the experiments implementing the invention the paper coating is slowed down when penetrating into the paper handsheet mold.
