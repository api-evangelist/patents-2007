This invention relates generally to the field of telecommunications and more specifically to the field of authentication of mobile devices.

Modern distributed networks often span multiple network mediums and provide a user with access to information and services hosted by a multitude of network resources. For example it is not uncommon for a remote user to be accessing an on line banking service a corporate network or stream digital media from a remote server connected to the Internet. The resulting interchange of sensitive data and access to premium or protected information necessitate effective user authentication prior to granting access to protected resources.

In general authentication involves verification of user s identity by matching the information that originates from the user s knowledge an article in user s possession or a user s personal attribute. Authentication via information known to the user typically involves matching a user supplied password a personal identification number PIN or a pass phrase. Typical examples of authentication via an article in the user s possession and via a user s personal attribute respectively involve possession of a smartcard of the type used to pay for public transportation and verification of biometric factors such as fingerprints or iris patterns.

Authentication methods that require a single form of authentication for example a password are referred to as one factor authentication. Generally one factor authentication methods differ in degree of security and reliability. For example biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint scanning are relatively expensive to implement and may be prone to scanning errors while manual password entry is subject to key logging attacks. Due to the ever growing security concerns it is becoming increasingly common for authentication systems to require multiple authenticating factors. In a two factor authentication procedure the user provides two sets of authenticating material e.g. two passwords . Two factor authentication is generally deemed to provide stronger security by complicating the would be attacker s task.

Two factor authentication is also increasingly common in a mobile environment where mobile devices including mobile phones are frequently used to access remote server resources connected to the Internet as well as to perform point of sale transactions. However the increase in security associated with multifactor authentication comes at a cost multifactor methods including two factor authentication are generally less convenient for the user than one factor methods due to the increase in the authenticating information required from the user. Each time a user wishes to access privileged content or a privileged service he or she must supply extra authenticating factor s . In the case of dual password authentication the user must remember two separate passwords for example. These issues are further exacerbated in a fast paced mobile environment where a user needs to enter an additional PIN password or pass phrase via a small keyboard or dial pad which is typically an inconvenient and time consuming process. Typical mobile password database applications for example require manual entry of initial login information prior to granting access to the stored password PIN and pass phrase material necessary to access a privileged external resource. Furthermore manual entry of additional authenticating factors does not solve the security risks associated with password PIN and pass phrase theft by nearby on lookers or by key logging malware within the mobile device.

Embodiments of the invention are used to provide user friendly multifactor mobile authentication by way of validation via an external authenticating module that helps prevent unauthorized access to the electronic authenticating material stored on a mobile communications device and removes the need for memorization and manual entry of authenticating information. To gain access to an external resource the mobile communications device preferably performs a two factor authentication procedure by initially authenticating a user via the external authenticating module and subsequently conveying another authenticating factor chosen among the locally stored electronic authenticating material.

The mobile communications device includes a contactless reader for wirelessly receiving and validating a unique identifier stored in the external authenticating module located in its proximity prior to granting access to locally stored electronic authenticating material required by an external resource. In one embodiment the mobile communications device is a mobile telephone having an RFID reader for receiving the unique identifier from an RFID tag incorporated into the external authenticating module. Preferably the external authenticating module is associated with a user such as by being part of or attached to the user s jewelry or clothing.

In embodiments electronic authenticating material stored on the mobile communications device includes one or more of a username and password a pass phrase a personal identification number PIN a digital certificate and or an NFC identifier. The external resources include a secure web server a VPN server and a Near Field Communication NFC device.

The mobile authentication device includes an RFID authenticator module that detects external resource access requests and checks whether the requested resource is on a list of resources that require additional user authentication prior to granting access to locally stored authentication material. If the external resource is on the multifactor authentication list the RFID authenticator module queries the RFID reader for the presence of the external authenticating module and grants access to the locally stored electronic authentication material upon receiving and validating the RFID number from the RFID tag. To validate the user s identity the RFID authenticator module matches the received RFID number with a corresponding number pre programmed in the mobile device s secure memory area. Upon initial user authentication the mobile communications device reads the username password pass phrase or PIN information from its secure memory area and communicates this information to the requested resource via its corresponding communications protocol including HTTP Digest SSL TLS TCP or NFC protocols.

In one aspect of the invention a method is provided for gaining access to an external resource from a mobile communications device wherein the access to the external resource requires a plurality of authenticating factors the method comprising detecting a request to access the external resource requiring authentication via electronic authenticating material stored in the mobile communications device detecting presence of an external authenticating module in proximity to the mobile communications device allowing access to the electronic authenticating material in response to validating a unique identifier received from the external authenticating module as one of the plurality of authenticating factors and communicating information associated with the electronic authenticating material to the external resource as another one of the plurality of authenticating factors.

In another aspect of the invention a mobile communications device is provided for accessing an external resource via a plurality of authenticating factors the mobile communications device comprising a processor memory for storing electronic authenticating material at least one contactless reader capable of receiving a unique identifier to provide access to the electronic authenticating material as one of the plurality of authenticating factors and a communications interface for sending the information associated with the electronic authenticating material to the external resource as another one of the authenticating factors.

In still another aspect of the invention a system is provided for accessing an external resource from a mobile communications device via a plurality of authenticating factors the system comprising the mobile communications device having stored thereon electronic authenticating material the electronic authenticating material comprising one of the plurality of authenticating factors for accessing the external resource an external authenticating module having stored thereon a unique identifier for providing access to the electronic authenticating material in the mobile communications device as another one of the plurality of authenticating factors and wherein the mobile communications device comprises at least one contactless reader for receiving the unique identifier from the external authenticating module when the mobile communications device detects an authentication attempt requiring access to the electronic authenticating material and the external authenticating module is in proximity to the mobile communications device.

The following examples further illustrate the invention but of course should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.

Turning to an implementation of a system contemplated by an embodiment of the invention is shown with reference to a mobile network environment. The mobile communications device collects multiple authenticating factors in order to establish a communications session with one or more external resources . To enhance the user authentication process the mobile communications device includes a contactless reader for automatically collecting and validating a unique identifier stored on an external authenticating module located in its proximity prior to granting access to memory locations that store additional electronic authenticating material . In the illustrated embodiment the mobile communications device is a mobile telephone capable of establishing a communications session with external resources via a network as well as capable of directly connecting to an external resource via a communications link . Alternatively the mobile communications device is a portable computer such as a laptop or a personal digital assistant PDA having network communication interfaces for connecting to the network . Preferably the network is a wireless wide area network such as of the type employing a cellular based wireless standard. In embodiments the network relies on CDMA 2000 1X 1xEV DO 1xEV DV GSM GPRS EDGE HSPDA UMTS LTE 3GPP Long Term Evolution or UMB Ultra Mobile Broadband network access technology. In other embodiments the network is a LAN a WLAN e.g. Wi Fi or a WiMAX network.

To gain access to an external resource the mobile communications device preferably performs a two factor authentication procedure by initially authenticating a user via the external authenticating module and subsequently conveying another authenticating factor chosen among the locally stored electronic authenticating material . To this end the mobile communications device includes a contactless reader such as an RFID reader for wirelessly e.g. inductively coupling to an external authenticating module . The external authenticating module is capable of communicating a unique identifier associated with a user in order to validate the user s identity and provide one of the two authenticating factors without the need to manually enter a pass phrase or other user authentication information. Physical possession of the mobile communications device having locally stored electronic authenticating material serves as another authenticating factor. Preferably the local electronic authenticating material is stored in a secure memory location of the mobile communications device . Alternatively the local authenticating material resides in a secure memory location of a removable storage card associated with the mobile communications device such as a SIM card.

To decrease the possibility of loss the external authenticating module is associated with a user of the mobile communications device and preferably comprises an RFID tag embedded into a personal object of the user. In one embodiment the authenticating module is incorporated into the user s personal jewelry such as a wristwatch a keychain a bracelet or a pendant. In another embodiment the external authenticating module is implanted into a user s clothing. Alternatively the external authenticating module is incorporated into a plastic card of the size suitable to be stored in a user s wallet. In yet another embodiment the external authenticating module is permanently associated with the user s body such as via subcutaneous implantation.

When the external authenticating module includes an RFID tag the unique user identifier comprises a serial number portion of an Electronic Product Code EPC stored on the tag. EPC s are typically available in sixty four 64 and ninety six 96 bit formats. The format of an EPC code includes header manager number object class and serial number fields. The header field is governed by a standards body and is typically common to all identifiers. The manager number identifies an entity such as a company that administers a number space for the RFID tag including the object class and serial number bits. In an embodiment a mobile communications device manufacturer manages the number space for the RFID tag associated with the external authenticating module . In this case the mobile communications device recognizes only the RFID tags with a manager number field corresponding to the manufacturer and having particular object class and serial number values. Secure memory of the mobile communications device includes an EPC serial number field corresponding to the user. The EPC serial number stored in the mobile communications device is cross referenced with one or more RFID tags having identical predetermined EPC values. In another embodiment the manager number field belongs to an industry trade consortium and is shared among multiple manufacturers of the mobile communications device .

Upon detecting a request to access one or more of the external resources the mobile communications device initially searches for presence of the external authenticating module in its proximity in order to receive the unique identifier necessary for granting access to the electronic authenticating material . Once the mobile communications device validates the unique identifier received from the external authenticating module the mobile communications device accesses the locally stored electronic authenticating material and communicates the associated information to one or more external resources . The electronic authenticating material stored on the mobile communications device includes one or more of a username and password a pass phrase a personal identification number PIN a digital certificate and or an NFC identifier. When the requested resources includes a secure web server or a VPN server the mobile communications device communicates the information associated with the locally stored electronic authenticating material to the external resources by accessing the network and establishing a communications session via the Internet . The secure web server hosts a secure web application requiring authentication via at least one electronic authenticating factor chosen among electronic authenticating material stored on the mobile communications device . Exemplary embodiments of an application hosted by a secure web server include an online banking application an internet commerce application as well as a media streaming or media downloading service. Similarly the VPN server hosts one or more enterprise applications residing on a corporate network which also requires authentication via electronic authenticating material residing on the mobile communications device .

When the requested resources include a Near Field Communication NFC device the mobile communications device establishes a communications session directly with the NFC device via a wireless communications link in accordance with an NFC protocol. The NFC device includes an NFC protocol compatible device that requires authentication to communicate with the mobile communications device such as for purposes of providing mobile payment mobile ticketing user identification or access control functionality. In embodiments the NFC device comprises a point of sale device such as a check out register or an unattended payment machine such as a parking meter. The NFC device also includes electronically activated door lock devices for controlling physical access to buildings. In yet another embodiment the NFC device is a computer or a computer network access point that requires authentication via electronic authenticating material stored on the mobile communications device .

Turning to an embodiment of a mobile communications device is shown. The processor interfaces with the mobile device operating system to manage the operation of memory communications network interface RFID reader and NFC circuitry . The communications network interface is of the type compatible with the access network . When the mobile communications device launches an application which requires access to one of the external resources the RFID authenticator module detects the access request and checks whether the requested resource is on the list of resources that require additional user authentication prior to granting access to locally stored electronic authenticating material . The multifactor authentication list is compiled when mobile applications making use of one or more external resources are loaded onto the mobile communications device . If the external resource is on the multifactor authentication list the RFID authenticator module queries the RFID reader for the presence of the external authenticating module in the immediate proximity of the mobile device . The RFID reader in turn scans for the presence of the external authenticating module to report a unique identifier such as an RFID number i.e. an EPC value associated with an RFID tag of the external authenticating module to the RFID authenticator . The RFID authenticator grants access to the stored electronic authentication material once it validates the received RFID number by matching it with a corresponding number pre programmed in the mobile device s secure memory area .

Thus when a mobile web browser application for example requests access to a secure web service resource such as a web server hosting an online banking application the web browser application retrieves the user s username and password stored in the application database only after the RFID authenticator has validated the user via the RFID number received from the external authenticating module . In one embodiment the application database is a mobile password manager application such as eWallet available from Ilium Software Inc. for storing the mobile user s username password pass phrase and or PIN information required for authentication with an external resource . In another embodiment the application database is an Internet cookie database used by the mobile device s web browser to store username password pass phrase and or PIN information associated with previously visited web sites.

Upon initial user authentication via the RFID number the mobile communications device reads the username password pass phrase or PIN information from the application database and communicates this information to the secure web server via an HTTP Digest SSL or TLS security protocols. Similarly upon initial RFID authentication the mobile communications device reads the digital certificate information stored in the digital certificate store and communicates this information to the VPN server via a protocol such as TCP. Alternatively the mobile communications device accesses the application database to communicate the username password pass phrase or PIN information to the VPN server . To access the NFC device after completing the initial RFID authentication the mobile communications device reads the addressable memory locations of the NFC chipset or circuitry to communicate the NFC identifier stored therein to the NFC device via the NFC protocol. In another embodiment the NFC identifier is stored in the memory of the mobile communications device . In this case the communications device obtains the NFC identifier information by addressing the secure memory area . Alternatively the NFC identifier is stored on a removable storage card associated with the mobile communications device such as a SIM module.

In the illustrated embodiment the RFID authenticator module is a software component such as a BREW platform extension residing in memory . The RFID authenticator detects access requests to external resources by interfacing with the operating system and mobile applications via an application programming interface API . Other embodiments include a firmware implementation of the RFID authenticator .

Turning to an embodiment of a method for gaining access to an external resource from a mobile communications device via a plurality of authenticating factors is shown. Specifically in step if the RFID authenticator detects that a mobile application is requesting access to an external resource the RFID authenticator checks whether the external resource is on the list of resources for which multifactor authentication is required step . If the requested resource is not on the multifactor authentication list then in step the application requesting access to the external resource verifies whether one factor authentication is required. If so in step the requesting application provides the necessary authenticating factor to the requested resource such as by requesting user input or otherwise accessing the authenticating information. Subsequently in step the mobile communications device gains access to the requested resource. Additionally if the external resource does not require authentication the mobile communications device gains immediate access to the requested resource. If however the requested resource is on the multifactor authentication list then the RFID authenticator instructs the RFID reader to scan for the presence of an RFID tag incorporated into the external authenticating module step . In step access to the external resource is denied if the RFID authenticator fails to detect the presence of the external authenticating module or when the received RFID number does not match the unique identifier stored in the mobile communications device step . If however the RFID authenticator validates the received RFID number the requesting application is allowed to read the information associated with the locally stored electronic authenticating material step . Therefore the requesting application gains access to the desired external resource in step upon communicating the information associated with the corresponding electronic authenticating material in step .
