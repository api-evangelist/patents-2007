This invention was developed at least in part under DARPA Contract No. 4400121759. The Government may have certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to semiconductor devices and more particularly to Group III nitride based high electron mobility transistors HEMTs .

HEMTs are semiconductor devices that can be used for a variety of applications including microwave and millimeter wave communications radar radio astronomy cell phones direct broadcast satellite receivers and electronic warfare systems.

Traditional semiconductors usually require a conductive layer that is doped with n type impurities to generate free electrons however the electrons within the layer tend to collide with these impurities which slows them down. HEMTs are field effect transistors that utilize the heterojunction between two materials having different bandgaps to form a conductive channel rather than a doped region. HEMTs typically do not require impurities to form the conductive layer and therefore allow for higher electron mobility.

HEMTs are regularly fabricated from semiconductor materials such as silicon Si and gallium arsenide GaAs . Si has a low electron mobility which generates a high source resistance therefore Si semiconductor materials may not be well suited for high power high frequency and high temperature applications.

Signal amplification devices in radar cellular and satellite communications frequently use GaAs based HEMTs. GaAs semiconductor materials have higher electron mobility and a lower source resistance than Si which allows them to operate at higher frequencies. GaAs has however a relatively small bandgap preventing the use of GaAs HEMTs in high power at high frequency applications.

Improvements in the manufacturing of gallium nitride GaN semi conductor materials and semi conductor materials made from an alloy consisting of aluminum nitride and gallium nitride AlGaN have focused interest on the use of AlGaN GaN HEMTs for use in high frequency high power and high temperature applications. AlGaN and GaN have large bandgaps making them superior to Si and GaAs for these types of applications.

The use of AlGaN layered upon GaN and the mismatch of the crystal structures of the two materials and their different bandgap energies results in the creation of a two dimensional electron gas 2DEG under certain circumstances. The 2DEG layer accumulates in the smaller bandgap material and contains a very high electron concentration. Electrons originating in the wider bandgap material transfer to the 2DEG allowing for a higher electron mobility.

The combination of high electron concentration and high electron mobility gives AlGaN GaN HEMTs greater performance than metal semiconductor field effect transistors MESFETs for high frequency applications.

One method of fabricating an AlGaN GaN HEMT includes forming a layer of GaN on a substrate typically silicon carbide SiC forming a thin layer of AlGaN on the GaN layer and providing ohmic contacts and a gate contact on the AlGaN layer.

Traditionally an alloy of titanium Ti aluminum Al nickel Ni and gold Au forms the ohmic contacts. In order to function as an electronic contact the alloy must be ohmic towards the 2DEG layer rather than the AlGaN layer on which it is placed. The addition of Au to this alloy enables the contacts to be ohmic towards the 2DEG however the Au also gives the alloy bad morphology.

Another method of forming low resistive ohmic contacts on AlGaN GaN HEMTs generally well understood within the art employs ion implantation at the ohmic contact region. Implantation in this manner allows the use of a Ti Ni Al contact thus eliminating the poor morphology created by the use of Au.

Nevertheless this implantation process creates another problem because of the high doses of implantation ions that must be used in order to get sufficient activation rates within the implanted regions. The high doses of implantation ions create large amounts of crystal destruction. This destruction can be corrected by annealing the device however SiC and AlGaN are difficult to recrystallize by annealing. In order to recrystallize SiC and AlGaN properly longer annealing times can be used. Longer anneal times however damage other features of the device.

Therefore there is a need for an implantation process that uses high doses of ions and creates less damage to the implanted crystal thus requiring less annealing.

In one aspect the invention is a method of forming a high electron mobility transistor. The method includes implanting a Group III nitride layer at a defined position with ions that when implanted produce an improved ohmic contact between the layer and contact metals.

Implantation is carried out at a temperature higher than room temperature and hot enough to reduce the amount of damage done to the Group III nitride layer but below a temperature at which surface problems causing leakage at the gate or epitaxial layer dissociation would occur. An ohmic contact is added to the implanted defined position on the Group III nitride layer.

In another aspect the method includes carrying out the implantation with an ion beam current high enough to successfully implant ions within the Group III nitride layer but below a current that would melt or destroy the Group III nitride layer and at a temperature higher than room temperature and hot enough to reduce the amount of damage done to the Group III nitride layer but below a temperature at which surface problems causing leakage at the gate or epitaxial layer dissociation would occur.

In yet another aspect the invention is a transistor precursor that includes a growth substrate selected from the group consisting of silicon carbide and sapphire a layer of gallium nitride on the growth substrate a layer of aluminum gallium nitride on the gallium nitride layer for generating a two dimensional electron gas at the interface between the layers when a current is applied in a HEMT orientation and defined implanted regions in the aluminum gallium nitride and gallium nitride layers for improving the ohmic characteristics of the layers when an ohmic metal is added to the defined implanted regions with the defined implanted regions of the transistor precursor having a temperature of between about 250 and 900 C.

The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the invention and the manner in which the same are accomplished will become clearer based on the followed detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Preferably SiC forms the substrate . The crystal lattice structure of SiC matches more closely to the Group III nitrides than sapphire resulting in higher quality Group III nitride films. Furthermore SiC has a very high thermal conductivity which allows for higher total output power of the device.

The AlGaN layer has a wider bandgap than the GaN layer which results in a free charge transfer from the AlGaN layer to the GaN layer . Charge accumulates at the interface of the AlGaN layer and the GaN layer forming a two dimensional electron gas 2DEG not shown . The 2DEG has very high electron mobility resulting in a HEMT with very high transconductance at high frequencies. The voltage applied to the gate controls the electron flow in the 2DEG under the gate allowing for control over the total electron flow. Preferably the gate is a Schottky gate.

The source contact and drain contact provided on the AlGaN layer are preferably formed of alloys of titanium Ti aluminum Al and nickel Ni . Traditional alloys used for ohmic contacts and are formed of Ti Al Ni as well as gold Au . The addition of Au gives the alloy poor morphology so the contacts and of the present invention preferably do not include Au. Other candidate compositions for the ohmic contact include titanium tungsten nitride Ti W N titanium nitride Ti N molybdenum Mo and molybdenum silicides.

High temperature ion implantation using a high ion beam current of an n type dopant creates the implanted regions and . Preferably the dopant ions are Si. These implanted regions and allow the contacts and to be ohmic towards the 2DEG.

High temperature as used herein should be understood to include temperatures that are below a temperature at which surface problems causing leakage at the gate or epitaxial layer dissociation would occur but higher than room temperature. Preferably the temperature at which implantation occurs is between about 250 C. and 900 C.

High ion beam current as used herein should be understood to include a beam current below that which would melt or destroy the crystal but high enough to successfully implant ions within the AlGaN and GaN layers and . Preferably the beam current is between 30 A and 130 A.

In one embodiment the present invention is an AlGaN GaN HEMT wherein implanted regions and have been implanted at a temperature of 650 C. using an ion beam current of 40 A.

In another embodiment the present invention is an AlGaN GaN HEMT wherein implanted regions and have been implanted at a temperature of 650 C. using an ion beam current of 120 A.

In a third embodiment the present invention is an AlGaN GaN HEMT wherein implanted regions and have been implanted at a temperature of 350 C. using an ion beam current of 40 A.

In a fourth embodiment the present invention is an AlGaN GaN HEMT wherein implanted regions and have been implanted at a temperature of 350 C. using an ion beam current of 120 A.

The present invention also includes methods for fabricating HEMTs using high temperature ion implantation. U.S. Pat. No. 7 230 284 discloses a method for forming the GaN layer on the substrate and forming the AlGaN layer on the GaN layer as illustrated in .

As illustrated in a mask layer protects only the portion of the AlGaN layer that will not be implanted leaving the crystal exposed in the regions to be implanted. The mask layer is a material capable of withstanding the conditions of the high temperature high ion beam current implantation without otherwise adversely affecting either the implantation step or the device. For example the mask layer may be formed of an oxide.

The device is then maintained at a high temperature and a high current beam implants n type dopant ions e.g. Si ions through the AlGaN layer into the GaN layer to form implanted regions and . The ions are implanted to a depth that allows the ohmic contacts and to act ohmic towards the 2DEG.

As illustrated in in a particular embodiment of this method a protective layer may be placed over the regions to be implanted. In a more particular embodiment silicon nitride SiN is the protective layer . The protective layer reduces the amount of damage to the AlGaN layer created by the ion beam. The use of a protective layer is preferred because AlGaN can be particularly difficult to recrystallize using annealing methods.

After implantation an annealing process improves the damaged implanted regions and . Shorter anneal times are desired because the anneal has the potential to damage other parts of the device. Implantation at high temperature results in less damage to the implanted regions and therefore allows shorter anneal times which reduces the possibility for anneal based secondary damage.

As illustrated in ohmic contacts and are then formed on the AlGaN layer over the implanted regions and . The ohmic contacts and connect with the 2DEG electronically through the implanted regions and . Preferably an alloy of Ti Ni and Al forms the ohmic contacts and .

A gate can be formed on the AlGaN layer over the 2DEG. The voltage applied to the gate controls the electron flow in the 2DEG allowing for control over the total electron flow. Preferably the gate is a Schottky gate.

Each wafer in is GaN that has been implanted with Si ions. illustrate that conducting the implantation step of this method at high temperature avoids damaging the implanted crystals as much as implantation at room temperature. In the lighter shades indicate more light passage based upon less crystal damage while darker shades indicate less light passage resulting from more crystal damage.

In the top left quarter of the wafer has been implanted using an ion beam current of 120 A at a temperature of 350 C. The bottom right quarter of the wafer has been implanted using an ion beam current of 120 A at room temperature. The top left quarter is significantly lighter than the bottom right quarter indicating significantly less damage because of the higher temperature during implantation.

Similarly in the top left quarter of the wafer has been implanted using an ion beam current of 120 A at a temperature of 650 C. The bottom right quarter of the wafer has been implanted using an ion beam current of 120 A at room temperature. The top left quarter is significantly lighter than the bottom right quarter indicating significantly less damage because of the higher temperature during implantation.

A comparison of the top left quarter of the wafer in and the top left quarter of the wafer in also indicates that implantation at higher temperatures decreases the amount of crystal damage created by the implantation process.

The use of a high current ion beam provides two distinct advantages over a lower current ion beam. Using a high current ion beam reduces the time it takes to implant a given dose of dopant ions therefore reducing costs. Additionally the use of a high current ion beam further increases the temperature of the wafer during implantation resulting in less damage to the implanted crystal.

The wafer in illustrates the second advantage of using a higher current ion beam. In the top left quarter of the wafer has been implanted using an ion beam current of 120 A at a temperature of 350 C. The bottom right quarter of the wafer has been implanted using an ion beam current of 40 A at a temperature of 350 C. The top left quarter is significantly lighter than the bottom right quarter indicating significantly less damage because of the higher ion beam current during implantation. Some of the reduced damage in the top left quarter may be attributable to the fact that it was effectively annealed at 350 C. while the bottom right quarter of the wafer was being implanted. The difference in clarity created by the anneal is believed to be less significant than the difference in clarity created by the higher ion beam current.

The two highest plots one formed of squares and the other of diamonds indicate the transmission percentages of two GaN wafers that have not been implanted. As shown in these unimplanted wafers transmit the highest percentage of visible light.

The lowest plot formed of downward pointing triangles indicates the transmission percentage of a GaN wafer implanted with Si at room temperature with an ion beam current of 120 A over the visible range. As shown in this wafer transmits the lowest percentage of visible light.

The mid level plot formed of circles indicates the transmission percentage of a GaN wafer implanted with Si at a temperature of 650 C. with an ion beam current of 120 A over the visible range. The mid level plot formed of diamonds indicates the transmission percentage of a GaN wafer implanted with Si at a temperature of 350 C. with an ion beam current of 120 A over the visible range. The mid level plot formed of downward pointing triangles indicates the transmission percentage of a GaN wafer implanted with Si at a temperature of 350 C. with an ion beam current of 40 A over the visible range. These three mid level plots indicate the transmission spectrums of three different wafers that are embodiments of the present invention. As shown in these three wafers transmit more light over the visible range than the wafer implanted at room temperature. also indicates that these three wafers transmit less light over the visible range than the unimplanted wafers.

It should also be noted that the mid level plot formed of diamonds i.e. the wafer implanted at 350 C. with a current of 120 A has higher values over the visible range than the mid level plot formed of downward pointing triangles i.e the wafer implanted at 350 C. with a current of 40 A . This comparison indicates that wafers implanted at higher beam currents typically transmit a greater percentage of light than wafers implanted at lower beam currents.

The plots show that implantation at high temperatures e.g. the three mid level plots produces a wafer that transmits a much higher percentage of visible light than implantation at room temperature e.g. the lowest plot . The transmission percentage correlates with less damage to the crystal structure of the wafer. Therefore implantation at high temperatures creates less damage to the crystal structure of the wafer than implantation at room temperature.

The plot also shows that a wafer implanted using a higher ion beam current e.g. the mid level plot formed of diamonds transmits a higher percentage of visible light than a wafer implanted using a lower ion beam current e.g. the mid level plot formed of downward pointing triangles . Once again the transmission percentage correlates with less damage to the crystal structure of the wafer. Therefore implantation using higher ion beam currents creates less damage to the crystal structure of the wafer than implantation at lower ion beam currents.

The method of the present invention produces HEMTs with significantly less damage to the crystal than previously disclosed methods. As a result HEMTs produced using the method of the present invention perform superiorly to prior HEMTs.

The following table contains data on the performance of a HEMT device implanted at room temperature and a HEMT device implanted at high temperature in accordance with the present invention 

The wafers of the table received the same implant dose of 1.00 10atoms cmof Si and the same temperature anneal 1080 C. . The data shows that both wafers were supplied with the same RF power gate source voltage drain source voltage and current. The high temperature implanted HEMT had a higher gain output power power added efficiency and drain source current as well as a lower average on resistance. This data indicates that devices formed according to the present invention have better device performance than devices formed using ion implantation at room temperature.

In the drawings and specification there has been set forth a preferred embodiment of the invention and although specific terms have been employed they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation the scope of the invention being defined in the claims.
