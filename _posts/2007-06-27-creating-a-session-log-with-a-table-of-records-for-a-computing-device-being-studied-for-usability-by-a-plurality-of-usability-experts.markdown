The field of the invention is data processing or more specifically methods systems and products for creating a session log for a computing device being studied for usability by a plurality of usability experts.

When computer architects design a computing device and its software these architects often make a great effort to ensure that the device is convenient and easy to use from the perspective of a user. For example the buttons on the device should be easily accessible when needed for device interaction while not hindering the user s interaction with the device when the buttons are not in use. As a further example the graphical user interface of a device should be logically arranged and configured from the user s perspective such that the user s interaction with the device is intuitive for the user.

To ensure that a computing device is convenient and easy to use from a user s perspective computer architects typically perform usability studies on the interaction of a user with the computing device. Usability refers to a full range of aspects that impact a user s success and satisfaction when interacting with the device. Usability encompass issues such as for example a user s understanding of how to operate the device s interface the ease with which a user is able to physically manipulate the device and its controls a user s emotions while interacting with the device the correspondence between the user s desired output from the device and the output actually produced by the device and so on. In studying a device s usability high usability is generally regarded as a desirable feature of the device.

Usability studies have traditionally been conducted by having a usability expert observe a user interacting with a computing device and record the expert s observations in a log. The drawback to this traditional approach to studying usability is that the information recorded in the log is limited to the observations capable of being observed by a usability expert. As devices have become smaller and more complex the ability of a usability expert to observe importance aspects affecting the user s interaction with a computing device is greatly diminished. In particular some aspects of the user s interaction may not be observable at all. As such readers will appreciate that room for improvement exists in the area of studying the usability of a computing device.

Methods systems and products are disclosed for creating a session log for a computing device being studied for usability by a plurality of usability experts that include displaying by a usability engine to a plurality of usability experts a usability observation video of a user interacting with a computing device during a usability session for studying the usability of the device detecting by an event listener on the computing device an event generated as a result of user interaction with the device notifying by the event listener the usability engine of the event recording by the usability engine a description of the event in a session log receiving by the usability engine from at least one of the usability experts usability observations regarding the usability of the device and recording by the usability engine the usability observations in the session log.

In the example of the observation recorder may provide the observation data to a usability engine using data communications architectures such as for example web services CORBA Java Remote Method Invocation API and so on. CORBA refers to the Common Object Request Broker Architecture a computer industry specifications for interoperable enterprise applications produced by the Object Management Group OMG . CORBA is a standard for remote procedure invocation first published by the OMG in 1991. CORBA can be considered a kind of object oriented way of making remote procedure calls although CORBA supports features that do not exist in conventional RPC. CORBA uses a declarative language the Interface Definition Language IDL to describe an object s interface. Interface descriptions in IDL are compiled to generate stubs for the client side and skeletons on the server side. Using this generated code remote method invocations effected in object oriented programming languages such as C or Java look like invocations of local member methods in local objects.

The Java Remote Method Invocation API is a Java application programming interface for performing remote procedural calls published by Sun Microsystems . The Java RMI API is an object oriented way of making remote procedure calls between Java objects existing in separate Java Virtual Machines that typically run on separate computers. The Java RMI API uses a remote procedure object interface to describe remote objects that reside on the server. Remote procedure object interfaces are published in an RMI registry where Java clients can obtain a reference to the remote interface of a remote Java object. Using compiled stubs for the client side and skeletons on the server side to provide the network connection operations the Java RMI allows a Java client to access a remote Java object just like any other local Java object.

An event listener may be implemented as interrupt handler instrumentation code having instrumentation hooks embedded in other software components a subroutine called by another software module or any other implementation as will occur to those of skill in the art.

Because some event listeners may only be concerned with a single event and are only executed when the event occurs such an event listener may detect an event according to the method of by receiving processing control of the computing device s processor upon the occurrence of the event. Processing control may be transferred to an event listener using an interrupt or through a function call directed by another software module. In other embodiments an event listener may detect an event according to the method of by polling hardware registers or software variables to identify whether a particular event has occurred.

The method of also includes notifying by the event listener the usability engine of the event . A usability engine is a software component that receives event notifications from one or more event listeners and that administers the session log and the usability observation video . The event listener may notify a usability engine of the event according to the method of by encapsulating a description of the event in an event notification message and transmitting the event notification message to the usability engine. The event listener may transmit the event notification message to the usability engine using any message passing mechanism as will occur to those of skill in the art including web services a CORBA framework and Java RMI. The event notification message of represents a data structure for providing a usability engine with information regarding an event that occurred on the computing device in response to a user s interaction with the device . The description of the event in an event notification message may include the following exemplary information 

The method of includes recording by the usability engine a description of the event in the session log . The session log of represents a data structure that stores information provided by a usability expert that describes an interaction of a user with a computing device during a usability session and information provided by one or more event listeners that is generate as a result of the user interaction with the device. A session log may be implemented as a table of a database text file or any other implementation as will occur to those of skill in the art. The usability engine may record a description of the event in the session log according to the method of by receiving the event notification message provided by the event listener extracting the description of the event from the event notification message and storing the event description in the session log .

The method of also includes receiving by the usability engine from at least one of the usability experts usability observations regarding the usability of the device . A usability observation is a description of any aspect of the user s interaction with the device that the usability expert deems relevant to the usability study. For example usability observations may describe the user s emotional state as the user operates the device the speech spoken by the user to the device the synthesized speech provided by the device to the user a description of how well the user appears to be operating the device and any other aspect of the user s interaction that the usability expert deems relevant to the usability study. The usability engine may receive usability observations from at least one of the usability experts according to the method of by receiving a observation notification message from observation recorder software installed on the usability expert s computer. The usability expert providing the usability observations may enter the observations into observation recorder software installed on the usability expert s computer as the usability expert views the usability observation video . As the observation recorder software receives usability observations from a usability expert the observation recorder software may timestamp the usability observations encapsulate the usability observations in the observation notification message and transmit the observation notification message to the usability engine through a data communications connection. The data communications connection may be implemented using web service a CORBA framework Java RMI or any other implementation as will occur to those of skill in the art.

The method of includes recording by the usability engine the usability observations in the session log . The usability engine may record the usability observations in the session log according to the method of by unencapsulating the usability observations from the observation notification message and storing the usability observations in the session log . The usability engine may store the usability observations in the session log as the usability observations are received from the observation recorder software used by the usability experts to enter the observation .

As mentioned above usability experts may view the usability observation video in real time during the usability session or they may view the usability observation video after the usability session is concluded. When the usability experts view the usability observation video after the usability session is concluded the usability observations provided by the usability experts will not typically bear timestamps that permit the usability engine to insert the observations in the session log in the proper time sequence with respect to the event description data in the session log which is typically recorded in near real time as the events are detected by the event listeners. Upon receiving the usability observations from a usability expert when the expert views the usability observation video after the usability session is concluded the usability engine may have to identify the portion of the session log that corresponds to the time in the usability video at which the usability expert entered the usability observation in order that the usability engine may insert the observation into the session log in the proper time sequence with respect to the event description data already stored in the session log. For further explanation therefore consider that sets forth a flow chart illustrating a further exemplary method of creating a session log for a computing device being studied for usability by a plurality of usability experts according to embodiments of the present invention.

The method of is similar to the method of .

The method of also includes identifying the portion of the usability observation video displayed to the usability expert when the usability expert observed the usability observations using timecodes embedded in the usability observation video . The timecodes embedded in the usability observation video are signals typically encoded in each frame of the usability observation video to identify each frame and to provide the frame s relative location in the video timeline. The timecodes embedded in the usability observation video may be implemented as Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers SMPTE timecodes MIDI timecodes Rewriteable Consumer timecodes and any other timecodes as will occur to those of skill in the art.

As mentioned above the usability observations are typically timestamped as the observations are entered by the usability expert . The usability engine may therefore identify the portion of the usability observation video displayed to the usability expert when the usability expert observed the usability observations according to the method of by tracking the times at which the frames of the usability observation video are displayed to the usability expert and identifying the frames of the usability observation video displayed at a time that matches the timestamp of the usability observations . In the example of the frames of the usability observation video displayed at a time that matches the timestamp of the usability observations represent the portion of the usability observation video displayed to the usability expert when the usability expert observed the usability observations . When matching the time at which the frames of the video are displayed to the timestamp of the usability observations the usability engine may take into account any timing skews that result when two different clocks are used. For example one clock may be used to track the times at which the frames are displayed by the usability engine while another clock may be used to embed the time in the usability observations . To correct any such timing skews the usability engine may calculate the skew between the two clocks and factor in the calculated timing skew when matching the time at which the frames of the video are displayed to the timestamp of the usability observations . Readers will note however that timing skews can be avoided if the same clock is used to match the time at which the frames of the video are displayed to the timestamp of the usability observations . Such a clock will typically be implemented in the computer used by the usability expert to view the usability observation video. In such an embodiment the computer used by the usability expert may embed the identified frames of the video in the observation notification message sent to the usability engine so that the usability engine is able to identify the portion of the video displayed to the expert when the observation was entered.

The method of also includes identifying by the usability engine the portion of the session log that corresponds to the identified portion of the usability observation video . The usability engine may identify the portion of the session log that corresponds to the identified portion of the usability observation video according to the method of by retrieving timecodes from the frames that make up the identified portion of the video and selecting a location in the session log having event descriptions with timestamps that match the timecodes of the frames that make up the identified portion of the video . In the example of the selected location in the session log represents the identified portion of the session log that corresponds to the identified portion of the usability observation video .

As mentioned above the method of includes recording by the usability engine the usability observations in the session log . Recording by the usability engine the usability observations in the session log according to the method of includes inserting the usability observations in the identified portion of the session log .

Usability experts may specialize in certain aspects of usability. For example one usability expert may specialize as a cognitive psychologist another as a user interface specialist another as an application expert still another as a language specialist and so on. Based on their specialties each usability expert may have a particular role in studying the usability of a particular computing device. When each usability expert has a particular role in studying the usability of a device the usability engine may only record usability observation from a particular expert when the type of observation matches the role of the particular expert. For further explanation therefore sets forth a flow chart illustrating a further exemplary method of creating a session log for a computing device being studied for usability by a plurality of usability experts according to embodiments of the present invention in which each usability expert has a particular role in studying the usability of the device .

The method of is similar to the method of .
