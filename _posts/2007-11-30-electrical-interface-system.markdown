This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 007 912 filed Dec. 18 2006.

The United States Government has certain rights in the present application and any patent that may issue thereon under DOE Contract No. DE FC26 04NT42258.

Electrical buses are used in a variety of applications including electric vehicles and computers. An electrical bus is a parallel circuit that is used to connect a plurality of electrical devices together with power sources such as generators solar cells and batteries. Electrical buses may be used in high power applications to deliver power from a power source to the electrical devices. Typically electrical buses may be used in direct current applications and may have a positive line and a negative line or ground line .

A problem that may arise in direct current applications is that electrical devices may store electrical power. Consequently when the electrical bus is disconnected from a power source the electrical devices continue to energize the electrical bus with the stored electrical power. Thus a relatively long period of time may be required for the electrical bus to return to a low energy state where the electrical potential between the positive line and the negative line is minimal. Because of this long period of time repair and maintenance times and costs may be increased dramatically as technicians are forced to wait for the electrical bus to return to a low energy state before beginning repairs.

The interface system may include a first end and a second end in electrical communication with the first end. The interface system may also include a reverse current blocking circuit configured to block current from flowing from the second end to the first end. Additionally the interface system may include a discharge circuit electrically connected between the first end and the second end for discharging the blocked current.

The interface system may be used to connect in an electrical system such that the first end may be connected to an electrical bus and the second end may be connected to an electrical device. Of course the interface system may be used in other applications including directly connecting an electrical device to a power source.

The electrical bus may be connected to a power source providing current to the electrical bus. Additionally the electrical system may include a plurality of electrical devices in electrical communication with the electrical bus. In these configurations of the electrical system one or more of the plurality of electrical devices may be connected to the electrical bus via the interface system. Of course all of the electrical devices may be connected to the electrical bus through an interface system.

When the interface system is connected in an electrical system to an electrical bus and an electrical device the reverse current blocking circuit prevents current from flowing from the at least one electrical device to the electrical bus when the power source is disconnected from the electrical bus. Additionally the discharge circuit discharges electrical power stored within the electrical device when the power source is disconnected from the electrical bus.

Referring to a schematic view illustrates an electrical system that may include a power source an electrical bus and a switch connecting the power source with the electrical bus . The power source provides current to and energizes the electrical bus . The power source may include a generator a battery a fuel cell a solar cell or any other power source known in the art.

The electrical bus may have a positive line and a negative line that may be connected to the power source through the switch . The switch has a first mode in which the switch places the electrical bus in electrical communication with the power source . The switch also has a second mode in which the switch electrically connects the positive line with the negative line .

The switch may be a mechanical switch such as a bi stable mechanism. Of course the switch may be any other type of switch known in the art including electrical switches such as power transistors and electromechanical switches such as solenoid and relay operated switches.

In configurations of the electrical system that include a switch the electrical system may also include a bus discharge circuit . The bus discharge circuit is disposed between the switch and the negative line so that when the switch is in the second mode current is permitted to pass over the bus discharge circuit between the positive line and the negative line . The bus discharge circuit may include a power resistor not shown disposed between the positive line and the negative line .

The electrical system may also include a plurality of electrical devices and an interface system that may connect each electrical device to the electrical bus . Of course some of the electrical devices may be connected directly to the electrical bus . The electrical devices may be electrical control modules sensor modules motors HVAC systems pumps and personal entertainment equipment such as view screens video game and media players GPS devices computers and other devices known in the art. Electrical devices may also include other electrical devices known in the art and devices that store power through capacitance.

The interface system operates to prevent the connected electrical device from providing electrical power to the electrical bus once the power source has been disconnected from the electrical bus by either placing the switch in the second mode or through damage to the electrical bus . Consequently a repair person can perform maintenance or repair to the electrical bus soon after the disconnection of the power source takes place. Additionally the interface system permits the repair person to quickly remove electrical devices from the electrical bus should the need arise.

Referring to a configuration of the interface system is shown connected to one of the electrical devices . More specifically the interface system may be part of the electrical device . In other words the interface system may include a first end and a second end in electrical communication with the first end and electrically connected to the electrical device .

Between the first and second ends the interface system may include a reverse current blocking circuit configured to block current from flowing from the second end to the first end . More specifically in this configuration the reverse current blocking circuit may be configured to prevent current from flowing from the electrical device to the first end . In the configuration of the reverse current blocking circuit may be configured to block current from flowing from the electrical device to electrical bus when the power source is disconnected from the electrical bus .

The interface system may also include a discharge circuit electrically connected between the first and second ends . The discharge circuit may be used to discharge the current blocked by the reverse current blocking circuit . In the configuration of the discharge circuit may be used to discharge electrical power stored within the electrical device when the power source is disconnected from the electrical bus .

The first end of the interface system may include an electrical connector that facilitates connecting the electrical device to the electrical bus of . As shown the electrical connector may include a first contact and a second contact . In this configuration of the interface system the reverse current blocking circuit may prevent current from flowing from the second end to the first contact .

The electrical connector may include a shorting system having an open condition that disconnects the first contact from the second contact and a closed condition in which current is allowed to flow from the first contact to the second contact through the shorting system . In illustrated configuration of the shorting system the shorting system may include a shorting arm that moves between the open condition and the closed condition within a housing of the electrical connector to abut the first and second contacts . In the open condition the shorting arm is positioned remotely from the first and second contacts which disconnects the first contact from the second contact . In the closed condition the shorting arm abuts the first and second contacts to electrically connect the first contact with the second contact so that current is allowed to flow from the first contact to the second contact through the shorting system .

To help ensure that the shorting system is in the open condition when the electrical connector is connected to the electrical bus of an end of the shorting arm may be disposed to contact the electrical bus before a respective end of the first and second contacts . For example the end of the shorting arm may be extend further from the housing than the ends of the first and second contacts . In other words when the electrical connector is in electrical communication with the power source of the shorting system is in the open condition . When the electrical connector is disconnected from the electrical bus the shorting system is in the closed condition .

The electrical connector may also include a shroud to prevent accidental contact upon disconnection with the first and second contacts and the shorting arm .

Referring to a configuration of an interface system is illustrated. As shown the interface system includes a first end and a second end . The first end may include a first electrical connector configured for connecting to a power source electrical bus or electrical device not shown . Similarly the second end may include a second electrical connector configured for connection to an electrical device not shown . As shown the first and second electrical connectors each include a first contact and a second contact .

The interface system also includes a reverse current blocking circuit . The reverse current blocking circuit may include a one way diode disposed between the first end and the second end . More specifically the one way diode may be disposed between the first contacts of the first and second electrical connectors . The one way diode blocks current from flowing from the second end to the first end while permitting current to flow from the first end to the second end . In some configurations the one way diode may be a power diode.

A discharge circuit may be used to discharge current flow blocked by the reverse current blocking circuit . Consequently the discharge circuit may include a resistor and may be disposed to electrically connect the first contact of the second connector with the second contact of the second connector . In some configurations the resistor is a power resistor.

The discharge circuit may also include an electrical switch that may be placed in an open or closed state. When the electrical switch is in the open state current is prevented from flowing across the resistor . Conversely when the electrical switch is in the closed state current flowing from the second end is permitted to pass across the resistor . Additionally when current is flowing across the reverse current blocking circuit from the first end to the second end the electrical switch may be in the closed state.

As shown the electrical switch may be a transistor and more specifically the electrical switch may be an N channel metal oxide field effect transistor. In some configurations the transistor may also be a power transistor.

The transistor may have a drain source and a gate . The drain may be in electrical communication with the first contact of the second electrical connector of the second end . The source may be in electrical communication with the second contacts of the first and second electrical connectors of the first and second ends . The gate may be in electrical communication with the first contact of the first electrical connector of the first end and may be protected by a zener diode .

Referring to another interface system is shown having a first end and a second end . In this configuration the interface system may include a reverse current blocking circuit that includes an electrical switch such as a transistor and more specifically an NPN transistor disposed between the first and second ends . The electrical switch is disposed such that when the interface system is connected to a power source and an electrical device not shown the electrical switch is in a closed state that permits current to flow across the electrical switch between the first and second ends and . Conversely when the power source is disconnected from the interface system the electrical switch is in an open state that blocks current flowing across the electrical switch between the first and second ends and .

The interface system may also include a discharge circuit having an electrical switch and a resistor for discharging current blocked by the reverse current blocking circuit . The resistor may be a power resistor or any other resistor known in the art.

The electrical switch may be a PNP transistor . A second resistor provides a path from a positive side to a negative side of the interface system in order to turn the electrical switch on when power is removed from the interface system .

More specifically the PNP transistor may include an emitter electrically connected to the positive side and a base electrically connected to positive side on an opposite of the reverse current blocking circuit from the emitter . Consequently when power is removed from the interface system the base of the PNP transistor is allowed to obtain a potential close to the negative side by allowing current to flow from the base to the negative side across the second resistor . Thus the PNP transistor is turned on when power is removed from the interface system . The PNP transistor also includes a collector electrically connected to the negative side .

In other words when a power source not shown is disconnected from the first end of the interface system the second resistor permits electrical energy on the first end of the positive side and thus the base to be discharged. The discharge of electrical energy permits the PNP transistor and hence the electrical switch to be placed in a closed state allowing current to flow over the resistor and the electrical switch to the negative side .

The interface system may also include an indicator for indicating that the discharge circuit is discharging electrical power. In other words the indicator may indicate when current is flowing over the resistor and the electrical switch . As shown the indicator may be a light emitting diode in parallel with a resistor . The resistor may cause a voltage drop across the light emitting diode causing the light emitting diode to emit light. The resistor may also reduce the current flowing across the light emitting diode . Of course the indicator may be any type of indicator known in the art including a speaker for producing an audible signal or a sensor that detects the flow of current and indicates this on a view screen not shown .

Referring to an interface system may include a heat sink that is in thermal communication with a power resistor and a power transistor of a discharge circuit . A thermal gel or adhesive may facilitate thermal transfer from the power resistor and the power transistor .

The discharge circuit may be formed on a printed circuit board that is spaced from the heat sink by a spacer . A resulting air gap helps prevent the heat generated by passing current over the power resistor and the power transistor from damaging other components not shown of the discharge circuit and the interface system .

The interface system described above facilitates the maintenance and repair of electrical buses by preventing electrical power stored within coupled electrical devices from energizing the electrical bus and by discharging the stored energy within the interface system. Consequently the electrical bus can be quickly de energized and then worked on by technicians while the electrical devices themselves may continue to store significant electrical energy. This may be especially useful in high power applications.

An electrical bus may be even more quickly discharged in electrical systems that also include a bus discharge circuit and an associated switch. The bus discharge circuit permits the power source to be disconnected while permitting current to pass over the bus discharge circuit.

Additionally where the interface system includes an electrical connector configured for connection to an electrical bus electrical devices can be disconnected from the electrical bus and or power source while maintaining electrical isolation from a technician. Specifically the interface system decreases the electrical potential between the contacts of the electrical connector once the interface system is disconnected from a power source.
