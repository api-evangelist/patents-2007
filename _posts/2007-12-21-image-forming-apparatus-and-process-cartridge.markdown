The present invention generally relates to an image forming apparatus such as a copier a printer or a facsimile machine using an electrophotographic process and a process cartridge used in the image forming apparatus.

In these days miniaturization high image quality and ecology are key factors in developing image forming apparatuses. A cleaner less image forming apparatus is one solution for reducing the size of an image forming apparatus. In a cleaner less image forming apparatus a developing unit functions also as a cleaning unit for removing toner remaining on a photoconductor after transferring a toner image and thus a dedicated cleaning device is omitted.

For example patent document 1 discloses a cleaner less image forming apparatus including a developing unit that forms a toner image by developing a latent image formed on a uniformly charged image carrier with a developer including spherical toner particles and carrier particles and held on a developer carrier. The developing unit contains yellow toner cyan toner magenta toner or black toner and also functions as a cleaning unit that reclaims toner remaining on the image carrier after transferring a toner image onto a recording medium hereafter such remaining toner may be called post transfer residual toner and while developing another toner image. The developing cleaning unit constitutes an image forming unit and multiple image forming units are disposed along a conveyor belt in the disclosed cleaner less image forming apparatus. A recording medium is conveyed by the conveyor belt through the image forming units to form a color image. In the disclosed cleaner less image forming apparatus an area of a spherical toner particle covered by a sizing agent is limited to 15 to 50 of the entire surface area the shape factor SF 1 of the spherical toner particles is between 100 and 140 and the shape factor SF 2 is between 100 and 120.

In a color image forming apparatus including multiple image forming units as described above toner images of different colors are formed by the image forming units transferred to and superposed on an intermediate transfer body in sequence by a primary transfer member and then transferred together onto a recording medium by a secondary transfer member. One problem in employing a cleaner less configuration in such a color image forming apparatus is that if toner on the intermediate transfer body or an image receiving body is transferred back onto a photoconductive drum hereafter such toner may be called reverse transferred toner and enters a developing unit toners of different colors are mixed in the developing unit and cause a color shift.

Patent document 2 discloses an image forming apparatus that tries to solve this problem. The disclosed image forming apparatus includes a photoconductor on which a toner image is formed and an intermediate transfer body onto which the toner image is transferred from the photoconductor. The toner image on the intermediate transfer body is transferred and fused to a recording medium to form an image on the recording medium. The disclosed image forming apparatus also includes a cleaning device comprising a scraper for scraping post transfer residual toner on the photoconductor and a housing containing the scraper and having an opening toward the surface of the intermediate transfer body.

In the image forming apparatus disclosed in patent document 2 the cleaning device prevents mixing of toners of different colors and prevents a charging unit from being tainted. However providing a cleaning device with such a housing increases the size and costs of an image forming apparatus.

Patent document 3 discloses a contact charging method used in an electrophotographic device. In the disclosed method a bias with a polarity opposite to the charge polarity of a photoconductor is applied to at least one of multiple charging units a bias of the same polarity as the charge polarity of the photoconductor is applied to at least one of the remaining charging units and the photoconductor is charged to a predetermined potential by the charging units. With this method however since a photoconductor is charged by multiple charging units the photoconductor is exposed to electrostatic hazards at two or more positions. As a result the influence of corona products on the photoconductor increases and the electrostatic characteristics of the photoconductor are gradually degraded as it is charged and discharged repeatedly. With the disclosed contact charging method this problem becomes especially prominent because a photoconductor is first charged to a polarity opposite to a desired charge polarity and then charged to the desired charge polarity.

Meanwhile in a color laser printer toner images of different colors are formed on a photoconductive drum or an image carrier using toners or developers of corresponding colors and the toner images are electrically transferred to and superposed on an image receiving body such as a recording medium or an intermediate transfer belt to form a multi color toner image.

Also in some color laser printers a photoconductive drum is provided for each of multiple colors. Such color laser printers are called tandem color laser printers.

In a color image forming process when a toner image of one color is transferred onto an image receiving body on which a toner image of another color is already present the charge amount of the already present toner image increases. Increase in the charge amount increases the chance of the toner of the already present toner image to be reverse transferred onto the photoconductive drum from the image receiving body. When toner is reverse transferred from an image receiving body onto a photoconductive drum and sticks to a charging roller or enters a developing unit it causes problems such as potential irregularities and degrades image quality. To prevent such problems conventional color laser printers include a cleaning device for reclaiming residual toner on a photoconductive drum.

Meanwhile as described above a cleaner less method or configuration see for example patent document 1 makes it possible to reduce the size of an image forming apparatus to reduce waste toner and to reduce toner consumption per page.

The cleaner less method or configuration is also applicable to a color image forming apparatus using an intermediate transfer body.

In a color image forming apparatus toner images of different colors are formed by multiple image forming units transferred to and superposed on an intermediate transfer body in sequence and then transferred together onto a recording medium by a secondary transfer member. One problem in employing a cleaner less configuration in such a color image forming apparatus is that if toner on the intermediate transfer body or an image receiving body is transferred back onto a photoconductive drum and enters a developing unit toners of different colors are mixed in the developing unit and cause a color shift.

Patent document 4 tries to solve the above problem. An image forming apparatus disclosed in patent document 4 is configured to measure the amount of reverse transferred toner on a developing roller based on the operating time of the image forming apparatus the areas of images formed and the charge amount of a developer. When the measured amount of reverse transferred toner reaches a predetermined limit the disclosed image forming apparatus removes reverse transferred toner on the developing roller either by forming a solid image on a photoconductive drum and transferring the solid image onto a recording medium a conveyor belt or an intermediate transfer belt or by separating the photoconductive drum and the developing roller and then rotating the developing roller alone.

However it is generally difficult to correctly measure the amount of reverse transferred toner since it is influenced by the aging of toner. Also in a cleaner less image forming apparatus where a developing unit reclaims residual toner on a photoconductive drum after transferring a toner image and while developing another toner image if toner from an upstream developing unit is mixed with toner in a downstream developing unit it causes a color shift in the downstream developing unit.

Embodiments of the present invention provide an image forming apparatus and a process cartridge used in the image forming apparatus that solve or reduce one or more problems caused by the limitations and disadvantages of the related art.

An embodiment of the present invention provides an image forming apparatus that includes an image carrier a toner image forming unit configured to form a toner image having a predetermined polarity on the image carrier an intermediate transfer body facing the image carrier a primary transfer member configured to transfer the toner image on the image carrier onto the intermediate transfer body a secondary transfer member configured to transfer the toner image on the intermediate transfer body onto a recording medium and a contacting member that is in contact with the image carrier and configured to remove residual toner remaining on the image carrier after the toner image is transferred by the primary transfer member onto the intermediate transfer body and to pass the removed residual toner to the intermediate transfer body to which contacting member a bias voltage with the same polarity as the predetermined polarity of the toner image is applied.

Another embodiment of the present invention provides a process cartridge that includes an image carrier a toner image forming unit configured to form a toner image having a predetermined polarity on the image carrier a contacting member that is in contact with the image carrier and configured to remove residual toner remaining on the image carrier after the toner image is transferred onto an image receiving body and a bias applying unit configured to apply a bias voltage with the same polarity as the predetermined polarity of the toner image to the contacting member.

Still another embodiment of the present invention provides an image forming apparatus that includes an image carrier an endless belt a transfer member configured to transfer a toner image on the image carrier onto the endless belt a contacting member that is in contact with the image carrier and configured to remove residual toner remaining on the image carrier after the toner image is transferred and to cause the removed residual toner to fall onto the endless belt by gravity the contacting member being implemented by a sheet part a roller brush or a roller and a toner reclaiming unit configured to reclaim and store the residual toner that has fallen onto the endless belt.

Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

An exposing unit used as a latent image forming unit exposes the photoconductor according to image data and thereby forms an electrostatic latent image. For example a LED or a laser beam scanner implemented by a laser diode is used to expose the photoconductor .

A one component contact developing unit used as a toner image forming unit develops the electrostatic latent image on the photoconductor with a developing bias may be either a plus or minus voltage supplied from a high voltage power supply not shown and thereby forms a toner image. The developing unit for example initially contains about 180 g of one component toner.

The photoconductor the charging unit and the developing unit are integrated as a process unit . Four process units corresponding to yellow Y magenta M cyan C and black Bk are provided in the image forming apparatus . When forming a full color image the image forming apparatus forms yellow magenta cyan and black toner images in the order mentioned on the photoconductors and transfers and superposes the toner images onto an intermediate transfer belt being always in contact with the photoconductors .

The intermediate transfer belt is used as an intermediate transfer body and is stretched over a drive secondary transfer roller a cleaning roller made of a metal primary transfer rollers used as primary transfer members and a tension roller . The intermediate transfer belt is rotated by a drive motor not shown via the drive secondary transfer roller . The tension roller is biased by springs at both its ends to tension the intermediate transfer belt . The tension roller for example is made of an aluminum pipe with a diameter of about 20 mm and has collars not shown having a diameter of about 24 mm. The collars are pressed into the ends of the tension roller and function as movement limiting parts that prevent the intermediate transfer belt from moving sideways.

As the drive secondary transfer roller a polyurethane rubber coated roller e.g. with a coating thickness between 0.3 and 1 mm and a thin layer coated roller e.g. with a coating thickness between 0.03 and 0.1 mm may be used. Also a urethane coated roller e.g. with a coating thickness of 0.05 mm and a diameter of 20 mm whose diameter is less susceptible to temperature change is more preferably used as the drive secondary transfer roller . In this embodiment it is assumed that a urethane coated roller is used as the drive secondary transfer roller .

Each of the primary transfer rollers may be implemented by for example a conductive blade a conductive sponge roller or a metal roller. In this embodiment a metal roller with a diameter of about 8 mm is used. Each of the primary transfer rollers is offset for example 8 mm from the corresponding photoconductor in the direction of movement of the intermediate transfer belt and is offset for example 1 mm from the corresponding photoconductor in the vertically upward direction. A transfer bias of for example between 500 and 1000 V is applied to the primary transfer rollers from one high voltage power supply not shown to form a transfer electric field via the intermediate transfer belt and thereby to transfer toner images on the photoconductors to the intermediate transfer belt .

A toner mark TM sensor is implemented by for example a specular reflection sensor or a diffusion sensor and configured to measure the densities and positions of toner images of different colors on the intermediate transfer belt to adjust the densities and positions.

An intermediate transfer belt cleaning unit removes post transfer residual toner on the intermediate transfer belt by scraping the residual toner with a cleaning blade . The cleaning blade is for example made of polyurethane rubber with a thickness between 1.5 and 3 mm and a hardness between 65 and 80 and is pressed against the intermediate transfer belt . The residual toner scraped by the cleaning blade goes through a toner carrying path not shown and is stored in a waste toner container . A lubricant a toner or a coating agent such as zinc stearate is applied during the manufacturing process at least to the edge of the cleaning blade or a portion of the intermediate transfer belt corresponding to a cleaning nip where the cleaning blade and the intermediate transfer belt come close to or contact each other to prevent the cleaning blade from riding up at the cleaning nip and to improve the cleaning performance by forming a dam layer on the portion corresponding to the cleaning nip.

The rollers over which the intermediate transfer belt is stretched are supported by side boards on the sides of the intermediate transfer belt .

The intermediate transfer belt is for example an endless belt of a resin film made by dispersing a conductive material such as carbon black in polyvinylidene difluoride PVDF polyethylene tetrafluoroethylene ETFE polyimide PI polycarbonate PC or thermoplastic elastomer TPE . In this embodiment the intermediate transfer belt is made by adding carbon black to TPE with a tensile modulus between 1000 and 2000 MPa. The intermediate transfer belt of this embodiment has a single layer structure a thickness between 100 and 200 m and a width of 230 mm.

The volume resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt is preferably between 10and 10 cm and the surface resistivity is preferably between 10and 10 sq. both measured with HIRESTA UP MCP HT450 of Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation by applying a voltage of 500 V for 10 seconds . If the volume resistivity and the surface resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt are larger than the ranges mentioned above the intermediate transfer belt becomes charged and therefore it becomes necessary to gradually increase the voltage applied to the primary transfer rollers from upstream to downstream in terms of the toner image transfer process. Also in this case it may become necessary to use multiple power supplies to apply different voltages to the primary transfer rollers . This problem occurs because the electrostatic potential on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt increases because of discharge which occurs when toner images are transferred or a recording medium is peeled off to such an extent that it becomes difficult for the intermediate transfer belt to self discharge. This in turn makes it necessary to provide a discharging unit for discharging the intermediate transfer belt . On the other hand if the volume resistivity and the surface resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt are smaller than the ranges mentioned above the electrostatic potential on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt decays sooner and therefore it is preferable in terms of self discharging. However with such low resistivity the electric current flows in the plane direction during toner image transfer and toner on the intermediate transfer belt may scatter. For these reasons the volume resistivity and the surface resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt are preferably within the above mentioned ranges.

A secondary transfer roller is for example made by coating a metal core bar of stainless used steel SUS with an elastic body such as urethane whose resistance is adjusted by a conductive material to fall within a range between 10and 10 . For example the secondary transfer roller may be implemented by an ion conductive roller made of urethane carbon dispersion nitrile butadien rubber NBR or Hydrin or an electronic conductive roller made of ethylene propylene terpolymer EPDM . In this embodiment a urethane roller with a diameter of 20 mm and an Asker C hardness between 35 and 50 is used as the secondary transfer roller . If the volume resistivity and the surface resistivity of the secondary transfer roller are larger than the ranges mentioned above the passage of an electric current is hampered and it becomes necessary to apply a higher voltage to properly transfer toner images. This in turn increases the power supply cost. Also if a high voltage is applied a discharge occurs in a gap before or after a transfer nip where the secondary transfer roller and the intermediate transfer belt come close to or contact each other and causes white spots on a halftone image formed on a recording medium. This problem is especially prominent in a low temperature and low humidity environment e.g. 10 C. 15 RH . On the other hand if the volume resistivity and the surface resistivity of the secondary transfer roller are smaller than the ranges mentioned above it becomes difficult to transfer both a multi color portion e.g. composed of three colors and a single color portion of an image with the same quality. While a single color portion of an image can be transferred with a low voltage or with a low transfer current a voltage higher than the optimum voltage for a single color portion is necessary to properly transfer a multi color portion of an image. If a voltage high enough to transfer a multi color portion is used the transfer current becomes too high for a single color portion and the efficiency in transferring toner images is reduced.

The resistivity of the secondary transfer roller can be obtained for example by placing the secondary transfer roller on a conductive metal plate applying a load of 4.9 N to each end of the metal core bar of the secondary transfer roller and measuring the current that flows between the metal core bar and the metal plate when a voltage of 1 kV is applied between them.

A recording medium is fed by a paper feed roller and resist rollers at a timing when the leading edge of a toner image on the intermediate transfer belt reaches a secondary transfer position and a transfer bias voltage is applied from a high voltage power supply not shown to the secondary transfer roller to transfer the toner image to the recording medium . The recording medium is separated from the intermediate transfer belt by the curvature of the drive secondary transfer roller . Then fusing rollers of a fusing unit fuse the toner image onto the recording medium and eject the recording medium .

In this embodiment the amount of time used for the fusing process is changeable according to the type of the recording medium . For example when the grammage of the recording medium is greater than 100 g m the recording medium is caused to pass through a fusing nip or a gap between the fusing rollers at half of the normal speed so that the toner image is securely fused on the recording medium .

A test apparatus having substantially the same configuration as that of the image forming apparatus shown in was prepared to perform experiments. A sheet part was provided for each of plural photoconductors and positioned upstream of a charging brush roller so as to be in contact with the corresponding photoconductor. A monochrome halftone image was printed in succession on 3 000 sheets of A4 size paper by each of the photoconductors with an exposure temperature between 22 and 25 C. and an environmental humidity between 50 and 70 . The percentage of the area occupied by the monochrome halftone image on the A4 size paper was 5 . Then for each of the sheet parts the degree of a ghost image on the 3 000th page was evaluated. To indicate the degree of a ghost image the following marks were used indicating that no ghost image is visible indicating that a faint ghost image is visible and x indicating that a ghost image is clearly visible. Also the number of black lines appearing on an image which black lines are caused by a tainted charging brush roller was used to indicate the effectiveness of the sheet parts i.e. how effectively post transfer residual toner and reverse transferred toner are scraped by the sheet parts . Such black lines appear on the monochrome halftone image for example if black Bk toner adheres to a portion of the sheet part in a Bk process unit and as a result oppositely charged black toner accumulates on a corresponding portion of the charging brush roller. In this experiment the following marks were used to indicate the number of black lines on the monochrome halftone image printed on the 3 000th page indicating that the number of black lines is 0 indicating that the number of black lines is 1 to 2 and x indicating the number of black lines is more than 3. Also as a comparative example an experiment was performed in the same manner using a blade instead of a sheet part. As a blade a SUS plate with a thickness of 100 m a mounting angle of 17 and a cut in depth of 0.5 mm was used.

As the black toner spherical toner particles having an average diameter of 6 m and coated with a sizing agent were used. Each of the photoconductors was prepared by stacking an underlying layer with a thickness of 3 m a charge generation layer with a thickness of 0.2 m and a charge transport layer with a thickness of 23 m in this order on a drum. The capacitance of the photoconductors was 110 pF cm. The photoconductors were rotated at a linear velocity of 120 mm s during printing.

The charging brush roller was prepared by implanting conductive fibers into a rotational shaft with a diameter of 5 mm. The external diameter of the charging brush roller was 11 mm. As a charging bias applied to the charging brush roller an AC voltage with a superimposed DC voltage Vdc of 500 V was used. The AC voltage had a peak to peak voltage level Vpp of 1.0 kV a printing time frequency of 300 Hz a non printing time between recording media frequency of 10 Hz and a duty cycle of 45 . Decreasing the frequency from 300 Hz during printing to 10 Hz in an interval between recording media makes it possible for the charging brush roller to release toner adhering to itself onto the photoconductor. The released toner is reclaimed by the developing unit from the photoconductor. However it is difficult to reclaim low charged toner. Also even when the frequency is decreased to 10 Hz oppositely charged toner is not released from the charging brush roller and accumulates on the charging brush roller.

As the sheet part a conductive sheet with a thickness of 0.1 mm and made of a material obtained by dispersing carbon powder used as a conductive material in polyvinylidene difluoride PVDF was used. The volume resistivity of the conductive sheet was between 105 and 107 cm and the surface resistivity was 102 sq. The results of the above experiments are shown in table 1 below as examples 1 through 3 and comparative examples 1 through 4.

Biases having the same polarity as the charge polarity of toner were applied to the sheet parts and the blade. When voltages of 300 V and 500 V were applied respectively to the sheet parts in examples 1 and 2 no ghost image or black line was observed. When voltages lower than 300 V were applied to the sheet parts both ghost images and black lines were observed. It is assumed that this is because potential irregularities on the photoconductor just after image transfer cannot be corrected if an applied bias is low. It is also assumed that black lines appear on the monochrome halftone image when almost no bias is applied to the sheet part because post transfer residual toner and reverse transferred toner are not attracted to the sheet part and since the mechanical strength of the sheet part is low easily pass by the sheet part and taint the charging brush roller.

When biases higher than 500 V were applied no ghost image was observed. With a bias higher than 700 V however many black lines were observed. It is assumed that this is because oppositely charged toner sticks to the edge of the sheet part if the applied bias is too high changes the strength of the edge of the sheet part and thereby causes the toner to slip by the sheet part and taint the charging brush roller.

When the blade was used instead of the sheet part in comparative example 4 ghost images and a couple of black lines were observed. It is assumed that this is because potential irregularities on the photoconductor just after image transfer cannot be corrected since no bias is applied to the blade. Also with the blade the post transfer residual toner and the reverse transferred toner were not removed satisfactorily.

As the results show applying a bias voltage between 300 and 700 V to a sheet part makes it possible to correct potential irregularities on the photoconductor which irregularities cause ghost images and to efficiently remove and cause the post transfer residual toner and the reverse transferred toner to fall onto the intermediate transfer belt by gravity. Also using a sheet part in contact with the photoconductor to remove and cause residual toner on the photoconductor to fall onto the intermediate transfer belt makes it possible to implement a cleaner less developing system with a minimum configuration and at low costs.

Also in this embodiment sheet parts and are provided only for the magenta photoconductor and the cyan photoconductor and not provided for the yellow photoconductor positioned most upstream and the black photoconductor positioned most downstream . Even with this configuration the yellow toner in the developing unit corresponding to the yellow photoconductor is not mixed with toner of another color. The black photoconductor is configured to reclaim the magenta toner and the cyan toner that are passed to the intermediate transfer belt . Even if the black toner is mixed with toner of a different color the influence is very small. Rather reclaiming toner by the black photoconductor makes it possible to reduce toner consumption and has an advantage in terms of ecology. Further since this embodiment requires the sheet parts only for two photoconductors it is possible to reduce the size and costs of an image forming apparatus.

In the above embodiments it is preferable to apply a bias voltage to a sheet part used as a contacting member before residual toner reaches a position where the sheet part touches a photoconductor used as an image carrier. Also in the above embodiments a sheet part is pre charged by a bias voltage. However a sheet part may also be used to charge a photoconductor. Although a sheet part having a low mechanical strength is most preferable as a contacting member a brush or a blade may also be used as a contacting member. As described above a sheet part or a contacting member that removes residual toner is preferably in contact with a photoconductor or an image carrier in a forward direction that is opposite to a counter direction with respect to the rotational direction of the photoconductor. However depending on the material of the photoconductor or other conditions the sheet part may be brought into contact with the photoconductor in a counter direction with respect to the rotational direction of the photoconductor to efficiently scrape and hold residual toner on the photoconductor.

Examples of materials used for a sheet part include nylon 6 nylon 12 vinylon saran rayon polyethylene acrylic resin and fluoroplastics e.g. PVDF PFA and PTFE .

Another embodiment of the present invention provides an image forming apparatus including cleaner less process cartridges corresponding to different colors each of which process cartridges includes an image carrier and a developing unit but does not include a cleaning device for removing toner remaining on the image carrier after image transfer. In the image forming apparatus toner images of different colors are formed on the image carriers by the developing units of the process cartridges which process cartridges are positioned vertically above an intermediate transfer body and the formed toner images are transferred to and superposed on the intermediate transfer body. A contacting member is provided for at least one of the image carriers which contacting member is in contact with the corresponding image carrier and positioned upstream of a charging unit. A bias voltage is applied to the contacting member. The contacting member is configured to remove toner remaining on the image carrier after image transfer and pass the removed toner to the intermediate transfer body. This configuration makes it possible to prevent toner of one color in a developing unit from being mixed with reverse transferred toner of another color. Also applying a bias voltage to the contacting member improves efficiency in passing residual toner to the intermediate transfer body and makes it possible to reduce potential irregularities on the image carrier just after image transfer and thereby to reduce formation of ghost images.

In the image forming apparatus described above the contacting member in contact with the image carrier is preferably positioned so as not to contact the intermediate transfer body. This configuration prevents the contacting member from disturbing toner images on the intermediate transfer body. Also the contacting member may be configured to cause residual toner to fall onto the intermediate transfer body by gravity. Further a primary transfer member of the image forming apparatus and the corresponding image carrier are preferably offset from each other and the primary transfer member is preferably configured to cause the intermediate transfer body to form a primary transfer nip with the image carrier without directly pressing the image carrier. This configuration makes it possible to increase the area of contact or the width of the transfer nip between the image carrier and the intermediate transfer body to reduce a pre nip discharge and thereby to reduce generation of positively polarized toner that is easily reverse transferred. Alternatively when the primary transfer member is directly below the image carrier it is possible to prevent degradation of image quality by distributing the pressure evenly within the transfer nip.

The image forming apparatus described above may be configured such that the toner images transferred onto the intermediate transfer body are then transferred onto a recording medium and the contacting member is integrated with the process cartridge and is in contact with the image carrier at a position downstream of the primary transfer nip.

Still another embodiment of the present invention provides an image forming apparatus including process cartridges corresponding to different colors each of which process cartridges includes an image carrier and a developing unit and is positioned vertically above an intermediate transfer body disposed so as to form an angle with the bottom surface of the image forming apparatus. In the image forming apparatus toner images of different colors are formed on the image carriers by the developing units of the process cartridges and the formed toner images are transferred to and superposed on the intermediate transfer body. A cleaning part is provided for at least one of the image carriers. The cleaning part is in contact with the corresponding image carrier in approximately the middle of the cleaning part and is configured to remove and temporarily hold toner remaining on the image carrier after image transfer. The toner held by the cleaning part is passed to the intermediate transfer body when the image carrier is rotated in the reverse direction at predetermined intervals or at a predetermined timing . This configuration makes it possible to provide a small and low cost cleaning mechanism that prevents toner of one color in a developing unit from being mixed with reverse transferred toner of another color.

In this image forming apparatus the image carrier is preferably rotated in the reverse direction at such a timing that the removed residual toner falls onto a non image area of the intermediate transfer body. This configuration makes it possible to prevent toner images on the intermediate transfer body from being disturbed. The predetermined intervals at which the image carrier is rotated in the reverse direction may correspond to the intervals of control processes. In other words the image carrier may be rotated in the reverse direction before and after a control process. In the present application a control process indicates a process for adjusting various characteristics of an image forming apparatus which characteristics influence image quality. For example a control process is performed to align recording heads to adjust toner concentration to correct gamma or to adjust fusing temperature. The intervals or the timing may also be determined based on a cumulative number of rotations of an image carrier or a cumulative number of rotations of an intermediate transfer body. Further the image forming apparatus described above may be configured to apply a bias voltage to the cleaning part when the image carrier is rotated in the reverse direction to help the residual toner removed by the cleaning part to fall onto the intermediate transfer body.

Thus embodiments of the present invention provide an image forming apparatus and a process cartridge used in the image forming apparatus that make it possible to prevent toner of one color remaining on an image carrier after image transfer from being mixed with toner of a different color in a developing unit and causing a color shift. At the same time embodiments of the present invention make it possible to reduce the size of an image forming apparatus and to provide an ecologically friendly image forming apparatus that can reduce toner consumption and reduce or substantially eliminate waste toner.

In an image forming apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention a contacting member is provided at least for one of image carriers to which contacting member a bias voltage is applied. The contacting member is configured to remove reverse transferred toner on the corresponding image carrier and to pass the removed toner to an intermediate transfer body. This configuration effectively prevents toner of one color in a developing unit from being mixed with reverse transferred toner of another color.

A one component contact developing unit develops the electrostatic latent image on the photoconductive drum with a developing bias supplied from a high voltage power supply not shown and thereby forms a toner image. The developing unit for example initially contains about 180 g of polyester one component toner. The photoconductive drum the charging unit and the developing unit are integrated as a process cartridge . Four process cartridges A B C and D corresponding to yellow Y magenta M cyan C and black Bk are provided in the image forming apparatus . When forming a full color image the image forming apparatus forms yellow magenta cyan and black toner images on the photoconductive drums in the order mentioned and transfers and superposes the toner images onto an intermediate transfer belt being always in contact with the photoconductive drums .

The intermediate transfer belt is used as an intermediate transfer body and is stretched over a drive secondary transfer roller a cleaning roller primary transfer rollers used as primary transfer members and a tension roller . The intermediate transfer belt is rotated by a drive motor not shown via the drive secondary transfer roller . The tension roller is biased by springs at both its ends to tension the intermediate transfer belt . The tension roller for example is made of an aluminum pipe with a diameter of about 20 mm and has collars having a diameter of about 24 mm. The collars are pressed into the ends of the tension roller and function as movement limiting parts that prevent the intermediate transfer belt from moving sideways.

As the drive secondary transfer roller a polyurethane rubber coated roller e.g. with a coating thickness between 0.3 and 1 mm and a thin layer coated roller e.g. with a coating thickness between 0.03 and 0.1 mm may be used. Also a urethane coated roller e.g. with a coating thickness of 0.05 mm and a diameter of 20 mm whose diameter is less susceptible to temperature change is more preferably used as the drive secondary transfer roller . Each of the primary transfer rollers may be implemented by for example a conductive blade a conductive sponge roller or a metal roller. In this embodiment a metal roller with a diameter of about 8 mm is used. Each of the primary transfer rollers is offset for example 8 mm from the corresponding photoconductive drum in the direction of movement of the intermediate transfer belt and is offset for example 1 mm from the corresponding photoconductive drum in the vertically upward direction. A transfer bias of for example between 500 and 1000 V is applied to the primary transfer rollers from one high voltage power supply not shown to form a transfer electric field via the intermediate transfer belt and thereby to transfer toner images on the photoconductive drums to the intermediate transfer belt .

Sheet parts are provided for the photoconductive drums . Each of the sheet parts is disposed downstream of a primary transfer area and is configured to remove post transfer residual toner and reverse transferred toner on the photoconductive drum and to pass the removed toner to the intermediate transfer belt . The toner passed to the intermediate transfer belt by an upstream process cartridge may be reclaimed by a downstream process cartridge . In this case it is preferable to positively charge polyester toner having a negative polarity. Also in this case the sheet part is preferably made of polyurethane or a fluoroplastic e.g. PVDF PFA or PTFE that is ranked lower closer to the most negatively charged side in the triboelectric series than polyester. Especially a fluoroplastic which is a highly negative material is preferably used.

A toner mark TM sensor is implemented by for example a specular reflection sensor or a diffusion sensor and configured to measure the densities and positions of toner images of different colors on the intermediate transfer belt to adjust the densities and positions. An intermediate transfer belt cleaning unit removes post transfer residual toner on the intermediate transfer belt by scraping the toner with a cleaning blade . The cleaning blade is for example made of polyurethane rubber with a thickness between 1.5 and 3 mm and a hardness between 65 and 80 and is pressed against the intermediate transfer belt . The residual toner scraped by the cleaning blade goes through a toner carrying path not shown and is stored in a waste toner container . A lubricant toner or a coating agent such as zinc stearate is applied during the manufacturing process at least to the edge of the cleaning blade or a portion of the intermediate transfer belt corresponding to a cleaning nip where the cleaning blade and the intermediate transfer belt come close to or contact each other to prevent the cleaning blade from riding up at the cleaning nip and to improve the cleaning performance by forming a dam layer on the portion corresponding to the cleaning nip. The rollers over which the intermediate transfer belt is stretched are supported by side boards on the sides of the intermediate transfer belt .

The intermediate transfer belt is an endless belt of a resin film made for example by dispersing a conductive material such as carbon black in polyvinylidene difluoride PVDF polyethylene tetrafluoroethylene ETFE polyimide PI polycarbonate PC or thermoplastic elastomer TPE . In this embodiment the intermediate transfer belt is made of a material obtained by adding carbon black to TPE with a tensile modulus between 1000 and 2000 MPa. The intermediate transfer belt of this embodiment has a single layer structure a thickness between 100 and 200 m and a width of 230 mm.

The volume resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt is preferably between 10and 10 cm and the surface resistivity is preferably between 10and 10 sq. both measured with HIRESTA UP MCP HT450 of Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation by applying a voltage of 500 V for 10 seconds . If the volume resistivity and the surface resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt are larger than the ranges mentioned above the intermediate transfer belt becomes charged and therefore it becomes necessary to gradually increase the voltage applied to the primary transfer rollers from upstream to downstream in terms of the toner image transfer process. Also in this case it may become necessary to use multiple power supplies to apply different voltages to the primary transfer rollers . This problem occurs because the electrostatic potential on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt increases because of discharge which occurs when toner images are transferred or a recording medium is peeled off to such an extent that it becomes difficult for the intermediate transfer belt to self discharge. This in turn makes it necessary to provide a discharging unit for discharging the intermediate transfer belt . On the other hand if the volume resistivity and the surface resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt are smaller than the ranges mentioned above the electrostatic potential on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt decays sooner and therefore it is preferable in terms of self discharging. However with such low resistivity the electric current flows in the plane direction during toner image transfer and toner on the intermediate transfer belt may scatter. For these reasons the volume resistivity and the surface resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt are preferably within the above mentioned ranges.

A secondary transfer roller is for example made by coating a metal core bar of stainless used steel SUS with an elastic body such as urethane whose resistance is adjusted by a conductive material to fall within a range between 10and 10 . For example the secondary transfer roller may be implemented by an ion conductive roller made of urethane carbon dispersion nitrile butadien rubber NBR or Hydrin or an electronic conductive roller made of ethylene propylene terpolymer EPDM . In this embodiment a urethane roller with a diameter of 20 mm and an Asker C hardness between 35 and 50 is used as the secondary transfer roller . If the volume resistivity and the surface resistivity of the secondary transfer roller are larger than the ranges mentioned above the passage of an electric current is hampered and it becomes necessary to apply a higher voltage to properly transfer toner images. This in turn increases the power supply cost. Also if a high voltage is applied a discharge occurs in a gap before or after a transfer nip where the secondary transfer roller and the intermediate transfer belt come close to or contact each other and causes white spots on a halftone image formed on a recording medium. This problem is especially prominent in a low temperature and low humidity environment e.g. 10 C. 15 RH . On the other hand if the volume resistivity and the surface resistivity of the secondary transfer roller are smaller than the ranges mentioned above it becomes difficult to transfer both a multi color portion e.g. composed of three colors and a single color portion of an image with the same quality. While a single color portion of an image can be transferred with a low voltage or with a low transfer current a voltage higher than the optimum voltage for a single color portion is necessary to properly transfer a multi color portion of an image. If a voltage high enough to transfer a multi color portion is used the transfer current becomes too high for a single color portion and the efficiency in transferring toner images is reduced.

The resistivity of the secondary transfer roller can be obtained for example by placing the secondary transfer roller on a conductive metal plate applying a load of 4.9 N to each end of the metal core bar of the secondary transfer roller and measuring the current that flows between the metal core bar and the metal plate when a voltage of 1 kV is applied between them.

A recording medium is fed by a paper feed roller and resist rollers at a timing when the leading edge of a toner image on the intermediate transfer belt reaches a secondary transfer position and a transfer bias voltage is applied from a high voltage power supply not shown to the secondary transfer roller to transfer the toner image to the recording medium . The recording medium is separated from the intermediate transfer belt by the curvature of the drive secondary transfer roller . Then fusing rollers of a fusing unit fuse the toner image onto the recording medium and eject the recording medium .

In this embodiment the amount of time used for the fusing process is changeable according to the type of the recording medium . For example when the grammage of the recording medium is greater than 100 g m the recording medium is caused to pass through a fusing nip or a gap between the fusing rollers at half of the normal speed so that the toner image is securely fused on the recording medium .

With the configuration described above even if toner on the intermediate transfer belt is reverse transferred onto the photoconductive drum the reverse transferred toner is scraped and passed to the intermediate transfer belt by the sheet part of the process cartridge . The toner is then carried by the intermediate transfer belt is scraped by the cleaning blade of the intermediate transfer belt cleaning unit and is stored through a toner carrying path in the waste toner container the intermediate transfer belt cleaning unit and the waste toner container may collectively be called a toner reclaiming unit . Thus this configuration prevents post transfer residual toner from entering the developing unit and mixing with toner of a different color and thereby prevents a color shift in the developing unit .

Also the above configuration eliminates the need to provide a cleaning device with a housing as disclosed in patent document 2 and requires only the sheet part for removing residual toner on the photoconductive drum and therefore makes it possible to simplify and reduce the size of an image forming apparatus. In other words the above configuration makes it possible to reduce the number of components of an image forming apparatus and to reduce the production costs.

Types and configurations of image forming apparatuses provided by the present invention are not limited to those described in the above embodiments. Also an image carrier other than a photoconductive drum and an intermediate transfer body other than an intermediate transfer belt may be used in an image forming apparatus according to the present invention. Further the retracting mechanism described in the ninth embodiment may also be applied to other embodiments.

Embodiments of the present invention provide an image forming apparatus and a process cartridge used in the image forming apparatus that make it possible to prevent toner of one color remaining on an image carrier after image transfer from being mixed with toner of a different color in a developing unit and causing a color shift. At the same time embodiments of the present invention make it possible to reduce the size of an image forming apparatus and to provide an ecologically friendly image forming apparatus that can reduce toner consumption and reduce or substantially eliminate waste toner.

Embodiments of the present invention provide an image forming apparatus including a contacting member for removing residual toner on an image carrier and passing the removed toner to an endless belt and a toner reclaiming unit for reclaiming and storing the toner passed to the endless belt. The contacting member is in contact with the image carrier and causes the residual toner on the image carrier to fall onto the endless belt by gravity. The contacting member may be implemented by a sheet part a roller brush a roller or a blade. This configuration makes it possible to prevent toner of one color in a developing unit from being mixed with reverse transferred toner of another color. Also this configuration eliminates the need to provide a cleaning device with a housing as disclosed in patent document 2 and requires only a contacting member for removing residual toner on an image carrier. Therefore this configuration makes it possible to reduce the size and costs of an image forming apparatus. Using a sheet part as a contacting member makes it possible to use an inexpensive and flexible material to implement a mechanism for removing toner or charging toner to an opposite polarity. Using a roller brush as a contacting member makes it possible to increase a nip between the contacting member and an image carrier and thereby to improve the toner removing performance of the contacting member. Using a roller as a contacting member makes it possible to disperse removed toner when passing it to an intermediate transfer body.

The present invention is not limited to the specifically disclosed embodiments and variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
