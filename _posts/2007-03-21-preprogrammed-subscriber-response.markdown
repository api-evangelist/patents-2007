The embodiments of the invention relate generally to communications processing and more specifically to pre programmed subscriber responses to received communications.

Conventional communication systems conventionally have two options when a call is received at a subscriber s communication device. Specifically the call can be answered or the call can be allowed to go to a voice messaging system. Additionally conventional systems allow certain options to control when these actions occur. For example a subscriber may forward his phone to voicemail to prevent interruptions. Also some centralized phone management systems allow for different messages to be generated based upon the time and or date such as an after hours message may be played when a business is not open. Further conventional systems also allow subscribers to select specific ring tones to identify the source of an incoming call. Based upon these customized ring tones a subscriber may answer or ignore a call.

Although there are many circumstances where these options are sufficient there are also situations where a more personal and or contextually accurate response would be preferable. These situations may be more prevalent in conjunction with mobile terminals that allow access to subscribers in a variety of situations. For example a fixed terminal e.g. a land line phone in an office has limited situational context when the subscriber is available to receive a call i.e. the subscriber is present or not present in his office . However with mobile terminals subscribers may have the ability to answer the call in variety of places situations e.g. meeting theater or restaurant where they do not wish or are not permitted to answer the call.

Accordingly it would be beneficial to allow for more options for responses when a call is received at a subscriber terminal.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention includes a method including receiving a communication identifying the communication associating the communication with a pre programmed response and responding to the communication using the pre programmed response.

Another embodiment of the invention includes an apparatus including logic configured to receive a communication logic configured to identify the communication logic configured to associate the communication with a pre programmed response and logic configured to respond to the communication using the pre programmed response.

Another embodiment of the invention includes a computer readable media embodying a method for pre programmed subscriber responses. The method can include receiving a communication identifying the communication associating the communication with a pre programmed response and responding to the communication using the pre programmed response.

Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally well known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.

The word exemplary is used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any embodiment described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise the terms embodiments and embodiments of the invention do not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A High Data Rate HDR subscriber station referred to herein as an access terminal AT may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations referred to herein as modem pool transceivers MPTs or base stations BS . An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller referred to as a modem pool controller MPC base station controller and or mobile switching center MSC . Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network can transports data packets to and between multiple access terminals.

The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network such as a corporate intranet or the Internet and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card compact flash external or internal modem or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.

Referring back to the components of the wireless network and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals such as wireless client computing devices to communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components connected via the air interface and RAN including without limitation wireless network carrier the Internet and or other remote servers.

The RAN controls messages conventionally sent as data packets sent to a MPC MSC . The carrier network may communicate with the MPC MSC by a network the Internet and or a public switched telephone network PSTN . Alternatively the MPC MSC may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Conventionally the network or Internet connection between the carrier network and the MPC MSC transfers data and the PSTN transfers voice information. The MPC MSC can be connected to multiple base stations BS or modem pool transceivers MPT . In a similar manner to the carrier network the MPC MSC is conventionally connected to the MPT BS by a network the Internet and or PSTN for data transfer and or voice information. The MPT BS can broadcast voice and data messages wirelessly to the access terminals such as cellular telephone . The MPT BS MPC MSC and other components may form the RAN as is known in the art. However alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated.

Referring to the access terminal such as a cellular telephone has a platform that can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the carrier network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database is conventionally a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like. The internal platform components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna display keypad push to talk button audio input and audio output among other components as is known in the art.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the access terminal in are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

As discussed in the background section conventional systems provide limited alternatives for responding to incoming calls. For example most subscribers in a meeting or at a theater will look at who is calling and then either ignore the call or excuse themselves to take the call privately. However embodiments of the invention provide the ability to customize responses in advance which can be stored either at the phone the carrier and or other remote server coupled to the communication network. In one embodiment this allows the subscriber to examine who is calling and select a preprogrammed response when the call is received. For example the message may say In a meeting I ll call you back in an hour or I am not familiar with your phone number if this is a sales call please take me off your list . Additionally embodiments of the invention can provide for automatic responses and contextually based selections based on the identity of the caller.

For example using the phone or network storage the subscriber can record custom voice messages. Each voice message can be given a unique index. When a call is received the subscriber has the ability to choose to answer ignore or send one of the pre programmed voice messages. The choice can be selected interactively by the subscriber or can be automatically determined based on the caller s identity e.g. via caller ID .

The following description of embodiments of the invention is directed mainly to voice calls and pre programmed messages in response thereto. However the invention is not limited to these examples. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the embodiments of the invention can include text messaging Voice Over Internet Protocol VoIP calls push to talk PTT calls and the like. Accordingly the examples provided herein are solely for purposes of illustration of embodiments of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments.

Referring to a flowchart illustrating aspects of the invention is provided. A communication is received . The communication is identified . The identification can be extracting a caller ID phone number or name. Alternatively the identification can involve determining the type of communication e.g. voice call text message PTT VoIP and identity data e.g. caller ID phone number name email address Internet Protocol IP address . Using the identity and or communication type information the response can be determined. For example a voice call may be identified by name based on the phone number and the information that is stored on the access terminal e.g. in a contact list . The access terminal can also store information such as a category e.g. Personal Business also in a contact list which can be associated with identification data e.g. phone number name and used to select the pre programmed response. The system can then check if an automatic response is programmed for the received communication e.g. based on the caller ID name category and the like . If an automatic response is not selected for the received communication then the identification information for the communication can be displayed at the access terminal . This information may include for example the type of communication e.g. voice call text message source e.g. name phone number and or category of the source e.g. business personal . The subscriber may optionally select a context e.g. meeting theater vacation to refine the selection of appropriate responses . This may be set in advance or selected at the time of the call if this option is available. If this option is available and not pre selected the subscriber can be prompted to select the context see e.g. . After the context is selected or if no context is selected the subscriber can be provided with a list of responses to select see e.g. . Once selected the response can be initiated . For example a pre programmed voice message could tell the caller that the subscriber is in a meeting and will return the call immediately following the meeting. Providing callers with context appropriate response messages may help to avoid problems such as receiving multiple calls from the same caller as many callers will call back repeatedly instead of leaving a voicemail.

In an automatic mode the matter of selecting the response may not require any subscriber interaction. For example based on the communication identifier e.g. caller ID on an incoming call a pre programmed response may be selected and the selected response initiated . The selected response may be the same for all situations or the subscriber may provide some context information that can refine the automatic selection that can be detected and used to limit the responses for selection and then the context appropriate response will be selected .

For example instead of recording specific messages for each event a subscriber may establish a series of alternative responses based on several criteria such as a context e.g. meeting theater etc. type of communication e.g. voice call text message etc. and specific identity or category of the caller. In one example the context can be a Vacation the communication can be a voice call and the caller can be in a Personal category. Given these parameters the call may be passed through in a conventional matter which would be the appropriate response. However in an alternate example the context can be a Vacation the communication a voice call and the caller in a Business category. Given these parameters the call may result in the system automatically selecting a prerecorded message that states the end date of the vacation and that the call will be returned on the next business day following the vacation end date. The responses may be reversed in the Meeting context where callers from the Business category may be passed through for review by the subscriber and callers in the Personal category may automatically get a message stating the subscriber is in a meeting and will return the call after the meeting. If one automatic message is assigned for a caller or category then the context the response will be selected based on the communication identifier information. Further even if there are multiple messages for each category a default message for each category can be used in the event no context is selected.

Further in another aspect of the embodiments the audio recorded can be assigned as introductory audio for each contact. If available the introductory audio can be combined with the pre programmed responses to provide a more customized response. For example instead of just getting a pre programmed response telling the caller the subscriber is in a meeting and will call them afterward the introductory audio can personalize the pre programmed response e.g. Hi John then I am in a meeting . . . . Accordingly the caller can receive a more personalized response that also includes an audio indication that the subscriber knows who to respond to.

As discussed above the pre programmed responses can be stored on the access terminal a server or a combination of both. As used herein the term server refers to any device coupled to the communication network and capable of communicating with the access terminal and incoming callers. Likewise the functions described herein may be located on the access terminal a server or a combination of both. For example an automatic mode e.g. as discussed in relation to may be implemented in a server on the carrier network so that calls are screened even before being forwarded to the access terminal. Further in other embodiments the access terminal and a server can work in cooperation. For example to reduce storage and processor load on the access terminal the access terminal can be used as the interface for selection of the pre programmed responses. However the actual storage and processing of the pre programmed response can be performed on the server.

If the subscriber does examine the caller ID the subscriber can determine whether to take the call e.g. pressing a send key and a conventional call is processed or forward it to a conventional mailbox e.g. selecting an ignore soft key where a message can be left on voicemail . However in conjunction with these options the subscriber can also be presented with a list of context and or pre programmed responses see e.g. and . This allows the subscriber the opportunity to select a pre programmed response from the list of pre programmed responses . If the subscriber does not make selection within an allotted time or chooses to not to select from the list the call can be forwarded to the subscriber s voicemail . Providing a timeout function provides the caller with a response within a reasonable time even if no action is taken. From the caller s perspective the call will merely be a missed call that is forwarded to voicemail if no response is selected by the subscriber. Optionally to facilitate an extended time for the subscriber to select a response a message can be played informing the caller to hold for a response. If a response is selected then the selected pre programmed response is retrieved and the response message is provided to the caller allowing the subscriber to provide a response that is more detailed than forwarding a caller to a general voice mail while still allowing the subscriber to continue with his activity with little or no interruption. Once the response is provided the call may be ended or the caller may optionally be forwarded to the voicemail where a message may be left for the subscriber based on the information provided in the pre programmed response. For example a pre programmed response for business contacts may state the subscriber is in a meeting this morning but will return the call that afternoon and may ask that the caller leave a convenient time to be contacted that afternoon in the subscriber s voicemail. In another example the pre programmed response may be even further customized for a specific individual such as John thank you for calling. I am currently in a meeting this morning but I would like to discuss project X with you this afternoon. Please leave a convenient time for me to call you this afternoon in my voicemail or send me an email to confirm a time for our teleconference. This could be selected or set as an automatic pre programmed response for the contact John so that the John would get this message automatically if he called. After the message the call can be forwarded directly to voicemail so that a message can be left for the subscriber.

In a display on an access terminal is illustrated. For example when a communication is received information identifying the communication can be displayed in a portion of the display . The information identifying the communication can include the type of communication .e.g. voice call and the identity of the caller e.g. name phone number . Additionally a first menu of options can be displayed such as a selection of the context for the pre programmed response. As discussed above a selection of a context may be used to refine the available messages. For example if a Meeting context is selected via soft key then the next list of selections see e.g. can be refined to appropriate messages for the meeting context. Alternatively the subscriber can choose to skip this filter e.g. selecting soft key so that all pre programmed messages are displayed.

Referring to assuming the meeting context was selected a list of pre programmed responses for that context can be selected. For example each of these responses may include the indication that the subscriber is in a meeting and will return the call or respond in another manner e.g. meet back at the office . Thus the subscriber can provide the caller with contextually relevant information by selecting one of the pre programmed messages which reduces the subscriber s interruption while providing the caller with more relevant information then just a generic request to leave a message. Further based on the communication identification the list of pre programmed responses can be further refined. For example the list of pre programmed responses for the meeting context may change for ID s in different categories e.g. Business Personal etc. . Likewise a default response or custom response may be associated with a specific contact so that a specific response for that individual may be customized and selected e.g. using soft key such as the forgoing example requesting a caller to confirm a time for a teleconference about a project. However if the subscriber is not satisfied with any of the pre programmed options the subscriber can choose to ignore the call e.g. by selecting soft key or failing to act at which point the call can be forwarded to voicemail.

As will be appreciated from the foregoing examples embodiments of the invention can use multiple criteria to provide robust context driven responses to a wide range of callers in response to received calls. Further leveraging existing information such as the category caller from the contacts manager in the access terminal or on a server reduces both the effort by the subscriber to maintain ID s associated with the pre programmed responses and the memory used storing this data at the access terminal or on a server. For example a subscriber could assign a pre programmed response to categories and the pre programmed response could be used for contacts in that category without specifically associating the pre programmed response with each contact individually.

Also as will be appreciated from the foregoing examples embodiments of the invention can include apparatuses and systems for performing the functions discussed herein. For example an embodiment of the invention can include an apparatus such as the access terminal in including logic configured to receive a communication logic configured to identify the communication logic configured to associate the communication with a pre programmed response and logic configured to respond to the communication using the pre programmed response. However in other embodiments as discussed herein the logic may reside on a server or a combination of both an access terminal and a server in communication with the access terminal. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the functionalities described herein may be embodied in may forms and may be integrated into a single device or separated over many devices in communication with one another. Accordingly the illustrated embodiments are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.

Additionally the apparatus can include logic configured to establish a context for the pre programmed response and logic configured to determine available pre programmed responses base on the context see e.g. . Further embodiments can include logic configured to retrieve a pre recorded audio message e.g. from memory and logic configured to respond to the communication by playing the pre recorded audio message. For example the access terminal can use conventional hardware such as codecs and transceiver to transmit the audio response back to the caller as is known in the art. Audio input device can be used to record the audio message or it can be recorded and stored using any known method. For example the audio message can be recorded on a remote computer and uploaded to the access terminal via the RAN removable media e.g. SD RAM or stored directly on a server on the carrier network .

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any of the functions described herein can be embodied as various logic elements whether hardware software computer readable media or combinations of each in the apparatus. For example embodiments of the invention can include among other functions described herein apparatuses further having logic configured to display identification information for the communication and a list of pre programmed responses logic configured to associate the pre programmed response with the communication based on a selected pre programmed response from the list logic configured to logic configured to determine a category based on the identification information and to limit the list of pre programmed responses based on the category. Accordingly embodiments of the invention are not limited to the logical elements expressly discussed herein.
