This application is the national stage application of International Patent Application No. PCT FR2007 000221 filed Feb. 7 2007 which claims the benefit of French Patent Application No. FR 06 01058 filed Feb. 7 2006 the disclosures of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to the use of new antigens identified in the parasite in the context of the diagnosis and the prevention of trichinellosis.

Trichinellosis is a zoonosis associated with the consumption of meat infested with the parasite MURRELL et al. 2000 .

This nematode of the class Adenophorea belongs to the family Trichinellidae which comprises 8 species and 3 genotypes that are related in 2 phylogenetically distinct groups on the one hand the encapsulated trichinae which infest mammals end on the other hand the nonencapsulated trichinae which infest mammals birds and reptiles GASSER et al. 2004 . All these species can infest humans.

The biological cycle of the parasite is autoheteroxenous it takes place entirely in the same host which is successively the definitive host carrying adult parasites and the intermediate host carrying infesting larvae BOIREAU et al. 2002 . The passing of the infesting larvae from host to another is necessary in order for a new cycle to be carried out. This passage occurs through the ingestion of raw or barely cooked meat contaminated with the larvae. During digestion the latter are released and penetrate the intestinal epithelium where they will mature into sexual adult Ad worms. The fertilized females subsequently expel newborn L1 larvae L1NN which reach the striated muscles via the lymphatic circulation and the blood stream. These L1NN larvae penetrate the muscle cells infesting development stage L1M L1 muscle larva of which they bring about the dedifferentiation into feeder cells surrounded by a protective collagen capsule which is thick in the case of encapsulated trichinae very thin in the case of nonencapsulated trichinae.

Although trichinellosis is asymptomatic in animals human infestation is reflected during the initial intestinal phase by diarrhea associated with nausea vomiting and violent abdominal pain while the symptoms associated with the muscle invasion phase are characterized by the combination of fever facial edema and myalgia CAPO DESPOMMIER 1996 . Ocular pulmonary gastrointestinal cardiac and neurological attacks can also add to this clinical picture of trichinellosis the progression of which can be lethal. The chronic nature of the infestation marked by persistent muscle pain in patients is associated with the survival of the parasite in the feeder cell.

The specific treatment of human trichinellosis with anthelminthics is all the more effective if the diagnosis of the infestation is made early so as to allow action against all the parasitic stages and especially before the formation of the protective collagen capsule around the L1M larvae FOURESTIE et al. 1988 .

The epidemiological data have demonstrated a geographical distribution of the parasite in all parts of the world associated with a method of transmission involving many species of the wild type fauna which also maintain a domestic infestation cycle mainly represented by the pigs DUPOUY CAMET 2000 .

Epidemics of human trichinellosis an emerging or reemerging zoonosis constitute a real public health problem throughout the world owing to dietary habits and hygiene controls that are not always effective MURRELL POZIO 2000 . These epidemics essentially involve pig and wild boar meat and also horse meat BOIREAU et al. 2000 .

The prevention of human contamination therefore involves cooking meat right through and improving rearing conditions and or conditions for controlling animal trichinellosis pigs horses wild boar and other wild animal species sensitive to BOIREAU et al. 2002 .

The screening techniques for trichinellosis can be divided into two categories 1 direct detection of the L1M larvae by trichinoscopy microscopic observation of a meat fragment or after artificial digestion of muscle samples and 2 indirect detection by various immunological methods for detecting antibodies directed against the antigens.

Each of the developmental stages of the parasite adult Ad newborn larva L1NN and muscle larva L1M has a corresponding specific antigen profile.

It is antigen preparations derived from L1M stage larvae which are currently used for immunodiagnosis. This is because the antigen fractions of the two early stages Ad and L1NN are difficult to purify and it had not been possible to identify immunodominant antigens associated with one and or the other of these two stages up until now.

Either preparations of total soluble antigen obtained by lysis of the larvae centrifugation of the lysate and recovery of the supernatant or more commonly excretion secretion antigens E S antigens are principally used.

The excretion secretion antigens are produced when L1M larvae are placed under survival conditions in a culture medium they originate from a particular organ called the stichosome which comprises about fifty discoid cells the stichocytes. The stichocytes contain granules the content of which is evacuated by a canaliculus into the lumen of the parasite s esophagus. This content which is very highly antigenic constitutes a part of the excretion secretion antigens. These antigens form a complex mixture of proteins containing in particular a group of glycoproteins called TSL1 antigens bearing a specific carbohydrate molecule known only in and present in all the species of this parasite beta tyvelose.

The preparations of excretion secretion antigens which are currently used as a reference in terms of immunodiagnosis of trichinellosis are obtained from culture medium of L1M larvae. After culture for 18 to 20 hours the medium is recovered by filtration and then concentrated GAMBLE et al. 1983 GAMBLE et al. 1988 .

The principal drawback of the preparations of total soluble antigen is their lack of specificity. Antigen cross reactions with other parasitoses are commonly observed. The excretion secretion antigens make it possible to obtain a better specificity. However in both cases it is difficult to produce standardized batches of antigen in large amounts.

The saccharide structure containing beta tyvelose which represents an immunodominant epitope of E S antigen preparations REASON et al. 1994 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 541 075 and 5 707 817 has been synthesized chemically and its use for the immunodiagnosis of has been proposed.

This reagent has good specificity but its sensitivity appears to be lower than that of E S antigen preparations. In addition the chemical synthesis of this structure remains expensive and laborious to carry out.

Another problem encountered in the context of the serological diagnosis of is the existence of a blind window of detection corresponding to the early stages of infestation which is reflected by false negative results. In addition in horses gradual disappearance of the antibodies has been observed 25 weeks after infestation.

The inventors have undertaken to identify immunodominant antigens associated with the early stages of infestation and which can be used for the serological diagnosis of trichinellosis in order to provide means for obtaining early specific and sensitive detection of infestations both in humans and in animals. With this aim they have investigated whether there existed among the products of the genes expressed by at the L1NN stage and or at the Ad stage proteins which would possess the desired antigenic properties.

In this context they have discovered that a protein which is part of the proteins expressed specifically at the L1NN stage in this organism constitutes an immunodominant antigen allowing early detection of the humoral response directed against and that it is also conserved between various species of

This protein will hereinafter be referred to as NBL1. The complete cDNA sequence encoding this protein and also the polypeptide sequence which is deduced therefrom are respectively accessible on Genbank under numbers AF331160 and AAK16520 also known as Swissprot Q9BJL7 these sequences are annotated as serine protease SS2 specific for newborn larvae . These sequences are also respectively reproduced in the attached sequence listing under numbers SEQ ID NO 1 and SEQ ID NO 2. A partial cDNA sequence encoding this protein and also the polypeptide sequence which is deduced therefrom are respectively accessible on Genbank under numbers AY491941 and AAR36900 also known as Swissprot Q6RUJ3 .

The inventors have also shown that the immunoreactivity associated with the humoral response directed against NBL1 is located in the C terminal part of this protein and have identified an immunodominant epitope responsible for this reactivity.

Furthermore the inventors have identified using a cDNA library of mixed early Ad L1NN stages of a new gene hereinafter referred to as 411.

The sequence of this gene is represented in the attached sequence listing under the number SEQ ID NO 3 and that of its translation product under the number SEQ ID NO 4. This product of translation of this gene is related 78.7 identity to an E S antigen known as Tp21 3 protein identified in AAF79206 NAGANO et al. 2001 and also to the product of translation of the hypothetical ORF 17.20 of AAB48489 with which it exhibits 86.6 identity.

The 411 gene translation product also makes it possible to detect at an early stage the humoral response directed against various species of

In addition each of the NBL1 and 411 antigens has made it possible in the assays carried out to detect animals infested with which were not detected with the other antigen nor with the E S antigen at least during the period D15 D30 post infestation pi .

The combination of the NBL1 antigen or of an immunodominant epitope thereof with the 411 antigen therefore makes it possible to improve the sensitivity of the diagnosis in particular at the early stages of infestation 15 to 20 days after infestation .

Consequently a subject of the present invention is the use of an antigenic polypeptide recognized by anti antibodies as a reagent for detecting anti antibodies in a biological sample characterized in that said polypeptide is chosen from 

a a polypeptide comprising an immunodominant epitope of the NBL1 antigen which epitope is defined by the sequence PSSGSRPTYP SEQ ID NO 5 

b a polypeptide also referred to hereinafter as 411 antigen comprising amino acids 25 175 of the sequence SEQ ID NO 4 which represent the mature form of the 411 protein or comprising a sequence having at least 80 and by order of increasing preference at least 85 90 or 95 identity with the sequence of amino acids 25 175 of the sequence SEQ ID NO 4.

The present invention will be understood more clearly with the aid of the further description which follows which refers to examples illustrating the use of the NBL1 and 411 antigens for the early immunodiagnosis of trichinellosis.

Immunoscreening of a L1NN cDNA library was carried out with a pig serum obtained 35 days after experimental infestation with 10 000 L1M. The sequencing of the clones recognized by this serum made it possible to determine that most of them encoded the same protein.

This protein is a putative serine protease the cDNA sequence of which and the deduced amino acid sequence of which are respectively available on Genbank under numbers AF331160 and AAK16520 and are also reproduced here under the numbers SEQ ID NO 1 and SEQ ID NO 2. It is referred to herein as NBL1.

A portion of the C terminal part of the protein was amplified using the oligonucleotides NBL1CtermF 5 CACCGAAAATTCTCCTGAAGGA 3 SEQ ID NO 12 and NBL1CtermR 5 TGTTGTTGTAGTAACTCC 3 SEQ ID NO 13 and the AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase Invitrogen and was cloned into the plasmid pET102D topo using the Champion pET102 Directional TOPO expression kit according to the manufacturer s recommendations Invitrogen .

The recombinant plasmid obtained called pET102 NBL1 Cterm encodes a thioredoxin NBL1 Cterm fusion protein THX NBL1 Cterm of 291 AA carrying a polyhistidine tag at the C terminal position. The sequence of this fusion protein is represented in .

The THX NBL1 Cterm fusion protein was expressed in BL21 Star DE3 BL21 DE3 pLys bacteria Invitrogen transformed with the plasmid pET102 NBL1 Cterm and purified by affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions on an Ni NTA column Ni NTA spin columns kit Ni NTA beads using the protocol recommended by the supplier Qiagen .

The purified THX NBL1 Cterm fusion protein appears after electrophoresis under denaturing conditions SDS PAGE in the form of a band at the expected size of 31.1 kDa.

The immunoreactivity of the THX NBL1 Cterm protein with respect to a serum from a pig free of trichinellosis and from a serum of a pig infested with 20 000 L1M larvae taken 60 days after infestation was analyzed by Western blotting.

After electrophoresis under denaturing conditions SDS PAGE the protein was electro blotted onto a Hybond P PVDF membrane according to the supplier s instructions Amersham . The membranes were prehybridized for 1 h in TBS T 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 0.1 Tween 20 and 5 of skimmed milk. After 2 washes in TBS T for 1 min then 3 washes in TBS T for 5 min the membranes were incubated for 1 h with the pig serum diluted to 1 200 in TBS. After washing the membranes were incubated for 20 min with the rabbit anti pig IgG secondary antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase A1192 Sigma diluted to 1 30 000 and then with the pure NBT BCIP substrate E116 Interchim for 30 min in order to reveal the labeling.

A very strong immunoreactivity of THX NBL1 Cterm is observed with the serum from the pig infested with

The THX NBL1 Cterm protein prepared as described in example 1 above was evaluated by indirect ELISA with respect to sera derived from pigs infested with in comparison with the excretion secretion E S antigen.

The reference E S antigen is prepared according to the protocol described by GAMBLE et al. 1988 . It is obtained from the culture supernatant of L1M larvae maintained under survival conditions for 24 h in RPMI 1640 containing 1 of pyruvate 15 of fetal calf serum FCS 1 of L glutamine 100 U ml of penicillin and 100 g ml of streptomycin.

For the ELISA assays the antigen diluted in 1 PBS buffer at a rate of 1.25 g ml for the E S antigen and of 2 g ml for THX NBL1 Cterm is incubated overnight at 4 C. on 96 well plates MediSorp plates NUNC . After washes 1 PBS Tween 20 at 0.05 the plates are saturated at ambient temperature for 1 H with a solution of skimmed milk diluted to 2 in the washing solution.

100 l of pig serum diluted to 1 20 in 1 PBS buffer supplemented with Tween 20 at 0.05 are deposited into each well. After incubation for 30 minutes at 37 C. followed by 3 washes 1 PBS Tween 20 at 0.05 100 l of the solution of conjugate protein G peroxidase P 8170 Sigma diluted to 1 32 000 in 1 PBS buffer supplemented with Tween 20 at 0.05 are deposited into each well. After further incubation for 30 min at 37 C. followed by 3 washes 1 PBS Tween 20 at 0.05 100 l of a solution of substrate 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine hydrogen peroxide TMB3 are deposited into each well. After incubation for 20 min at ambient temperature in the dark the reaction is stopped by adding 100 l well of 0.5 M HSO. The plates are read by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm.

The result of the ELISA plate readings is provided in the form of the percentage reactivity of a sample serum relative to a positive control serum.

The positivity threshold equal to twice the mean value of the reference negative samples is 14 for the E S Ag ELISA and 44 for the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA.

The kinetics of appearance of the anti antibodies detected by THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA or by E S Ag ELISA in sera from conventional pigs experimentally infested with 200 1000 or 20 000 L1M larvae were compared.

The THX NBL1 Cterm antigen allows the dose dependent detection of humoral responses directed against . The detection of conformational epitopes by means of this ELISA assay combined with the detection of linear epitopes by means of Western blotting demonstrate moreover the immunodominant nature of the NBL1 protein.

The THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA detects the seroconversion from the 25th day pi onward whereas the E S Ag ELISA detects the seroconversion only 10 days later.

The detection by E S Ag ELISA and THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA of the humoral responses induced by and the other three species of identified in Europe and was also compared.

All these results show that the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA allows a particularly early detection of the humoral responses from the 15th day pi onward for the highly infested animals and a slightly delayed detection for the animals infested with a medium load of 1000 L1M 25th day pi . Similar results were obtained with holoxenic pigs infested according to the same protocol. The earliest seroconversion detected by the E S Ag ELISA was at the 25th day pi. The comparison of the results obtained with the 2 ELISA assays demonstrated a gain of 5 to 20 days in terms of early detection for the diagnosis of by using the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA table I . Furthermore the animals infested with which were diagnosed both by the E S Ag ELISA and the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA all saw their window of serological detection reduced with the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA. The sensitivity of the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA was demonstrated with the effect of screening of 7 9 conventional pigs during this animal experiment i.e. 3 3 pigs infested with 20 000 L1M 3 3 pigs infested with 1000 L1M and 1 3 pigs infested with only 200 L1M of . The detections were associated with the muscle parasite load in these animals which varied on average from 3 larvae per gram LpG for the pigs experimentally infested with 200 L1M to 43 LpG for the pigs experimentally infested with 1000 L1M and 538 LpG for the pigs experimentally infested with 20 000 L1M.

The humoral responses induced by the other three species of identified in Europe and were themselves also detected in a dose dependent manner by the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA demonstrating the genetic and antigenic conservation of NBL1 in the genus immunodominance and consequently the great advantage thereof for the broad spectrum diagnosis of trichinelloses. The sensitivity and the earliness of the diagnosis 15th day pi were confirmed. The seroconversion window was reduced by 5 to 45 days with the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA and like the infestation with all the animals which were diagnosed both by E S Ag ELISA and THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA saw their serological detection window reduced with the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA. Furthermore the analysis of the infestation with the species demonstrates the high sensitivity of the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA which diagnosed 6 9 animals against 5 9 animals with the E S Ag ELISA including 2 pigs not revealed by screening with the E S Ag ELISA whereas the muscle parasite load was on average only 7 10 at 0.1 LpG only.

The specificity of the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA was demonstrated by means of the sera taken from all the animals before each experimental infestation and up to 10 days pi. More than 200 sera from free range pigs were used to show the specificity of the molecule. No pig negative with respect to reacts with the THX NBL1 Cterm ELISA.

An analysis in silico of the deduced amino acid sequence of the C terminal part of NBL1 was carried out in order to predict the most antigenic regions.

The results of the analysis in silico resulted in the selection of 11 overlapping peptides covering 113 Am of the c terminal part of NBL1 from AA 327 to AA 440 . The sequences of these peptides are indicated hereinafter

The antigenicity of the N5EM peptides with respect to a serum from a pig infested with 20 000 L1M larvae collected 60 days after the infestation was evaluated by indirect ELISA using a protocol identical to that described in example 2 with the exception that the peptides biotinylated beforehand are incubated 2 g ml in 1 PBS 100 l well on plates pretreated with streptavidin.

Three immunoreactive peptides NSEM5 7 and 11 were detected. The analysis of the primary sequence of the immunoreactive peptides revealed the presence of a common motif of 10 amino acids PSSGSRPTYP SEQ ID NO 5 . This motif is moreover present 4 times over the entire sequence of the NBL1 protein. Furthermore the mapping of epitopes via overlapping peptides of 6AA made it possible to demonstrate the essential importance of a single AA a tyrosine for the immunoreactivity of the linear epitope within the peptides.

Additional experiments finally demonstrated that N5EM11 was the most reactive peptide compared to N5EM5 and N5EM7 in terms of sensitivity and earliness.

These results show that the N5EM11 ELISA makes it possible to detect moderate infestations. Furthermore early detection from the 20th day after infection onward was obtained i.e. 5 to 10 days earlier than what was possible with the E S Ag ELISA.

A decrease in the anti N5EM11 antibody titer after the detection peak was also observed which confirms this early nature and which is of use for dating a recent infestation. All the pigs infested with and diagnosed using the N5EM11 peptide ELISA show a seroconversion window which is in part similar but in the majority of cases smaller than that observed with the E S Ag ELISA.

Moreover N5EM11 exhibits antigen cross reactions with the serum from pigs infested with and demonstrating the immunodominance of this peptide at the L1NN stage of . These antigen cross reactions result in detection that can be obtained 5 to 30 days earlier than with the E S Ag ELISA.

A decrease in sensitivity was nevertheless noted in comparison with the E S Ag ELISA in terms of delayed detection for animals infected with and codetected using the two assays. In contrast the N5EM11 ELISA also made it possible to diagnose an animal infested with and not detected by screening with the E S Ag ELISA although the muscle parasite load was residual.

The specificity of the N5EM11 ELISA was evaluated using sera taken from 300 animals before experimental infestation and up to 10 days pi. This specificity is greater than 99 results not shown .

The nucleic sequence of this cDNA clone and also the deduced polypeptide sequence were determined and are respectively represented in the sequence listing under the numbers SEQ ID NO 3 and SEQ ID NO 4. The open reading frame of 411 encodes a putative protein of 20 kDa. With the exception of a signal peptide no protein domain was identified.

Comparison of the complete open reading frame of 411 with the sequences available on Genbank shows that it has 78.7 identity with the Tp21 3 excretion secretion protein identified in AAF79206 NAGANO et al. 2001 and 86.6 identity with the hypothetical ORF 17.20 sequence of submitted by Polvere and Despommier AAB48489 . These sequence comparisons identify 411 as a new member of this gene family common to the genus.

The complete open reading frame of 411 was amplified using the oligonucleotides 411F 5 CACCCGAGAAAACATGCAT 3 SEQ ID NO 22 and 411R 5 TCCATTCAATTTTGCGTCAC 3 SEQ ID NO 23 and the AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase Invitrogen and was cloned into the plasmid pET102D topo using the Champion pET102 Directional TOPO expression kit according to the manufacturer s recommendations Invitrogen .

The recombinant plasmid obtained for pET102 411 encodes a thioredoxin 411 fusion protein THX 411 of 330 AA for a predicted molecular mass of 36.7 kDa and carrying a polyhistidine tag at the C terminal position. The sequence of this fusion protein is given in .

The THX 411 fusion protein was expressed in BL21 Star DE3 BL21 DE3 pLys bacteria Invitrogen transformed by the plasmid pET102 411 and purified by affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions on an Ni NTA column Ni NTA spin columns kit Ni NTA beads using the protocol recommended by the supplier Qiagen .

The purified THX 411 fusion protein appears after electrophoresis under denaturing conditions SDS PAGE in the form of a band at the expected size of 36.7 kDa.

The immunoreactivity of the THX 411 protein with respect to a serum from a pig free of trichinellosis and to the serum from the same pig 30 days and 50 days after infestation with 20 000 L1M larvae was compared with that of the E S reference antigen prepared as described in example 2 above . The analysis was carried out by Western blotting using the same protocol as that described in example 1 above.

Very strong immunoreactivity of THX 411 with the sera from the pig infested with and the early detection of anti 411 antibodies 30 days pi were observed. A slight background noise was observed due to the cross reactions between the residual high molecular weight bacterial proteins remaining in the THX 411 preparation and the anti antibodies present in the sera.

The protein prepared as described in example 4 above was evaluated by indirect ELISA with respect to sera derived from pigs infested with in comparison with the excretion secretion E S antigen of

The kinetics of appearance of the anti antibodies detected by THX 411 ELISA or by E S Ag ELISA in sera from conventional pigs experimentally infested with 200 1000 or 20 000 L1M larvae were compared. The detection by E S Ag ELISA and THX 411 ELISA of the humoral responses induced by and the other three species of identified in Europe and was also compared.

The protocol used is identical to that described in example 2. The THX 411 antigen was used at 2 g ml and the E S antigen at 1.25 g ml.

All these results show that the 411 antigen allows the dose dependent detection of the humoral responses directed against . The detection of conformational epitopes using this ELISA assay combined with the detection of linear epitopes with Western blotting demonstrate moreover the immunodominant nature of the 411 protein.

The recombinant THX 411 protein allows a particularly early detection of antibodies directed against from the 20th day pi onward for the animals highly infested with 20 000 L1M . The seroconversion is accompanied by a profile of humoral responses having high titers and maintained for up to 60 days pi. The seroconversion of the animals infested with a moderate and low load of the parasite was detected later at the 30th day pi and 60th day pi respectively. The earliest seroconversion detected by the E S Ag ELISA is at the 25th day pi.

Two out of five of the infested animals which were diagnosed with both the E S Ag ELISA and the THX 411 ELISA saw their window of serological detection get smaller with the THX 411 ELISA with a gain of 5 to 10 days in terms of earliness. The sensitivity of the THX 411 ELISA was demonstrated with the effective screening of 5 9 conventional pigs during this animal experiment i.e. 3 3 pigs infested with 20 000 L1M 1 3 pigs infested with 1000 L1M and 1 3 pigs infested with only 200 L1M of . The detections were associated with the muscle parasite load in these animals which varied on average from 3 larvae per gram LpG for the pigs experimentally infested with 200 L1M to 43 LpG for the pigs infested with 1000 L1M and 538 LpG for the pigs infested with 20 000 L1M.

The humoral responses induced by and were themselves also detected with the THX 411 ELISA 10 12 animals infested with 20 000 L1M demonstrating the genetic and antigenic conservation of 411 in the genus and consequently its absolute advantage for the broad spectrum diagnosis of trichinelloses. The earliness of the diagnosis was confirmed from the 20th day pi onward. The seroconversion window was reduced by 5 to 20 days with the 411 ELISA and like the infestation with the 50 to 100 of the animals which were diagnosed with both the E S Ag ELISA and the THX 411 ELISA saw their serological detection window get smaller with the THX 411 ELISA. The analysis of the infestation with the species demonstrated an increased sensitivity of the THX 411 ELISA which diagnosed 6 9 animals against 5 9 animals with the E S Ag ELISA although the muscle parasite load was on average only 7 10 at 0.1 LpG only. Furthermore similar humoral response profiles were obtained for the animals infested with and although the intensity of the infestation generated by the latter species was significantly lower suggesting that the 511 protein of is very highly immunogenic in nature and could be used for the detection of this species resistant to freezing.

The specificity of the THX 411 ELISA was evaluated using sera taken from 150 animals before experimental infestation and up to 10 days pi. This specificity is greater than 99 results not shown .

The NBL1 and 411 antigens constitute immunodominant antigens which are conserved within the genus. The ELISA assays using these antigens NBL1 C terminal part N5EM11 peptide epitope of NBL1 411 antigen have a greater than 99 specificity with respect to and allow the early diagnosis 15 60 days after infestation of porcine trichinelloses produced by the four species of identified in Europe.

The ELISA assay using the purified recombinant THX NBL1 Cterm protein containing the immunodominant epitope of NBL1 located in the C terminal part of the protein is specific and sensitive and allows the diagnosis of porcine trichinelloses from 5 to 45 days earlier than with the E S Ag ELISA. Furthermore this assay made it possible to obtain a reduced serological detection window compared with the E S Ag ELISA in 100 of the animals which were diagnosed both with the E S Ag ELISA and with the THX NBL1 Cterm 

The ELISA assay using the purified recombinant THX 411 protein reproduces the kinetics of the humoral responses detected with the E S Ag ELISA with a sensitivity that is currently slightly lower 17 36 animals diagnosed . However the sensitivity of this new ELISA made it possible to diagnose one pig not diagnosed by screening with the E S Ag ELISA. The THX 411 ELISA can make it possible to diagnose porcine trichinelloses from 5 to 20 days earlier than with the E S Ag ELISA. Furthermore 50 to 100 of the animals which were diagnosed both with the E S Ag ELISA and the THX 411 ELISA saw their serological detection window get smaller with the THX 411 ELISA.

All these results show that the NBL1 and 411 antigens can be used as an alternative to the E S antigen or as a supplement thereto for the early serological diagnosis of trichinelloses. In addition the combination of these two new antigens makes it possible to enhance the sensitivity of the ELISA by virtue of the diagnosis of an additional animal.

The combination of NBL1 Cterm with immunodominant peptide of N5EM11 type and 411 makes it possible to enhance the sensitivity of diagnosis 24 36 animals detected .

The additive effect of NBL1 with 411 is reflected by the gain in detection of one animal induced with 411 and also by the earlier detection of one animal induced with 411. The triple combination NBL1 411 N5EM11 stabilizes the ELISA assay over time through the simultaneous codetection of antibodies by 2 or 3 antigens without however any additional gain in terms of number of animals.
