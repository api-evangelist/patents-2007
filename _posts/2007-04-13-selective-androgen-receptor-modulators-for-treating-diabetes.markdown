This invention was made in whole or in part with government support under grant number R29 CA068096 awarded by the National Cancer Institute National Institute of Health and under grant number R15 HD35329 awarded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development National Institute of Health. The government may have certain rights in the invention.

This invention provides SARM compounds and uses thereof in treating a variety of diseases or conditions in a subject including inter alia diabetes and associated diseases such as for example chronic kidney disease nephropathy neuropathy and retinopathy diabetes insulin resistance cachexia cardiovascular disease and associated conditions such as atherosclerosis cerebrovascular disease and others.

Obesity and its associated disorders represent major health problems in all industrialized countries. Obesity defined as an excess of body fat relative to lean body mass has been directly linked to increased incidences of diseases such as coronary artery disease stroke and diabetes and is one of the factors whose presence defines Syndrome X .

At the center of Syndrome X and Metabolic Syndrome is the common feature of tissue resistance to the action of insulin. This impaired biological response to insulin is manifested in the metabolic and vascular effects of insulin. The most common presentation of Syndrome X is associated with obesity.

The adaptive response to insulin resistance IR in individuals produces compensatory hyperinsulinaemia. As subjects progressively insulin resistant they manifest varying degrees of change in clinical parameters including blood pressure and or increased levels of serum glucose and or cholesterol and or triglycerides and or uric acid and or factors that increase coagulation. Once these clinical parameters have changed enough the patient may differentially manifest well recognized clinical conditions including type 2 diabetes hypertension high blood pressure hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia particularly but not limited to hypertriglyceridemia hyperuricemia or gout and hypercoagulability defined as an abnormal increased tendency for clots to form particularly inside blood vessels . These clinical conditions are well recognized risk factors for cardiovascular coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease.

The treatment of factors contributing to IR e.g. obesity or the treatment of IR itself improves many of the clinical conditions which at first glance appear to be unrelated. For example dieting alone or pharmacotherapeutic agents that induce weight loss will decrease blood pressure blood glucose and triglycerides. Agents that are designed to improve insulin sensitivity can also favorably alter blood pressure lipids and blood glucose.

Diabetes mellitus is characterized by metabolic defects in production and utilization of carbohydrates resulting in elevated blood glucose or hyperglycemia due to the failure to maintain appropriate blood sugar levels. Research in the treatment of diabetes has centered on attempts to normalize fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels. Current treatments include administration of exogenous insulin oral administration of drugs and dietary therapies and exercise regimens.

Two major forms of diabetes mellitus are recognized. Type 1 diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin the hormone which regulates carbohydrate utilization. Type 2 diabetes or non insulin dependent diabetes often occurs with normal or even elevated levels of insulin and appears to be the result of the inability of tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Complications of type 2 diabetes include retinopathy nephropathy neuropathy and coronary heart disease and are believed to be triggered by excessive protein glycation which in turn results from excessive levels of circulating glucose.

New innovative approaches are urgently needed at both the basic science and clinical levels to develop compounds which are useful for treating suppressing inhibiting or reducing the incidence of a Diabetes b glucose intolerance c hyperinsulinemia d insulin resistance e dyslipidemia f cachexia g hypercholesterolemia h high blood pressure i cardiovascular disease or disorder j atherosclerosis k stroke l cerebrovascular conditions and diseases disorders or conditions related thereto.

In one embodiment the compositions of this invention may include a SARM of this invention or any combination thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.

Suitable excipients and carriers may be according to embodiments of the invention solid or liquid and the type is generally chosen based on the type of administration being used. Liposomes may also be used to deliver the composition. Examples of suitable solid carriers include lactose sucrose gelatin and agar. Oral dosage forms may contain suitable binders lubricants diluents disintegrating agents coloring agents flavoring agents flow inducing agents and melting agents. Liquid dosage forms may contain for example suitable solvents preservatives emulsifying agents suspending agents diluents sweeteners thickeners and melting agents. Parenteral and intravenous forms should also include minerals and other materials to make them compatible with the type of injection or delivery system chosen. Of course other excipients may also be used.

For liquid formulations pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be aqueous or non aqueous solutions suspensions emulsions or oils. Examples of non aqueous solvents are propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water alcoholic aqueous solutions cyclodextrins emulsions or suspensions including saline and buffered media.

Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots e.g. fatty acids waxes oils . In another embodiment the composition is an immediate release composition i.e. a composition in which all of the SARM compound is released immediately after administration.

In another embodiment the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. For example the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion an implantable osmotic pump a transdermal patch liposomes or other modes of administration. In one embodiment a pump may be used see Langer supra Sefton CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14 201 1987 Buchwald et al. Surgery 88 507 1980 Saudek et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 321 574 1989 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in proximity to the therapeutic target i.e. the brain thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson in Medical Applications of Controlled Release supra vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 . Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer Science 249 1527 1533 1990 .

The compositions may also include incorporation of the active material into or onto particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid polglycolic acid hydrogels etc or onto liposomes microemulsions micelles unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles erythrocyte ghosts or spheroplasts. Such compositions will influence the physical state solubility stability rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance.

Also comprehended by the invention are particulate compositions coated with polymers e.g. poloxamers or poloxamines and the compound coupled to antibodies directed against tissue specific receptors ligands or antigens or coupled to ligands of tissue specific receptors.

Also comprehended by the invention are compounds modified by the covalent attachment of water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol carboxymethyl cellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyproline. The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds Abuchowski et al. 1981 Newmark et al. 1982 and Katre et al. 1987 . Such modifications may also increase the compound s solubility in aqueous solution eliminate aggregation enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result the desired in vivo biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.

The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which contain an active component is well understood in the art for example by mixing granulating or tablet forming processes. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. For oral administration the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts esters N oxides and the like are mixed with additives customary for this purpose such as vehicles stabilizers or inert diluents and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration such as tablets coated tablets hard or soft gelatin capsules aqueous alcoholic or oily solutions. For parenteral administration the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts esters N oxides and the like are converted into a solution suspension or emulsion if desired with the substances customary and suitable for this purpose for example solubilizers or other.

An active component can be formulated into the composition as neutralized pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide or antibody molecule which are formed with inorganic acids such as for example hydrochloric or phosphoric acids or such organic acids as acetic oxalic tartaric mandelic and the like. Salts formed from the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as for example sodium potassium ammonium calcium or ferric hydroxides and such organic bases as isopropylamine trimethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine and the like.

For use in medicine the salts of the compounds of formula I XX will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may however be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may for example be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid sulphuric acid methanesulphonic acid fumaric acid maleic acid succinic acid acetic acid benzoic acid oxalic acid citric acid tartaric acid carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.

A muscle is a tissue of the body that primarily functions as a source of power. There are three types of muscles in the body a skeletal muscle the muscle responsible for moving extremities and external areas of the bodies b cardiac muscle the heart muscle and c smooth muscle the muscle that is in the walls of arteries and bowel.

A wasting condition or disorder is defined herein as a condition or disorder that is characterized at least in part by an abnormal progressive loss of body organ or tissue mass. A wasting condition can occur as a result of a pathology such as for example cancer or an infection or it can be due to a physiologic or metabolic state such as disuse deconditioning that can occur for example due to prolonged bed rest or when a limb is immobilized such as in a cast. A wasting condition can also be age associated. The loss of body mass that occurs during a wasting condition can be characterized by a loss of total body weight or a loss of organ weight such as a loss of bone or muscle mass due to a decrease in tissue protein.

In one embodiment muscle wasting or muscular wasting used herein interchangeably refer to the progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement cardiac muscles which control the heart and smooth muscles. In one embodiment the muscle wasting condition or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. Chronic muscle wasting is defined herein as the chronic i.e. persisting over a long period of time progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the chronic progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle.

The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation an unusually low rate of protein synthesis or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term catabolism has its commonly known meaning in the art specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.

Muscle wasting can occur as a result of a pathology disease condition or disorder. In one embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is chronic. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is genetic. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is neurological. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is infectious. As described herein the pathologies diseases conditions or disorders for which the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered are those that directly or indirectly produce a wasting i.e. loss of muscle mass that is a muscle wasting disorder.

In one embodiment muscle wasting in a subject is a result of the subject having a muscular dystrophie muscle atrophy X linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA .

In some embodiments muscle loss or muscle wasting or cachexia in a subject results in reduced protein reserves decreased strength and functional capacity frailty falls reduced aerobic capacity reduced energy requirements or increased mortality in patients and the methods of this invention serve to treat these conditions as well in the subject via the administration of any embodiment of a SARM and or composition as described herein.

In some embodiments muscle loss or muscle wasting or cachexia in a subject results in increased dietary protein needs inflammation accelerated muscle protein breakdown loss of motor units aging CNS reduced rate of muscle protein synthesis post prandial and or changing endocrine function testosterone estrogen growth hormone insulin resistance and the methods of this invention serve to treat these conditions as well in the subject via the administration of any embodiment of a SARM and or composition as described herein.

In some embodiments this invention provides methods for the treating of sarcopenia and or cachexia via the administration of any embodiment of a compound and or composition as described herein.

In some embodiments treatment with a compound and or composition as described herein may provide for the increased rate of muscle protein synthesis increased muscle size and strength improved functional status in elderly people increased independence for older frail people increased insulin sensitivity which in some embodiments is whereby such administration results in the treatment of cachexia and or sarcopenia or other disorders as described herein. Muscle is the primary site for glucose metabolism insulin resistance is largely a problem of resistance of muscle to insulin resulting from increased lipid in muscle cells increased total fat increased visceral fat with the compounds and or compositions of this invention being useful to reduce total fat thereby increasing insulin sensitivity and or reducing the risk of or treating etc. diabetes as described herein.

The muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal or voluntary muscles that control movement. The muscles of the heart and some other involuntary muscles are also affected in some forms of muscular dystrophy. The major forms of muscular dystrophy MD are duchenne muscular dystrophy myotonic dystrophy duchenne muscular dystrophy becker muscular dystrophy limb girdle muscular dystrophy facioscapulhumeral muscular dystrophy congenital muscular dystrophy oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy distal muscular dystrophy and emery dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Muscular dystrophy can affect people of all ages. Although some forms first become apparent in infancy or childhood others may not appear until middle age or later. Duchenne MD is the most common form typically affecting children. Myotonic dystrophy is the most common of these diseases in adults.

Muscle atrophy MA is characterized by wasting away or diminution of muscle and a decrease in muscle mass. For example Post Polio MA is a muscle wasting that occurs as part of the post polio syndrome PPS . The atrophy includes weakness muscle fatigue and pain.

Another type of MA is X linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA also known as Kennedy s Disease . This disease arises from a defect in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome affects only males and its onset is in adulthood. Because the primary disease cause is an androgen receptor mutation androgen replacement is not a current therapeutic strategy. There are some investigational studies where exogenous testosterone propionate is being given to boost the levels of androgen with hopes of overcoming androgen insensitivity and perhaps provide an anabolic effect. Still use of supraphysiological levels of testosterone for supplementation will have limitations and other potentially serious complications.

Sarcopenia is a debilitating disease that afflicts the elderly and chronically ill patients and is characterized by loss of muscle mass and function. Further increased lean body mass is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality for certain muscle wasting disorders. In addition other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting disorders. For example studies have shown that in severe cases of chronic lower back pain there is paraspinal muscle wasting.

Muscle wasting and other tissue wasting is also associated with advanced age. It is believed that general weakness in old age is due to muscle wasting. As the body ages an increasing proportion of skeletal muscle is replaced by fibrous tissue. The result is a significant reduction in muscle power performance and endurance.

Long term hospitalization due to illness or injury or disuse deconditioning that occurs for example when a limb is immobilized can also lead to muscle wasting or wasting of other tissue. Studies have shown that in patients suffering injuries chronic illnesses burns trauma or cancer who are hospitalized for long periods of time there is a long lasting unilateral muscle wasting and a decrease in body mass.

Injuries or damage to the central nervous system CNS are also associated with muscle wasting and other wasting disorders. Injuries or damage to the CNS can be for example caused by diseases trauma or chemicals. Examples are central nerve injury or damage peripheral nerve injury or damage and spinal cord injury or damage. In one embodiment CNS damage or injury comprise Alzheimer s diseases AD anger mood anorexia anorexia nervosa anorexia associated with aging and or assertiveness mood .

In another embodiment muscle wasting or other tissue wasting may be a result of alcoholism and may be treated with the compounds and compositions of the invention representing embodiments thereof.

In some embodiments wasting is due to infection with enterovirus Epstein Barr virus herpes zoster HIV trypanosomes influenze coxsackie rickettsia trichinella schistosoma or mycobacteria and this invention in some embodiments provides methods of treatment thereof.

Cachexia is weakness and a loss of weight caused by a disease or as a side effect of illness. Cardiac cachexia i.e. a muscle protein wasting of both the cardiac and skeletal muscle is a characteristic of congestive heart failure. Cancer cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is manifested by weight loss with massive depletion of both adipose tissue and lean muscle mass.

Cachexia is also seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS human immunodeficiency virus HIV associated myopathy and or muscle weakness wasting is a relatively common clinical manifestation of AIDS. Individuals with HIV associated myopathy or muscle weakness or wasting typically experience significant weight loss generalized or proximal muscle weakness tenderness and muscle atrophy.

In some embodiments injuries or damage to the CNS may be associated with muscle wasting disorders. Injuries or damage to the CNS can be for example caused by diseases trauma or chemicals. Examples are central nerve injury or damage peripheral nerve injury or damage and spinal cord injury or damage.

Studies involving patients with spinal cord injuries SCI have shown that central neurotransmitters may be altered after SCI causing hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis dysfunction whose disruption led to a significant decrease in testosterone and other hormone levels. SCI or other acute illness or trauma characteristically includes heightened catabolism in conjunction with the lowered anabolic activity resulting in a condition that is prone to loss of lean body tissue which is often accompanied by disturbed nutrient utilization. The effects of the loss of lean body mass include the development of wounds and impaired healing mechanisms further compounding the problem. Because of poor nutrition and protein combined with immobilization patients with spinal cord injury are at high risk for bed sores.

In one embodiment a wide variety of injuries of the CNS may be treated by the methods of the present invention. CNS injury may refer in one embodiment to a breakdown of the membrane of a nerve cell or in another embodiment to the inability of the nerve to produce and propagate nerve impulses or in another embodiment to the death of the cell. An injury includes damage that directly or indirectly affects the normal functioning of the CNS. The injury may be a structural physical or mechanical impairment and may be caused by physical impact as in the case of a crushing compression or stretching of nerve fibers. Alternatively the cell membrane may be destroyed by or degraded by an illness a chemical imbalance or a physiological malfunction such as anoxia e.g. stroke aneurysm or reperfusion. A CNS injury includes for example and without limitation damage to retinal ganglion cells a traumatic brain injury a stroke related injury a cerebral aneurism related injury a spinal cord injury including monoplegia diplegia paraplegia hemiplegia and quadriplegia a neuroproliferative disorder or neuropathic pain syndrome.

With injury to the spinal cord of a mammal connections between nerves in the spinal cord are broken. Such injuries block the flow of nerve impulses for the nerve tracts affected by the injury with a resulting impairment to both sensory and motor function. Injuries to the spinal cord may arise from compression or other contusion of the spinal cord or a crushing or severing of the spinal cord. A severing of the spinal cord also referred to herein as a transection may be a complete severing or may be an incomplete severing of the spinal cord.

In some embodiments the methods of treating a subject suffering form a CNS injury or in other embodiments spinal cord injury may be accompanied by treatment of the subject with electrical stimulation of the injured site and the administration of a purine nucleoside or analog thereof for example as described in United States Patent Application Publication Number 20040214790A1.

In one embodiment the dermatological disorder is a wound or a burn. In some embodiments wounds and or ulcers are found protruding from the skin or on a mucosal surface or as a result of an infarction in an organ. A wound may be a result of a soft tissue defect or a lesion or of an underlying condition. In one embodiment the term wound denotes a bodily injury with disruption of the normal integrity of tissue structures. The term is also intended to encompass the terms sore lesion necrosis and ulcer . In one embodiment the term sore refers to any lesion of the skin or mucous membranes and the term ulcer refers to a local defect or excavation of the surface of an organ or tissue which is produced by the sloughing of necrotic tissue. Lesion generally relates to any tissue defect. Necrosis is related to dead tissue resulting from infection injury inflammation or infarctions. All of these are encompassed by the term wound which denotes any wound at any particular stage in the healing process including the stage before any healing has initiated or even before a specific wound like a surgical incision is made prophylactic treatment .

Examples of wounds which can be prevented and or treated in accordance with the present invention are e.g. aseptic wounds contused wounds incised wounds lacerated wounds non penetrating wounds i.e. wounds in which there is no disruption of the skin but there is injury to underlying structures open wounds penetrating wounds perforating wounds puncture wounds septic wounds subcutaneous wounds etc. Examples of sores are bed sores canker sores chrome sores cold sores pressure sores etc. Examples of ulcers are e.g. peptic ulcer duodenal ulcer gastric ulcer gouty ulcer diabetic ulcer hypertensive ischemic ulcer stasis ulcer ulcus cruris venous ulcer sublingual ulcer submucous ulcer symptomatic ulcer trophic ulcer tropical ulcer veneral ulcer e.g. caused by gonorrhoea including urethritis endocervicitis and proctitis . Conditions related to wounds or sores which may be successfully treated according to the invention are burns anthrax tetanus gas gangrene scalatina erysipelas sycosis barbae folliculitis impetigo contagiosa or impetigo bullosa etc. There is often a certain overlap between the use of the terms wound and ulcer and wound and sore and furthermore the terms are often used at random. Therefore as mentioned above in the present context the term wounds encompasses the term ulcer lesion sore and infarction and the terms are indiscriminately used unless otherwise indicated.

The kinds of wounds to be treated according to the invention include also i general wounds such as e.g. surgical traumatic infectious ischemic thermal chemical and bullous wounds ii wounds specific for the oral cavity such as e.g. post extraction wounds endodontic wounds especially in connection with treatment of cysts and abscesses ulcers and lesions of bacterial viral or autoimmunological origin mechanical chemical thermal infectious and lichenoid wounds herpes ulcers stomatitis aphthosa acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis and burning mouth syndrome are specific examples and iii wounds on the skin such as e.g. neoplasm burns e.g. chemical thermal lesions bacterial viral autoimmunological bites and surgical incisions. Another way of classifying wounds is as i small tissue loss due to surgical incisions minor abrasions and minor bites or as ii significant tissue loss. The latter group includes ischemic ulcers pressure sores fistulae lacerations severe bites thermal burns and donor site wounds in soft and hard tissues and infarctions.

In other aspects of the invention the wound to be prevented and or treated is selected from the group consisting of aseptic wounds infarctions contused wounds incised wounds lacerated wounds non penetrating wounds open wounds penetrating wounds perforating wounds puncture wounds septic wounds and subcutaneous wounds.

Other wounds which are of importance in connection with the present invention are wounds like ischemic ulcers pressure sores fistulae severe bites thermal burns and donor site wounds.

In another embodiment the compositions as described herein are useful in chronic catabolic state coma wasting conditions starvation eating disorders concomitant bone fracture and muscle damage critical illness in which muscle or bone wasting are apparent and or connective tissue diseases and disorders

Ischemic ulcers and pressure sores are wounds which normally only heal very slowly and especially in such cases an improved and more rapid healing is of course of great importance for the patient. Furthermore the costs involved in the treatment of patients suffering from such wounds are markedly reduced when the healing is improved and takes place more rapidly.

Donor site wounds are wounds which e.g. occur in connection with removal of hard tissue from one part of the body to another part of the body e.g. in connection with transplantation. The wounds resulting from such operations are very painful and an improved healing is therefore most valuable.

The term skin is used in a very broad sense embracing the epidermal layer of the skin and in those cases where the skin surface is more or less injured also the dermal layer of the skin. Apart from the stratum comeum the epidermal layer of the skin is the outer epithelial layer and the deeper connective tissue layer of the skin is called the dermis.

A wasting condition or disorder is defined herein as a condition or disorder that is characterized at least in part by an abnormal progressive loss of body organ or tissue mass. A wasting condition can occur as a result of a pathology such as for example cancer or it can be due to a physiologic or metabolic state such as disuse deconditioning that can occur for example due to prolonged bed rest or when a limb is immobilized such as in a cast or with the occurrence of multiple wounds including for example amputation as occurs in diabetics and other conditions as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. A wasting condition can also be age associated. The loss of body mass that occurs during a wasting condition can be characterized by a loss of total body weight or a loss of organ weight such as a loss of bone or muscle mass due to a decrease in tissue protein.

In one embodiment the terms muscle wasting or muscular wasting refer to the progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement cardiac muscles which control the heart and smooth muscles. In one embodiment the muscle wasting condition or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. Chronic muscle wasting is defined herein as the chronic i.e. persisting over a long period of time progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the chronic progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle.

The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation an unusually low rate of protein synthesis or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term catabolism has its commonly known meaning in the art specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.

In some embodiments the SARMs as herein described and or compositions comprising the same may be used for applications in or treating diseases or conditions associated with a subject having diabetes. In one embodiment the subject for whom treatment is sought via the methods of this invention is one with diabetic I. Type I diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Markers of immune destruction of the beta cell are present at the time of diagnosis in 90 of individuals and include antibodies to the islet cell ICAs to glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD and to insulin lAAs . While this form of diabetes usually occurs in children and adolescents it can occur at any age. Younger individuals typically have a rapid rate of beta cell destruction and present with ketoacidosis while adults often maintain sufficient insulin secretion to prevent ketoacidosis for many years. Eventually all type I diabetic patients require insulin therapy to maintain nornglycemia.

In one embodiment this invention provides a method of treating diabetes type II. Type II diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and at some stage in pathogenesis of the disease a relative deficiency of insulin secretion. In absolute terms the plasma insulin concentration both fasting and meal stimulated usually is increased although relative to the severity of insulin resistance the plasma insulin concentration is insufficient to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. With time however there is progressive beta cell failure and absolute insulin deficiency ensues. Most individuals with type II diabetes exhibit intra abdominal visceral obesity fatty liver which is closely related to the presence of insulin resistance. The patient s liver becomes insulin resistant and glycogen breakdown is uncontrolled and the result is increased and unphysiological glucose delivery to the bloodstream. The liver generated cholesterol and VLDL particles is also uncontrolled. In addition hypertension dyslipidemia high triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol levels postprandial hyperlipemia and elevated PAI 1 levels often are present in these individuals. This clustering of abnormalities is referred to as the insulin resistance syndrome or the metabolic syndrome or obesity related disorders. Because of these abnormalities patients with type II diabetes are at increased risk of developing macrovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

In one embodiment this invention provides a method of treating diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes that evolves early typically before clinical diagnosis of diabetes is made. The earliest clinical evidence of nephropathy is the appearance of low but abnormal levels 30 mg day or 20 g min of albumin in the urine microalbuminuria followed by albuminuria 300 mg 24 h or 200 g min that develops over a period of 10 15 years. In patients with type 1 diabetes diabetic hypertension typically becomes manifest early on by the time that patients develop microalbuminuria. Once overt nephropathy occurs the glomerular filtration rate GFR falls over a course of times which may be several years resulting in End Stage Renal Disease ESRD in diabetic individuals.

In one embodiment this invention provides a method of treating diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy is a family of nerve disorders caused by diabetes. Diabetic neuropathies cause numbness and sometimes pain and weakness in the hands arms feet and legs. Neurologic problems in diabetes may occur in every organ system including the digestive tract heart and genitalia. Diabetic neuropathies are classified as peripheral autonomic proximal and focal. Peripheral neuropathy causes pain or loss of feeling in the toes feet legs hands and arms. Autonomic neuropathy causes changes in digestion bowel and bladder function sexual response and perspiration and can also affect the nerves that serve the heart and control blood pressure. Proximal neuropathy causes pain in the thighs hips or buttocks and leads to weakness in the legs. Focal neuropathy results in the sudden weakness of one nerve or a group of nerves causing muscle weakness or pain. Any nerve in the body may be affected.

In one embodiment this invention provides a method of treating diabetic retinopathy. The effect of diabetes on the eye is called diabetic retinopathy. Patients with diabetes are more likely to develop eye problems such as cataracts and glaucoma. The affect of diabetic retinopathy on vision varies widely depending on the stage of the disease. Some common symptoms of diabetic retinopathy are blurred vision this is often linked to blood sugar levels floaters and flashes and sudden loss of vision.

In one embodiment the subject for whom treatment is sought via the methods of this invention is one with glucose intolerance. Glucose intolerance is a pre diabetic state in which the blood glucose is higher than normal but not high enough to warrant the diagnosis of diabetes.

In one embodiment the subject for whom treatment is sought via the methods of this invention is one with hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia is a sign of an underlying problem that is causing the pancreas to secrete excessive amounts of insulin. The most common cause of hyperinsulinemia is insulin resistance a condition in which your body is resistant to the effects of insulin and the pancreas tries to compensate by making more insulin. Hyperinsulinemia is associated with type II diabetes

In one embodiment the subject for whom treatment is sought via the methods of this invention is one with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a condition in which normal amounts of insulin are inadequate to produce a normal insulin response from fat muscle and liver cells. Insulin resistance in fat cells results in hydrolysis of stored triglycerides which elevates free fatty acids in the blood plasma. Insulin resistance in muscle reduces glucose uptake whereas insulin resistance in liver reduces glucose storage with both effects serving to elevate blood glucose. High plasma levels of insulin and glucose due to insulin resistance often leads to the metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes.

Diabetes and the liver obesity is typically associated with elevated levels of free fatty acid FFAs that promote lipid accumulation and insulin resistance in target tissues i.e. reduced action of insulin primarily in skeletal muscle and liver. A prominent role of insulin is to reduce glucose output from the liver. FFAs stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis which per se does not lead to increased hepatic glucose output as long as it is paralleled by a decrease in hepatic glycogenolysis a compensatory process referred to as hepatic autoregulation . FFAs stimulate insulin secretion and insulin blocks glycogenolysis in part by inhibiting secretion of glucagon an inducer of glycogenolysis. However long term elevated levels of FFAs leads to hepatic insulin resistance and thus breakdown of hepatic autoregulation resulting in increased hepatic glucose production and development of type II diabetes. Fatty liver and hepatic insulin resistance is a major driving force behind hyperglycemia and type II diabetes.

In one embodiment this invention provides methods that inhibit improve the fatty liver resulting in that the insulin resistance in the liver is inhibited improved and thereby solving the basic problem in type II diabetes.

The following examples are presented in order to more fully illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention. They should in no way however be construed as limiting the broad scope of the invention.

Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 200 g were purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science Indianapolis Ind. . The animals were maintained on a 12 h light dark cycle with food 7012C LM485 Mouse Rat Sterilizable Diet Harlan Teklad Madison Wis. and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tennessee. Anabolic and androgenic activity of Compound III in intact animals was evaluated and also compared to Oxandrolone and the dose response in acutely orchidectomized ORX animals was evaluated as well. Regenerative effects of Compound III in chronically 9 days ORX rats were also assessed.

The compound was weighed and dissolved in 10 DMSO Fisher diluted with PEG 300 Acros Organics NJ for preparation of the appropriate dosage concentrations. The animals were housed in groups of 2 to 3 animals per cage. Intact and ORX animals were randomly assigned to one of seven groups consisting of 4 to 5 animals per group. Control groups intact and ORX were administered vehicle daily. Compound III was administered via oral gavage at doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day to both intact and ORX groups.

Castrated animals on day one of the study were randomly assigned to dose groups 4 5 animals group of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day for dose response evaluation. Dosing began nine days post ORX and was administered daily via oral gavage for fourteen days. The animals were sacrificed under anesthesia ketamine xyalzine 87 13 mg kg after a 14 day dosing regimen and body weights were recorded. In addition ventral prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani muscle were removed individually weighed normalized to body weight and expressed as a percentage of intact control. Student s T test was used to compare individual dose groups to the intact control group. Significance was defined a priori as a P value

Prostate weights following Compound III treatment were 111 21 88 15 77 17 71 16 71 10 and 87 13 of intact controls following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively . Similarly seminal vesicle weights decreased to 94 9 77 11 80 9 73 12 77 10 and 88 14 of intact controls following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively . Significant increases were seen in levator ani muscle weights of sham animals however in all dose groups when compared to intact controls. The levator ani muscle weights were 120 12 116 7 128 7 134 7 125 9 and 146 17 of intact controls corresponding to 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day dose groups respectively .

Compound III exhibited anabolic muscle prostate ratio in castrated rats of 7.56 4.28 2.21 2.19 1.57 and 1.75 following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively.

Compound III partially maintained prostate weight following orchidectomy. Prostate weight in vehicle treated ORX controls decreased to 5 1 of intact controls. At doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day Compound III maintained prostate weights at 8 2 20 5 51 19 56 9 80 28 and 74 12.5 of intact controls respectively. .

Compound III partially maintained seminal vesicle weights in ORX animals as well. While in castrated controls seminal vesicle weight decreased to 13 2 of intact controls Compound III treated animal weights were 12 4 17 5 35 10 61 15 70 14 and 80 6 of intact controls following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day respectively .

In ORX controls the levator ani muscle weight decreased to 55 7 of intact controls while Compound III treated animals fully maintained and increased levaor ani muscle weights at doses 0.1 mg day with muscle weights of 59 6 85 9 112 10 122 16 127 12 and 130 2 of intact control weights for the 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day dose groups respectively observed. .

Levator ani muscle weight in intact rats following Compound III treatment were 120 10 118 5 130 5 135 5 122 10 and 145 20 of intact controls for the 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day doses respectively.

Prostate weight in intact rats following Compound III treatment were 110 10 90 15 80 15 70 15 70 15 and 90 15 of intact controls for the 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day doses respectively.

Pharmacology results following 1 mg day of compound III exhibited that prostate weight was 87 13 of intact control and levator ani muscle weight was 146 17 of intact control. Compound III maintained prostate weight following orchidectomy at 74 12.5 of intact controls and levator ani muscle weight at 130 2 of intact controls. 0.1 mg day of Compound III restored 100 of levator ani muscle weight while 51 20 prostate weight was restored.

Oxandrolone treatment of ORX animals was less anabolic than Compound III with levator ani weights being 50 of intact controls and not dosage dependant when administered at 0.1 1 mg day .

Eand ED were determined in each tissue by nonlinear regression analysis in WinNonlin and presented in . ED50 indicates the dose of Compound III resulting in 50 of the maximal response which is the E. Evalues were 83 25 85 11 and 131 2 for prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani respectively. The EDin prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani was 0.09 0.07 0.17 0.05 and 0.02 0.01 mg day respectively.

Serum LH and FSH concentrations for the animals are presented in Table 2. LH decreased in a dose dependent manner in both intact and castrated animals as a function of treatment with the compound. Following doses 0.1 mg day LH levels were below the limit of quantitation 0.07 ng mL . The 0.1 mg day dose in ORX animals returned LH levels back to those seen in intact controls. Similar effects were observed with FSH. In intact animals a significant decrease in FSH levels was observed with the 0.75 and 1 mg day doses. In ORX animals a dose dependent decrease in FSH levels was observed. Doses of Compound III 0.1 mg day in ORX animals returned FSH levels to those of intact controls.

Compound III partially restored both prostate and seminal vesicle weight in ORX animals. Prostate weights were restored to 9 3 11 3 23 5 50 13 62 12 and 71 5 while seminal vesicle weights were restored 7 1 9 1 23 8 49 5 67 12 and 67 11 of intact controls for 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day dose groups respectively. Compound III fully restored levator ani muscle weight at doses 0.1 mg day. Levator ani muscle weights were restored to 56 7 82 9 103 11 113 11 121 7 and 120 7 corresponding to doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day respectively. Results are presented graphically in . Eand EDvalues were determined in each tissue by nonlinear regression analysis in WinNonlin and presented in . Evalues were 75 8 73 3 and 126 4 for prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani respectively. The EDin prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani was 0.22 0.05 0.21 0.02 and 0.013 0.01 mg day respectively.

One hundred Sprague Dawley rats 50 male and 50 female were divided into five groups n 10 per gender per group representing vehicle only PEG300 40 Cavasol 75 25 v v and four dose groups of Compound III. Animals were administered Compound III once daily by oral gavage according to their most recent body weight with doses of either 0 3 10 30 or 100 mg kg. During the study period rats had access to water and a standard laboratory diet of Harlan Taklad Rodent Chow ad libitum. After 28 consecutive days of dosing animals were fasted overnight blood samples were collected and serum was obtained. Serum levels of total cholesterol were determined using an automated laboratory assay method.

The male and female rats in the vehicle only group 0 mg kg had serum total cholesterol values of 92 13.5 and 102 13 mg dL respectively. These values are considered within the normal historical range for the testing laboratory. Daily oral doses of Compound III at or above 3 mg kg caused a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels in both male and female rats. At 3 mg kg compared to vehicle control animals an approximate 30 reduction in total cholesterol was noted where males and females had 63 17.4 and 74 14.2 mg dL respectively. Although a slightly greater effect was noted at the highest dose group 100 mg kg per day in general a dose response relationship was not observed in the reduction of total cholesterol levels in the Sprague Dawley rat. Results are presented graphically in .

Five groups of 24 human subjects per group 12 males and 12 females of 60 elderly men age 60 and 60 postmenopausal women not hypogonadal not osteoporotic no exercise program no controlled diet were dosed each in a randomized double blind study design. Each subject received 0.1 mg 0.3 mg 1 mg and 3 mg Compound III or placebo of equal volume in solution or in experimental capsules for 90 days treatment. Total lean body mass DEXA dual energy x ray absorptiometry fat mass and performance were analyzed.

All subjects average age 64 years n 114 exhibited a dose dependent increase in Lean Body Mass LBM following treatment with 0.1 mg 0.3 mg 1 mg and 3 mg of Compound III .

Treatment with 3 mg Compound III exhibited LBM increase of about 3.1 3.4 compared to baseline with a p

Females average age 63 years n 56 exhibited a dose dependent increase in LBM when administered a 3 mg dose of Compound III with an increase of 1.7 kg compared to baseline and an increase of 1.4 kg compared to placebo with a p 0.02 ANOVA . Females administered the 1 mg dose of Compound III exhibited an increase of 0.4 kg compared to baseline and no changes compared to placebo with a p 0.884 ANOVA 

Males Average age 66 years n 58 exhibited a dose dependent increase in LBM when administered a 1 mg dose of Compound III with an increase of 0.7 kg compared to baseline and an increase of 1.2 kg compared to placebo with a p 0.03 ANOVA . Males administered the 3 mg dose of Compound III exhibited an increase of 1 kg compared to baseline and an increase of 1.4 kg compared to placebo with a p 0.005 ANOVA .

All subjects exhibited a dose dependent decrease in total fat for the 0.3 mg 1 mg and 3 mg doses of Compound III with p 0.242 0.085 and 0.049 respectively. All subjects exhibited an increase in fat mass for the 0.1 mg . At 3 mg the loss was 0.6 kg compared to placebo and 0.3 kg 0.4 from baseline with a p 0.049.

The site of fat loss was different among males and females. Males tended to lose from the trunk abdomen about 1.4 kg compared to the placebo and 0.5 kg from baseline with 3 mg p 0.237 and 1.7 kg compared to the placebo and 0.8 kg from baseline with 1 mg p 0.810 doses. Females tended to lose from the thigh and legs about 1 kg compared to the placebo and 0.5 kg from baseline with 1 mg p 0.038 and 3 mg p 0.212 doses.

Total tissue percent fat relative to lean muscle mass decreased in a dose dependent fashion at the 1 mg dose achieving p 0.02 ANOVA and at 3 mg achieving p 0.006 ANOVA for all subjects. The decrease in tissue percent fat in women administering 3 mg was highest compared to administering 1 mg of Compound III and compared to men administered the same doses.

In order to analyze the physical performance which reflects the gain of quality LBM a stair climb time and power study was conducted. Subjects climbed 12 stairs and data was collected as a function of time speed and power.

Speed A dose dependent decrease in the time needed to climb 12 stairs was observed with the 3 mg dose of Compound III showing a 15.5 decrease in time p 0.006 ANOVA .

Power Exerted A dose dependent increase in power was observed. In subjects with the 3 mg dose of Compound III there was 25.5 more power observed than in the placebo group p 0.005 ANOVA . An increase of 62 watts is approximately 8 times what is considered clinically significant in a middle aged to elderly non athlete.

Thus Compound III built lean body mass in both men and women and lowered the percent body fat. This lean body mass improvement translated to improved performance and power on a stair climb which indicates inter alia that Compound III improves strength and provides a clinical benefit in the elderly and in persons where a condition such as cancer or chronic kidney disease has caused muscle wasting.

Bone Mineral Density BMD DEXA BMD measurements in treated patients were not different from baseline or from placebo. This was not unexpected since 90 days of dosing and measurement is insufficient time to observe meaningful changes in BMD.

Bone resorption and turnover markers In preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of osteoporosis tested Compound III demonstrated both anabolic and antiresorptive activity affecting both the osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

Compound III was shown to be safe and well tolerated. There were no trends in AEs and there were no SAEs reported during 90 day study period.

It is well known that natural anabolic steroids and synthetic anabolic steroids induce elevations in liver transaminases in particular ALT and AST. Compound III in contrast appeared to minimally affect ALT and AST levels. Of the 120 patients evaluated 1 female patient exhibited an isolated ALT elevation with no other clinically meaningful changes including no changes in alkaline phosphatase GTT and total bilirubin levels. Of the 114 patients that completed the trial there were no clinically meaningful changes in ALT AST alkaline phosphatase GGT or bilirubin levels at 3 months post initiation.

Circulating cholesterol LDL VLDL triglyceride and HDL levels were analyzed High dose testosterone and other anabolic steroids have the ability to reduce cholesterol and profoundly reduce HDL 60 80 . Compound III reduced total cholesterol LDL VLDL and triglycerides in a dose dependent manner. A dose dependent reduction in HDL was seen as well however not of the magnitude of other orally administered anabolic agents. LDL HDL ratios which are a well established way to identify cardiovascular risk revealed that Compound III treated subjects and placebo groups were in the low or below cardiovascular risk category at all doses.

All subjects total body weight was measured post administration of Compound III. A dose dependent change in total body weight of all subjects given a 0.1 mg 0.3 mg 1 mg and 3 mg dose of Compound III was observed. Treatment with 0.3 mg or 3 mg Compound III exhibited an increase of 1 kg compared to placebo and 0.9 kg from baseline with a p 0.196 and 0.178 respectively ANOVA .

A dose dependent change in total body weight of women given a 3 mg dose of Compound III was observed with an increase of 0.8 kg compared to placebo and 1.63 kg from baseline with a p 0.279 ANOVA and with the 1 mg dose a decrease of 0.9 kg compared to the placebo with a p 0.215 ANOVA .

A dose dependent change in total body weight of men with the 3 mg dose of Compound III was observed with an increase of 0.7 kg compared to placebo with a p 0.277 ANOVA and with the 1 mg dose an increase of 1 kg compared to the placebo with a p 0.193 ANOVA .

Testosterone and other anabolic steroid agents suppress LH secretion by feedback inhibition on the pituitary. Less LH leads to lower endogenously produced testosterone. LH levels U L changed relative to placebo groups as a function of treatment with Compound III.

Administration of 0.1 mg to women led to a 1.2 1.14 U L increase p 0.01 in LH to a 0.8 1.14 U L decrease p 0.466 in men.

Administration of 0.3 mg to women led to a 1.8 1.09 U L decrease p 0.403 in LH to a 0.1 1.19 U L increase p 0.834 in men.

Administration of 1 mg to women led to a 2.6 1.19 U L decrease p 0.780 in LH to a 0.7 1.14 U L decrease p 0.476 in men.

Administration of 3 mg to women led to a 6.4 1.14 U L reduction p 0.039 in LH to a 0.5 1.09 U L decrease p 0.543 in men.

SHBG is a sensitive marker of anabolic activity. Anabolic agents lower SHBG levels. In this study consistent with its anabolic activity Compound III exhibited a dose dependent profound reduction of SHBG levels. Administration of 0.1 mg 0.3 mg 1 mg or 3 mg Compound III resulted in reduction of SHBG levels in men and women.

Endogenous free testosterone levels decreased relative to placebo groups post administration of 0.1 mg 0.3 mg or 1 mg to women and had no change relative to placebo post administration of 3 mg Compound III.

Free testosterone levels in men increased relative to placebo groups post administration of 0.1 mg 0.3 or 3 mg of Compound III and had almost no change relative to placebo groups post administration of 1 mg Compound III.

A potential side effect of testosterone and other androgenic anabolic steroids is stimulation of the prostate. Measurement of serum PSA is a sensitive measure of stimulation of the prostate gland. Compound III had no effect on serum PSA levels at any dose tested.

Androgenic steroids stimulate sebaceous glands which play a role in producing sebum and hair. Compound III did not show any significant changes in hair growth in women. Increased sebum production can lead to acne and oily skin an unwanted side effect. Sebum production was measured in both men and women. Compound III did not affect sebum production in men or women compared to placebo had no virilization effect and did not cause Acne in men and women.

Compound III a built lean body mass in both men and women and lowered the percent body fat b improved performance and power on a stair climb thus improving strength and providing a clinical benefit in the elderly and in people where a condition such as cancer or chronic kidney disease has caused muscle wasting c was minimally androgenic thus diminishing risks of hirsitism and prostate cancer currently associated with non specific androgenic agents and d was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported.

In addition there were reductions in total cholesterol LDL and HDL levels. There were no AEs or detrimental changes in other cardiovascular risk factors as measured in the study such as blood pressure insulin sensitivity . The data shows that there is a 20 decline in HDL while LDL triglycerides and total cholesterol are lowered in the presence of increased muscle and decreased body fat.

A 1.5 kg 3.3 lb improvement in lean body mass is clinically meaningful and consistent with what is seen with other anabolic agents. As men lose a lb. per year this would represent reversing 7 years of muscle loss in 3 months. The lean body mass improvement translates to an improvement in function and muscle power. The improvement was seen in both men and women at the same dose that improved muscle mass. This indicates that if the SARM compound of formula III delivers the same lean body mass improvement in the elderly population or those people suffering from conditions which accelerate muscle wasting then it would also provide a functional benefit and improved quality of life.

Female Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups representing sham vehicle treated ovarioectomized OVX sham treated and OVX animals receiving 3 mg day Compound III. Compound III and vehicle were administered once daily by oral gavage. After 42 consecutive days of dosing animals were sacrificed the left hind limb soleus muscle was dissected and tested for strength analysis. The ratio between Pthe peak titanic tension N and CSA the cross sectional area cm was determined.

Female rats exhibited improvement in soleus strength. Sham treated and ovarioectomized OVX sham treated animals exhibited a strength of about 30 N cm while OVX Compound III treated animals exhibited a strength of about 40 N cm. Results are presented graphically in .

Sixty female virgin intact Sprague Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Wilmington Mass. and aged to 23 wks. The animals were housed 2 3 per cage and acclimated to a 12 h light dark cycle. Food 7012C LM 485 Mouse Rat Sterilizable Diet Harlan Teklad Madison Wis. and water were provided ad libitum. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tennessee reviewed and approved the animal protocol for this study.

Sham surgeries or ovariectomies were performed on Day 0. The study was comprised of eight treatment groups as follows I intact vehicle 2 intact COMPOUND III 3 OVX vehicle 4 OVX COMPOUND IIII 5 OVX DHT 6 OVX E2 7 OVX alendronate 8 OVX alendronate COMPOUND m. Doses were administered daily via oral gavage in a vehicle of DMSO PEG300 10 90 beginning on Day 1. Animals were sacrificed on Day 45 of the study. Femurs were removed cleared of soft tissue and stored in saline soaked gauze at 20 C. until analysis. Nine animals died during the course of the study. These deaths were attributed to surgical complications arising from the ovariectomies and technical errors during oral dosing i.e. dosing solution delivered into the lungs . Dose groups are listed in the table below 

The left femurs were sent to SkeleTech Inc. Bothell Wash. for biomechanical strength three point bending and pQCT analysis. A Stratec XCT RM and associated software Stratec Medizintechnik GmbH Pforzheim Germany. Software version 5.40 C were used for the pQCT analysis. The femur was analyzed at both the mid shaft and distal regions. The mid shaft analysis was performed on the region at 50 of the length of the femur. The distal analysis was performed on the region at 20 of the length of the femur starting at the distal end. One 0.5 mm slice perpendicular to the long axis of the femur was used for analysis. Total bone mineral content total bone area total bone mineral density cortical bone mineral content cortical bone area cortical bone mineral density cortical thickness periosteal perimeter circumference and endosteal perimeter were determined at the mid shaft of the femur. At the distal femur total bone mineral content total bone area total bone mineral density trabecular bone mineral content trabecular bone area and trabecular bone mineral density were determined. Following pQCT analysis the femoral strength was determined by a three point bending test. The anterior to posterior diameter APD unit mm at the midpoint of the femoral shaft was measured with an electronic caliper. The femur was placed on the lower supports of a three point bending fixture wiith the anterior side of the femur facing downward in an Instron Mechanical Testing Machine Instron 4465 retrofitted to 5500 Canton Mass. . The length L between the lower supports was set to 14 mm. The upper loading device was aligned to the center of the femoral shaft. The load was applied at a constant displacement rate of 6 mm min until the femur broke. The mechanical testing machine directly measured the maximum load F unit N stiffness S units N mm and energy absorbed W unit mJ . The axial area moment of inertia I unit mm was calculated by the software during the pQCT analysis of the femoral mid shaft. Stress units N mm elastic modulus E unit Mpa and toughness T units mJ m were calculated by the following formulas stress F L a 2 4 I elastic modulus E S L 48 I and toughness T 3 W APD 2 L I .

Statistical analysis was performed by Student s T test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant differences.

Male rats were subjected to Orchiectomy ORX and on days 1 119 were administered perorally by gavage a vehicle different doses of Compound III 0.1 1 and 3 mg d with or without alendronate 1 mg d and alendronate alone. After sacrifice at the indicated times mice were sacrificed fermus removed and subjected to pQCT analysis and a 3 point bending assay. Vertebra were harvested as well and crush assay of L5 was conducted. Tibias were subjected to static and dynamic histomorphometry calcein .

Trabecular bone mineral density was analyzed by pQCT at the distal femur. Results are shown in . Significant trabecular bone loss was observed following OVX. Trabecular bone density decreased from 379 to 215 mg mmin the intact and OVX vehicle control groups respectively. In intact animals treated with Compound III a slight increase in trabecular bone density to 398 mg mmwas observed. In OVX animals treated with Compound III a significant increase was observed over the OVX vehicle control group to 406 mg mm. DHT increased trabecular bone density over the OVX vehicle control group to 360 mg mmand estradiol E2 increased trabecular bone density to 415 mg mm. Alendronate increased trabecular bone density to 480 mg mm. The combination therapy of Alendronate and Compound III showed additive effects increasing trabecular bone density to 552 mg mm.

Rat distal femur representative reconstructions were prepared by standard methodology. As seen in while OVX animals show pronounced loss of normal architecture panel B OVX Compound III treated animals provided a structure comparable to intact controls panel D .

Ovariectomized animals may serve as a model for females suffering from ADIF and as such one embodiment of this invention is treatment thereof for example via administration of Compound III as exemplified herein.

As evident from BV TV and D trabecular number Compound III prevented gonadectomy induced losses in trabecular bone in males as well.

In order to determine the pharmacokinetics of Compound III the compound was administered to beagle dogs perorally and circulating plasma levels Cmax tmax t1 2 AUC and F and the Table below respectively were determined. Comound III was rapidly and completely absorbed.

LNCaP prostate cancer cells were obtained from ATCC Manassas Va. . The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 2 mM L glutamine 10 mM HEPES 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate penicillin and streptomycin supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS . For the ChIP assays cells were plated in 150 mm dishes at 10 million cells per dish in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 charcoal stripped FBS. The cells were maintained in 1 csFBS for 6 days to reduce basal occupancy of promoters with medium changed on days 1 and 3 and before treatment on day 6.

ChIP assays were performed as described earlier Narayanan R. et al. 2005 . The proteins were cross linked by incubation with 1 formaldehyde final concentration at 37 C. for 10 min. The cells were washed with 1 PBS twice scraped in 1 ml of PBS containing protease inhibitors 1 mg each of aprotinin leupeptin antipain benzamidine HCl and pepstatin ml 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mM sodium vanadate pelleted and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer 1 SDS 10 mM EDTA 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.1 . After lysis on ice for 10 min the cell extract was sonicated Branson sonifier 250 in a cold room eight times for 10 s each at constant duty cycle with an output of 3 and with incubation on ice after every sonication. The debris was pelleted at 13 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C. and the supernatant was diluted 10 fold with ChIP dilution buffer 0.01 SDS 1.1 Triton X 100 1.2 mM EDTA 16.7 mM Tris HCl pH 8.1 167 mM NaCl . The proteins were precleared with 50 l of 1 1 protein A Sepharose beads in TE 300 l was reserved as input and the remaining was incubated with 5 g of AR or SRC 1 antibody or IgG negative control and 2 g of sheared salmon sperm DNA Stratagene La Jolla Calif. rotating overnight at 4 C. The protein DNA antibody complex was precipitated by incubating with 100 l of 1 1 protein A Sepharose beads and 2 g of salmon sperm DNA at 4 C. for 2 h. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with low salt wash buffer 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS 1 Triton X 100 2 mM EDTA 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.1 0.15 M NaCl and twice with 1 TE 10 mM Tris HCl 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 . The DNA protein complex was obtained by extracting the beads with 50 l of freshly prepared extraction buffer 1 SDS 0.1 M NaHCO three times. The cross linking of the DNA protein complex was reversed by incubating at 65 C. for 6 h. The DNA was extracted with a QIAquick PCR purification kit QIAGEN Valencia Calif. in 25 l final volume of TE.

The realtime PCR was performed on an ABI 7300 Applied Biosystems using TaqMan PCR master mix at universal condition. The numbers on the y axis of the ChIP assay results were obtained by dividing the arbitrary quantitative PCR numbers obtained for each sample by the respective input. All promoter array results were validated using primers and taqman probes Biocource Colo. given in the following table.

H20K promoter array from AVIVA systems biology San Diego Calif. was used for these experiments. The array consists of 20 000 probe pairs mapped to about 19 600 unique proximal promoter regions. Proximal promoter regions between 1.0 KB to 300 bp were spotted on this array. Before hybridization the efficiency of the ChIP assay was tested on PSA enhancer using quantitative PCR. Manufacturer s protocol was followed for the hybridization using Cy5 label for the immunoprecipitated samples and Cy3 label for total input DNA. The hybridized slides were scanned using a Gene Pix 4 scanner. Resulting background subtracted median intensities for both the Cy3 and the Cy5 channels were used to calculate normalized log Cy5 Cy3 or M values in the limmaGUIpackage developed for the R statistical language. In limmaGUI background subtraction was set to minimum replacing confounding negative or zero intensities with very small positive numbers. Default settings were used for spot quality weighting and all arrays were within array normalized using the global loess function and between array normalized using the aquantile method as needed. A one tailed students t test was used to determine significance P

The software package ErmineJwas used to mine statistically overrepresented GO terms from each experimental group and successfully mapped 80 of array targets to their GO annotation. An implementation of the receiver operator characteristic ROC method was used in ranking log p values NLP of all genes showing recruitment and performing the wilcoxon rank sum test to examine significance of gene sets minimum size 20 associated with GO terms containing a greater number of high ranking genes than would be expected if rankings were randomly distributed amongst all gene sets. Only the most significant NLP of replicates within each array were considered. p

Five male Sprague Dawley rats per group 300 g from Harlan Indianapolis Ind. were housed with three animals per cage and were allowed free access to tap water and commercial rat chow Harlan Teklad 22 5 rodent diet 8640 . During the course of the study the animals were maintained on a 12 hr light dark cycle. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Care and Use Committee of The University of Tennessee. The animals were dosed daily for 15 days with 3 mg day of SARM or DHT or vehicle Polyethylene Glycol . Dosing solutions were prepared daily by dissolving drug in dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO and diluting in polyethylene glycol 300 PEG 300 . At the end of 15 days the animals were sacrificed and the weights of prostate and levator ani measured.

Cell culture materials were obtained from Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . The femurs were first rinsed in 70 ethanol and were then washed three times with 5 ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Both ends of the femurs were snapped and the bone marrow cells were flushed with 15 ml of MEM with penicillin streptomycin and fungizone into a 50 ml conical tube and stored on ice. The bone marrow cells were pooled and were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min in a clinical centrifuge. The cells were resuspended in phenol red free MEM supplemented with 10 charcoal stripped serum penicillin streptomycin and fungizone. The cells were triturated through a 22 g needle counted under microscope and were plated at 1.5 million cells per well of a 6 well plate in phenol red free MEM supplemented with 15 charcoal stripped serum penicillin streptomycin 300 ng ml fungizone 0.28 mM ascorbic acid and 10 mM glycerophosphate to differentiate towards the fibroblast osteoblast lineage. In separate wells 2.5 million cells per well were plated in 24 well plates in phenol red free MEM supplemented with 10 charcoal stripped serum penicillin streptomycin and 300 ng ml fungizone to differentiate towards the osteoclast lineage. The medium was changed on day 2 and the cells were treated with the compound of interest. Osteoclast cultures were performed in the presence of RANK Ligand 50 ng and GM CSF 10 ng to induce osteoclastogenesis. Medium was completely changed every third day for osteoclast cultures. For fibroblast cultures half the culture medium was changed every third day to leave the growth factors secreted by the cells

At the end of 12 days the cells were fixed in 10 buffered formalin for fibroblast cultures and in 4 formaldehyde in PBS for osteoclast cultures. The fibroblasts were stained for alkaline phosphatase activity and the O.D. at 405 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer as described earlier. The osteoclasts were stained for Tartarate Resistant Acid Phosphatase Activity TRAP and cells having 2 or more nuclei were counted under the microscope.

LNCaP cells were plated at 700 000 cells per well of a 6 well plate in RPMI supplemented with 1 csFBS or in full serum. The cells were maintained for 3 days and were treated with vehicle DHT or SARM. RNA was isolated using Trizol Invitrogen and the expression of various genes measured using TaqMan primer probe mix from Applied Biosystems using one step rtPCR master mix on an ABI 7300 realtime PCR machine. The expression of individual gene is normalized to 18S rRNA levels.

LNCaP cells were plated at 10 000 cells per well of a 96 well plate in RPMI supplemented with 1 csFBS. The cells were treated for 72 hrs with the indicated concentrations of DHT or SARM. The cell viability at the end of 72 hrs measured using WTS assay reagent.

LNCaP cells were plated at 4 million cells per 10 cm dish in RPMI supplemented with 1 csFBS. The cells were maintained in 1 csFBS containing medium for 2 days. The medium was changed and were treated with vehicle 100 nM DHT or SARM for 1 hr. Protein was extracted in Homogenization buffer 0.05 M potassium phosphate 10 mM sodium molybdate 50 mM sodium fluoride 2 mM EDTA 2 mM EGTA and 0.05 monothioglycerol pH 7.4 containing 0.4 M NaCl and the protease inhibitors mentioned above by three freeze thaw cycles in dry ice ethanol bath. Equal amounts of protein 100 g were immunoprecipitated with SHC 1 antibody or IgG over night rotating at 4 C. The protein antibody complex was precipitated by the addition of protein A sepharose for 2 hrs. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with low salt wash buffer and twice with TE. The proteins were extracted from the beads by boiling for 10 min with 2 Laemmli buffer. The protein extracts were fractionated on a 6.5 SDS PAGE transferred to a nitrocellulose and western blotted with SRC 1 antibody.

A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay ChIP assay was coupled with DNA microarray to determine the genome wide binding of AR to various proximal promoter regions. LNCaP cells were treated with DHT or SARM and equal amounts of DNA were hybridized to the transcription factor promoter array. AR significantly associated with 1303 of the promoter regions for known protein coding genes in the presence of DHT or SARM . AR bound to nearly 6.5 of the promoters spotted on the array. Although DHT and SARM stimulated the recruitment of AR to a similar number of gene promoters only 118 of the 1303 promoters were shared. In response to DHT 626 promoters were uniquely occupied while in response to SARM 559 promoters were uniquely occupied by AR. Functional analysis of the genes revealed profound differences in the functional activity of these genes . DHT promoted recruitment of the AR to 71 and 63 of the genes associated with cell growth and extracellular matrix respectively while only 29 and 31 respectively of these promoters were occupied by the AR in response to SARM. In contrast SARM stimulated recruitment of the AR to 63 of the genes associated with an external stimulus eg. intracellular signaling pathways . Genes associated with cytoskeleton reproduction development transcription and metabolism were associated about equally with DHT and SARM treatment. A comparative genomics search was used to identify the presence of AREs in the 1303 gene promoters. Totally 712 of the 1303 gene promoters were sufficiently annotated in the human and mouse database for this search. 78 of 350 searched promoters recruiting AR in response to DHT contained AREs whereas 69 of 277 SARM responsive promoters were classified as ARE positive .

SRC 1 was efficiently recruited in the presence of DHT and SARM . Using promoter array and identical conditions to that used for AR we mapped SRC 1 binding to 285 promoters . DHT recruited SRC 1 to 498 promoters SARM recruited SRC 1 to 640 promoters and DHT or SARM commonly recruited SRC 1 to 147 promoters. Functional analysis of the genes revealed some significant differences in the functional activity of these genes . DHT promoted recruitment of SRC 1 to 67 and 28 of the genes associated with reproduction and cytoskeleton respectively while 33 and 55 respectively of the promoters were occupied by SRC 1 in response to SARM. Genes associated with other classes were associated equally with DHT and SARM. A comparative genomics search similar to that performed with AR was performed with the list of promoters occupied by SRC 1 to identify the presence of AREs. shows that 77 of the 269 searched promoters recruiting SRC 1 in response to DHT contained AREs whereas 66 of 317 SARM responsive promoters were classified as ARE positive. Array results were validated by performing realtime PCR on the DNA pool obtained from ChIP experiments in LNCaP cells using SRC 1 antibody.
