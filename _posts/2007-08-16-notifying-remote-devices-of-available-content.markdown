According to some embodiments of the invention a download manager module or simply download manager is resident in the memory . The download manager can be included as part of the operating system kernel and or can operate as a separate application program that communicates directly with the operating system as shown in . Alternatively or additionally the download manager can utilize services of the operating system using the application programming interface .

The download manager monitors communications through device drivers which may include for example communication device drivers communication stacks e.g. a TCP IP stack and other device drivers used for communications. The download manager is configured to monitor the downloading and installation of resources such as application programs and or information content by the portable electronic device . That is the download manager monitors external communications of the portable electronic device and determines when the portable electronic device has downloaded a resource such as an executable application program or item of content for example using a data communications protocol such as hypertext transport protocol HTTP file transfer protocol FTP or the like.

When the download manager determines that an executable application program has been downloaded the download manager stores the network address which may include a Uniform Resource Indicator URI from which the application program was downloaded. For example in cases where the application program was downloaded from a provisioning server using a TCP IP connection the download manager may store a network address such as a TCP IP address and or a World Wide Web domain address associated with the provisioning server . The download manager then creates a record that associates the stored network address of the source of the application program with the application program executable file that was downloaded to the portable electronic device . The record is then stored in a database in the electronic memory and or in the storage device of the device .

A Uniform Resource Identifier URI is a compact string of characters used to identify or name a resource e.g. www.sonyericsson.com . The main purpose of this identification is to enable interaction with remote elements over a network typically the World Wide Web using specific protocols. In some embodiments the URI of the provisioning server from which the application was downloaded could be combined with added to the downloaded application package. The download manager can then retrieve the URI from the application program package instead of from a separate database record.

In some embodiments the download manager may also be configured to monitor the execution of the downloaded executable program. If upon execution of the downloaded executable program another executable program is created or extracted the download manager can associate the extracted executable program with the network address already stored in memory for the downloaded executable program. For example if the initially downloaded application program is a self extracting compressed file that upon execution uncompresses and saves a second executable program i.e. the extracted executable program the download manager can associate the extracted executable program with the network address from which the initial file was downloaded. In this manner all executable programs can be associated with a network address from which they were downloaded can be associated with a network address associated with the source of the program.

The download manager can also be configured to monitor the download of displayable playable content such as audio video and or image files. For example the download manager can keep track of the network addresses of audio video image and or other types of files that are downloaded onto the portable electronic device to be played displayed by application programs such as media players. As is well known in the art particular types of content can be associated with particular application programs or media players so that when an item of a particular type of content is selected the associated media player can be automatically executed and provided with the selected item of content. The media player can then automatically play display the item of content.

Upon downloading a particular item of content the download manager is configured to create a database record that associates the item of content with a network address of the server from which the item of content was obtained Accordingly the download manager can create and maintain a database that identifies items of content such as multimedia content executable application programs and or other resources that have been downloaded onto the portable electronic device and that associates each such item of content executable application program with a network address such as a URI or TCP IP internet address from which the item of content executable application program was obtained.

Accordingly illustrates some operations of a portable electronic device according to some embodiments of the invention. As shown therein the portable electronic device can download a resource such as an executable application program and or item of content Block . The resource can be downloaded for example in response to a user command from a user of the portable electronic device and can be downloaded from a remote provisioning server for example over a TCP IP connection established over the wireless communication link . As described above the download manager can monitor the download of the executable application program item of content and save the network address of the provisioning server from which the executable application program item of content was downloaded Block .

If an executable application program was downloaded the application manager can also monitor the installation of the application program on the portable electronic device and associate any further executable applications that are installed by the downloaded application program e.g. if the downloaded application program was an executable container application with the network address from which the initial executable application was downloaded.

The download manager can then create and store a record in a database in the storage device that associates the downloaded resource with the network address of the provisioning server from which it was downloaded Block .

The portable electronic device then receives a command from the user of the portable electronic device i.e. a snapshot command Block . The snapshot command can be entered via the user interface of the portable electronic device using any suitable mechanism including a keypad touchscreen menu command voice command etc. The portable electronic device then determines if the user desires to take a snapshot of a downloaded application program or an item of content Block . In some embodiments the portable electronic device may prompt the user to determine if a snapshot of an application program or an item of content is desired. In some embodiments different commands keys menu selections may be used depending on whether the user desires to take a snapshot of an application program or an item of content.

In other embodiments however the portable electronic device may automatically determine whether the snapshot should be of an application program or an item of content. For example the download manager can monitor the execution of application programs and items of content. If an item of content is being displayed played when the snapshot command is received then the portable electronic device may determine that a snapshot of the item of content currently being played displayed is desired. If no downloaded items of content are currently being played displayed when the snapshot command is received then the portable electronic device may determine that a snapshot of an active application program is desired.

If it is determined that a snapshot of an executing application program is desired then a screenshot or copy of the image that is displayed on the display screen while the application program is running is saved Block . The portable electronic device retrieves the record created by the download manager associating the executing application program with the network address of the server from which the application program was downloaded Block and builds a metadata field such as an Exchangeable image file format Exit metadata field including the network address of the server from which the application program was downloaded Block . The metadata field is stored in the snapshot image Block .

Exchangeable image file format Exif is a specification for an image file format that is used by a number of digital cameras. The specification uses the existing JPEG TIFF Rev. 6.0 and RIFF WAVE file formats with the addition of specific metadata tags. Exif data is embedded within the image file itself. Image display programs can recognize Exif data and display it alongside the images.

If it is determined that a snapshot of an item of content is desired then the portable electronic device then creates and stores a truncated reduced version of the item of content as a snapshot of the content For example where the item of content is a video file the portable electronic device may create and store a screen shot or snippet of the video file as the snapshot. For an image file the portable electronic device may create and store a thumbnail picture as the snapshot. For an audio signal the portable electronic device may generate a shortened audio clip as the snapshot.

In Block the portable electronic device builds a metadata field including the network address of the location from which the application program was downloaded and stores the metadata field in the snapshot image. In Block the portable electronic device retrieves the record created by the download manager associating the downloaded item of content with the network address from which the item of content was downloaded.

The user of the portable electronic device can then send the snapshot including the metadata identifying the source from which the subject of the snapshot was downloaded to a remote terminal such as a mobile telephone of a friend. The recipient of the snapshot can then view or play the snapshot and can easily download the application item of content identified by the snapshot if desired using the address of the server from which the resource was downloaded and which is stored in metadata in the snapshot. In some embodiments the snapshot may be sent via email or MMS message. A message from the sender may be included with the snapshot.

Operations of the recipient portable electronic device are illustrated in . As illustrated therein a recipient terminal receives the snapshot Block and plays displays the content i.e. the thumbnail screen shot still image sound clip etc. stored in the snapshot Block . The recipient terminal also reads the metadata stored in the snapshot and determines the address of the source from which the content or application represented by the snapshot can be downloaded Block . The recipient terminal can then prompt the user to download the content or application or receive a command from the user to download the content or application Block . In response to a user command the recipient terminal can then download the item of content or application program from the provisioning server at the address specified in the metadata of the snapshot Block .

According to embodiments of the invention downloaded content such as multimedia content and application programs such as games or other applications can be easily and quickly shared by making the source of such content easily available to other users along with a snapshot that identifies the content or application. Moreover files other than multimedia files can be quickly and easily shared by using embodiments of the invention since according to some embodiments snapshots including screen images can be generated and transmitted along with metadata including the address from which the file can be downloaded.

Many alterations and modifications may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art given the benefit of present disclosure without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore it must be understood that the illustrated embodiments have been set forth only for the purposes of example and that it should not be taken as limiting the invention as defined by the following claims. The following claims therefore are to be read to include not only the combination of elements which are literally set forth but all equivalent elements for performing substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain substantially the same result.
