title: Biological markers predictive of anti-cancer response to epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitors
abstract: The present invention provides diagnostic and prognostic methods for predicting the effectiveness of treatment of a cancer patient with an EGFR kinase inhibitor. Methods are provided for predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor, comprising assessing whether the tumor cell has undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), by determining the expression level of epithelial and/or mesenchymal biomarkers, wherein tumor cells that have undergone an EMT are substantially less sensitive to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors. Improved methods for treating cancer patients with EGFR kinase inhibitors that incorporate the above methodology are also provided. Additionally, methods are provided for the identification of new biomarkers that are predictive of responsiveness of tumors to EGFR kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, methods for the identification of agents that restore the sensitivity of tumor cells that have undergone EMT to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors are also provided.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 377 530 filed Mar. 16 2006 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 662 545 filed Mar. 16 2005 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 671 821 filed Apr. 15 2005 all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention is directed to methods for diagnosing and treating cancer patients. In particular the present invention is directed to methods for determining which patients will most benefit from treatment with an epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR kinase inhibitor.

Cancer is a generic name for a wide range of cellular malignancies characterized by unregulated growth lack of differentiation and the ability to invade local tissues and metastasize. These neoplastic malignancies affect with various degrees of prevalence every tissue and organ in the body.

A multitude of therapeutic agents have been developed over the past few decades for the treatment of various types of cancer. The most commonly used types of anticancer agents include DNA alkylating agents e.g. cyclophosphamide ifosfamide antimetabolites e.g. methotrexate a folate antagonist and 5 fluorouracil a pyrimidine antagonist microtubule disrupters e.g. vincristine vinblastine paclitaxel DNA intercalators e.g. doxorubicin daunomycin cisplatin and hormone therapy e.g. tamoxifen flutamide .

The epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR family comprises four closely related receptors HER1 EGFR HER2 HER3 and HER4 involved in cellular responses such as differentiation and proliferation. Over expression of the EGFR kinase or its ligand TGF alpha is frequently associated with many cancers including breast lung colorectal ovarian renal cell bladder head and neck cancers glioblastomas and astrocytomas and is believed to contribute to the malignant growth of these tumors. A specific deletion mutation in the EGFR gene EGFRvIII has also been found to increase cellular tumorigenicity. Activation of EGFR stimulated signaling pathways promote multiple processes that are potentially cancer promoting e.g. proliferation angiogenesis cell motility and invasion decreased apoptosis and induction of drug resistance. Increased HER1 EGFR expression is frequently linked to advanced disease metastases and poor prognosis. For example in NSCLC and gastric cancer increased HER1 EGFR expression has been shown to correlate with a high metastatic rate poor tumor differentiation and increased tumor proliferation.

Mutations which activate the receptor s intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and or increase downstream signaling have been observed in NSCLC and glioblastoma. However the role of mutations as a principle mechanism in conferring sensitivity to EGF receptor inhibitors for example erlotinib TARCEVA or gefitinib IRESSA has been controversial. Recently a mutant form of the full length EGF receptor has been reported to predict responsiveness to the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib Paez J. G. et al. 2004 Science 304 1497 1500 Lynch T. J. et al. 2004 N. Engl. J. Med. 350 2129 2139 . Cell culture studies have shown that cell lines which express the mutant form of the EGF receptor i.e. H3255 were more sensitive to growth inhibition by the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib and that much higher concentrations of gefitinib was required to inhibit the tumor cell lines expressing wild type EGF receptor. These observations suggests that specific mutant forms of the EGF receptor may reflect a greater sensitivity to EGF receptor inhibitors but do not identify a completely non responsive phenotype.

The development for use as anti tumor agents of compounds that directly inhibit the kinase activity of the EGFR as well as antibodies that reduce EGFR kinase activity by blocking EGFR activation are areas of intense research effort de Bono J. S and Rowinsky E. K. 2002 Trends in Mol. Medicine 8 S19 S26 Dancey J. and Sausville E. A. 2003 Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 2 92 313 . Several studies have demonstrated disclosed or suggested that some EGFR kinase inhibitors might improve tumor cell or neoplasia killing when used in combination with certain other anti cancer or chemotherapeutic agents or treatments e.g. Herbst R. S. et al. 2001 Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 1 719 732 Solomon B. et al 2003 Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 55 713 723 Krishnan S. et al. 2003 Frontiers in Bioscience 8 e1 13 Grunwald V. and Hidalgo M. 2003 J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 95 851 867 Seymour L. 2003 Current Opin. Investig.

Drug Discovery 2 92 313 Ciardiello F. et al. 2000 Clin. Cancer Res. 6 2053 2063 and Patent Publication No US 2003 0157104 .

Erlotinib e.g. erlotinib HCl also known as TARCEVA or OSI 774 is an orally available inhibitor of EGFR kinase. In vitro erlotinib has demonstrated substantial inhibitory activity against EGFR kinase in a number of human tumor cell lines including colorectal and breast cancer Moyer J. D. et al. 1997 Cancer Res. 57 4838 and preclinical evaluation has demonstrated activity against a number of EGFR expressing human tumor xenografts Pollack V. A. et al 1999 J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 291 739 . More recently erlotinib has demonstrated promising activity in phase I and II trials in a number of indications including head and neck cancer Soulieres D. et al. 2004 J. Clin. Oncol. 22 77 NSCLC Perez Soler R et al. 2001 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 20 310a abstract 1235 CRC Oza M. et al. 2003 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 196a abstract 785 and MBC Winer E. et al. 2002 Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 76 5115a abstract 445 . In a phase III trial erlotinib monotherapy significantly prolonged survival delayed disease progression and delayed worsening of lung cancer related symptoms in patients with advanced treatment refractory NSCLC Shepherd F. et al. 2004 J. Clin. Oncology 22 14S July 15 Supplement Abstract 7022 . While most of the clinical trial data for erlotinib relate to its use in NSCLC preliminary results from phase I II studies have demonstrated promising activity for erlotinib and capecitabine erlotinib combination therapy in patients with wide range of human solid tumor types including CRC Oza M. et al. 2003 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 196a abstract 785 and MBC Jones R. J. et al. 2003 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 45a abstract 180 . In November 2004 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved TARCEVA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. TARCEVA is the only drug in the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR class to demonstrate in a Phase III clinical trial an increase in survival in advanced NSCLC patients.

An anti neoplastic drug would ideally kill cancer cells selectively with a wide therapeutic index relative to its toxicity towards non malignant cells. It would also retain its efficacy against malignant cells even after prolonged exposure to the drug. Unfortunately none of the current chemotherapies possess such an ideal profile. Instead most possess very narrow therapeutic indexes. Furthermore cancerous cells exposed to slightly sub lethal concentrations of a chemotherapeutic agent will very often develop resistance to such an agent and quite often cross resistance to several other antineoplastic agents as well. Additionally for any given cancer type one frequently cannot predict which patient is likely to respond to a particular treatment even with newer gene targeted therapies such as EGFR kinase inhibitors thus necessitating considerable trial and error often at considerable risk and discomfort to the patient in order to find the most effective therapy.

Thus there is a need for more efficacious treatment for neoplasia and other proliferative disorders and for more effective means for determining which tumors will respond to which treatment. Strategies for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of existing drugs have involved changes in the schedule for their administration and also their use in combination with other anticancer or biochemical modulating agents. Combination therapy is well known as a method that can result in greater efficacy and diminished side effects relative to the use of the therapeutically relevant dose of each agent alone. In some cases the efficacy of the drug combination is additive the efficacy of the combination is approximately equal to the sum of the effects of each drug alone but in other cases the effect is synergistic the efficacy of the combination is greater than the sum of the effects of each drug given alone .

Target specific therapeutic approaches such as erlotinib are generally associated with reduced toxicity compared with conventional cytotoxic agents and therefore lend themselves to use in combination regimens. Promising results have been observed in phase I II studies of erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab Mininberg E. D. et al. 2003 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 627a abstract 2521 and gemcitabine Dragovich T. 2003 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 223a abstract 895 . Recent data in NSCLC phase III trials have shown that first line erlotinib or gefitinib in combination with standard chemotherapy did not improve survival Gatzemeier U. 2004 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 23 617 Abstract 7010 Herbst R. S. 2004 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 23 617 Abstract 7011 Giaccone G. et al. 2004 J. Clin. Oncol. 22 777 Herbst R. et al. 2004 J. Clin. Oncol. 22 785 . However pancreatic cancer phase III trials have shown that first line erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine did improve survival OSI Pharmaceuticals Genentech Roche Pharmaceuticals Press Release Sep. 20 2004 .

Several groups have investigated potential biomarkers to predict a patient s response to EGFR inhibitors see for example PCT publications WO 2004 063709 WO 2005 017493 WO 2004 111273 WO 2004 071572 WO 2005 117553 and WO 2005 070020 and US published patent applications US 2005 0019785 and US 2004 0132097 . However no diagnostic or prognostic tests have yet emerged that can guide practicing physicians in the treatment of their patients with EGFR kinase inhibitors.

During most cancer metastases an important change occurs in a tumor cell known as the epithelial mesenchymal transition EMT Thiery J. P. 2002 Nat. Rev. Cancer 2 442 454 Savagner P. 2001 Bioessays 23 912 923 Kang Y. and Massague J. 2004 Cell 118 277 279 Julien Grille S. et al. Cancer Research 63 2172 2178 Bates R. C. et al. 2003 Current Biology 13 1721 1727 Lu Z. et al. 2003 Cancer Cell. 4 6 499 515 . Epithelial cells which are bound together tightly and exhibit polarity give rise to mesenchymal cells which are held together more loosely exhibit a loss of polarity and have the ability to travel. These mesenchymal cells can spread into tissues surrounding the original tumor as well as separate from the tumor invade blood and lymph vessels and travel to new locations where they divide and form additional tumors. EMT does not occur in healthy cells except during embryogenesis. Under normal circumstances TGF acts as a growth inhibitor. However it is believed that during cancer metastasis TGF begins to promote EMT.

Thus there remains a critical need for improved methods for determining the best mode of treatment for any given cancer patient and for the incorporation of such determinations into more effective treatment regimens for cancer patients whether such inhibitors are used as single agents or combined with other anti cancer agents.

The present invention provides diagnostic and prognostic methods for predicting the effectiveness of treatment of a cancer patient with an EGFR kinase inhibitor. Based on the surprising discovery that the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors is dependent on whether such tumor cells have undergone an EMT methods have been devised for determining epithelial and or mesenchymal biomarkers to predict the sensitivity of tumor cells to EGFR kinase inhibitors.

Accordingly the present invention provides a method of predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor comprising assessing the level of an epithelial biomarker expressed by a tumor cell and predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor wherein high expression levels of tumor cell epithelial biomarkers correlate with high sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors.

The present invention also provides a method of predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor comprising assessing the level of a mesenchymal biomarker expressed by a tumor cell and predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor wherein high expression levels of tumor cell mesenchymal biomarkers correlate with low sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors.

Improved methods for treating cancer patients with EGFR kinase inhibitors that incorporate the above methodology are also provided. Thus the present invention further provides a method for treating tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising the steps of diagnosing a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor by assessing whether the tumor cells have undergone an epithelial mesenchymal transition and administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor.

Additionally methods are provided for the identification of new epithelial or mesenchymal biomarkers that are predictive of responsiveness of tumors to EGFR kinase inhibitors.

Thus for example the present invention further provides a method of identifying an epithelial biomarker that is diagnostic for more effective treatment of a neoplastic condition with an EGFR kinase inhibitor comprising measuring the level of a candidate epithelial biomarker in neoplastic cell containing samples from patients with a neoplastic condition and identifying a correlation between the level of said candidate epithelial biomarker in the sample from the patient with the effectiveness of treatment of the neoplastic condition with an EGFR kinase inhibitor wherein a correlation of high levels of the epithelial biomarker with more effective treatment of the neoplastic condition with an EGFR kinase inhibitor indicates that said epithelial biomarker is diagnostic for more effective treatment of the neoplastic condition with an EGFR kinase inhibitor.

The present invention further provides a method of identifying a mesenchymal biomarker that is diagnostic for less effective treatment of a neoplastic condition with an EGFR kinase inhibitor comprising a measuring the level of a candidate mesenchymal biomarker in neoplastic cell containing samples from patients with a neoplastic condition and b identifying a correlation between the level of said candidate mesenchymal biomarker in the sample from the patient with the effectiveness of treatment of the neoplastic condition with an EGFR kinase inhibitor wherein a correlation of high levels of the mesenchymal biomarker with less effective treatment of the neoplastic condition with an EGFR kinase inhibitor indicates that said mesenchymal biomarker is diagnostic for less effective treatment of the neoplastic condition with an EGFR kinase inhibitor.

Furthermore methods for the identification of agents that restore the sensitivity of tumor cells that have undergone EMT to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors are also provided. Thus for example the present invention provides a method for the identification of an agent that enhances sensitivity of the growth of a tumor cell to an EGFR kinase inhibitor said tumor cell having being characterized as one that has previously undergone an epithelial mesenchymal transition comprising contacting a sample of said tumor cells with an EGFR kinase inhibitor contacting an identical sample of said tumor cells with an EGFR kinase inhibitor in the presence of a test agent comparing the EGFR kinase inhibitor mediated growth inhibition in the presence and absence of the test agent and determining whether the test agent is an agent that enhances sensitivity of the growth of the tumor cell to an EGFR kinase inhibitor.

The term cancer in an animal refers to the presence of cells possessing characteristics typical of cancer causing cells such as uncontrolled proliferation immortality metastatic potential rapid growth and proliferation rate and certain characteristic morphological features. Often cancer cells will be in the form of a tumor but such cells may exist alone within an animal or may circulate in the blood stream as independent cells such as leukemic cells.

 Abnormal cell growth as used herein unless otherwise indicated refers to cell growth that is independent of normal regulatory mechanisms e.g. loss of contact inhibition . This includes the abnormal growth of 1 tumor cells tumors that proliferate by expressing a mutated tyrosine kinase or overexpression of a receptor tyrosine kinase 2 benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant tyrosine kinase activation occurs 4 any tumors that proliferate by receptor tyrosine kinases 5 any tumors that proliferate by aberrant serine threonine kinase activation and 6 benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant serine threonine kinase activation occurs.

The term treating as used herein unless otherwise indicated means reversing alleviating inhibiting the progress of or preventing either partially or completely the growth of tumors tumor metastases or other cancer causing or neoplastic cells in a patient. The term treatment as used herein unless otherwise indicated refers to the act of treating.

The phrase a method of treating or its equivalent when applied to for example cancer refers to a procedure or course of action that is designed to reduce or eliminate the number of cancer cells in an animal or to alleviate the symptoms of a cancer. A method of treating cancer or another proliferative disorder does not necessarily mean that the cancer cells or other disorder will in fact be eliminated that the number of cells or disorder will in fact be reduced or that the symptoms of a cancer or other disorder will in fact be alleviated. Often a method of treating cancer will be performed even with a low likelihood of success but which given the medical history and estimated survival expectancy of an animal is nevertheless deemed an overall beneficial course of action.

The term therapeutically effective agent means a composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue system animal or human that is being sought by the researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician.

The term therapeutically effective amount or effective amount means the amount of the subject compound or combination that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue system animal or human that is being sought by the researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician.

The data presented in the Examples herein below demonstrate that tumor cells such as NSCLC or pancreatic cancer cells containing wild type EGFR grown either in cell culture or in vivo show a range of sensitivities to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors dependent on whether they have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition EMT . Prior to EMT tumor cells are very sensitive to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib HCl TARCEVA whereas tumor cells which have undergone an EMT are substantially less sensitive to inhibition by such compounds. The data indicates that the EMT may be a general biological switch that determines the level of sensitivity of tumors to EGFR kinase inhibitors. It is demonstrated that the level of sensitivity of tumors to EGFR kinase inhibitors can be assessed by determining the level of biomarkers expressed by a tumor cell that are characteristic for cells either prior to or subsequent to an EMT event. For example high levels of tumor cell expression of epithelial biomarkers such as E cadherin indicative of a cell that has not yet undergone an EMT correlate with high sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors. Conversely high levels of tumor cell expression of mesenchymal biomarkers such as vimentin or fibronectin indicative of a cell that has undergone an EMT correlate with low sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors. Thus these observations can form the basis of valuable new diagnostic methods for predicting the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors on tumor growth and give oncologists an additional tool to assist them in choosing the most appropriate treatment for their patients.

Accordingly the present invention provides a method of predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor comprising assessing the level of an epithelial biomarker expressed by a tumor cell and predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor wherein high expression levels of tumor cell epithelial biomarkers correlate with high sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors. Preferred examples of epithelial biomarkers include E cadherin and Brk i.e. PTK 6 see Table 1 . Additional examples of epithelial biomarkers that can be utilized in the method of this invention include catenin i.e. junction plakoglobin catenin i.e. 1 2 or 3 catenin keratin 8 keratin 18 connexin 31 plakophilin 3 stratafin 1 laminin alpha 5 and ST14 see Table 1 .

The present invention also provides a method of predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor comprising assessing the level of a mesenchymal biomarker expressed by a tumor cell and predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor wherein high expression levels of tumor cell mesenchymal biomarkers correlate with low sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors. Preferred examples of mesenchymal biomarkers include vimentin and fibronectin see Table 1 . Additional examples of mesenchymal biomarkers that can be utilized in the method of this invention include fibrillin 1 fibrillin 2 collagen alpha 2 IV collagen alpha 2 V LOXL1 nidogen C11orf9 tenascin N cadherin and embryonal EDB fibronectin tubulin alpha 3 and epimorphin see Table 1 .

In the practice of this invention with preferred epithelial biomarkers the level of expression in tumor cells that are sensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors will generally be at such a high level that the biomarker will be very readily detectable using for example a specific anti biomarker antibody for detection. With preferred epithelial biomarkers the level of expression in tumor cells that are relatively insensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors will generally be at such a low level that the biomarker will be barely detectable if at all using similar procedures e.g. in the data presented in the Examples herein below compare E cadherin levels between sensitive and relatively insensitive tumor cells in and .

However for other less preferred epithelial biomarkers the level of biomarker expression in tumor cells that are relatively insensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors may be readily detectable but nevertheless will be at a substantially lower level of expression than in tumor cells that are sensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors e.g. in the data presented in the Examples herein below compare catenin levels for the relatively insensitive tumor cells H1703 or SW1573 with the sensitive tumor cells H441 H358 H322 and H292 in .

Similarly in the practice of this invention with preferred mesenchymal biomarkers the level of expression in tumor cells that are relatively insensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors will generally be at such a high level that the biomarker will be very readily detectable using for example a specific anti biomarker antibody for detection. With preferred mesenchymal biomarkers the level of expression in tumor cells that are relatively sensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors will generally be at such a low level that the biomarker will be barely detectable if at all using similar procedures e.g. in the data presented in the Examples herein below compare fibronectin or vimentin levels between sensitive and relatively insensitive tumor cells in and .

Also for other less preferred mesenchymal biomarkers the level of biomarker expression in tumor cells that are relatively sensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors may be readily detectable but nevertheless will be at a substantially lower level of expression than in tumor cells that are relatively insensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors.

For any given epithelial or mesenchymal biomarker the range of expression level between tumor cells that are relatively insensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors and those that are sensitive can readily be assessed by one of skill in the art for example by testing on a panel of tumor cells as described herein e.g. or by testing in tumor biopsies from patients whose tumors display a range of sensitivities to an EGFR kinase inhibitor e.g. TARCEVA .

In the context of this invention for a relatively small percentage of tumor cells that are relatively insensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors the methods described above for predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor comprising assessing the level of an epithelial or mesenchymal biomarker expressed by a tumor cell in circumstances where only a single biomarker level is assessed may falsely predict that tumor cell growth is sensitive to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor. For example in the data presented in the Examples herein below the levels of the epithelial biomarkers catenin and catenin in H460 tumor cells or the mesenchymal biomarker fibronectin in H1703 cells falsely predict high sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors see . Thus based on such false predictions a physician may be lead to treat a small number of patients with EGFR kinase inhibitors and the tumor may not be sensitive to the inhibitor. However for the vast majority of tumor cells e.g. at least 90 from the data presented in the Examples herein below assessment of a single biomarker expression level would be expected to provide an accurate prediction of level of sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors.

Furthermore most importantly in the context of this invention no tumor cells that are sensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors have been found that when tested by the above methods where only a single biomarker level is assessed give a false prediction that tumor cell growth will be insensitive to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor. Thus utilizing the testing methods described herein should never lead a physician to withhold treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor in cases where the patient may benefit from such treatment.

In addition one of skill in the medical arts particularly pertaining to the application of diagnostic tests and treatment with therapeutics will recognize that biological systems are somewhat variable and not always entirely predictable and thus many good diagnostic tests or therapeutics are occasionally ineffective. Thus it is ultimately up to the judgement of the attending physician to determine the most appropriate course of treatment for an individual patient based upon test results patient condition and history and his own experience. There may even be occasions for example when a physician will choose to treat a patient with an EGFR kinase inhibitor even when a tumor is not predicted to be particularly sensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors based on data from diagnostic tests or from other criteria particularly if all or most of the other obvious treatment options have failed or if some synergy is anticipated when given with another treatment. The fact that the EGFR kinase inhibitors as a class of drugs are relatively well tolerated compared to many other anti cancer drugs such as more traditional chemotherapy or cytotoxic agents used in the treatment of cancer makes this a more viable option.

Preferred examples of suitable epithelial biomarkers for use in this invention such as E cadherin do not lead to any false predictions when used in the methods described above where only a single biomarker level is assessed .

Furthermore this invention also provides additional methods wherein simultaneous assessment of the expression level in tumor cells of more than one biomarker level is utilized. In preferred embodiments of these methods described below there is no level of false prediction as is the case for some of the methods described above where a single biomarker expression level is assessed.

Accordingly the present invention provides a method of predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor comprising assessing the level of one or more or a panel of epithelial biomarkers expressed by a tumor cell and predicting the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor wherein simultaneous high expression levels of all of the tumor cell epithelial biomarkers correlates with high sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors.

In a preferred embodiment the biomarker is an individual marker protein or its encoding mRNA characteristic of the particular transition state of the tumor i.e. a tumor exhibiting epithelial or mesenchymal characteristics. In an alternative embodiment in certain circumstances the biomarker may be a characteristic morphological pattern produced in the tumor cell by cellular macromolecules that is characteristic of either an epithelial or mesenchymal condition.

Table 1 lists the genes coding for examples of molecular biomarkers that can be used in the practice of the methods of the invention described herein. The molecular biomarkers can include any product expressed by these genes including variants thereof e.g. expressed mRNA or protein splice variants co and post translationally modified proteins polymorphic variants etc. In one embodiment the biomarker is the embryonal EDB fibronectin a splice variant expressed by the fibronectin 1 gene Kilian O. et al. 2004 Bone 35 6 1334 1345 . A possible advantage of determining this fetal form of fibronectin is that one could readily distinguish mesenchymal like tumors from surrounding stromal tissue. In an additional embodiment the biomarker can be an animal homologue of the human gene product e.g. from dog mouse rat rabbit cat monkey ape etc. .

In one embodiment of this method the EGFR kinase inhibitor comprises erlotinib.

The present invention also provides a method for treating tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising the steps of diagnosing a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor by using any of the methods described herein to predict the sensitivity of tumor cell growth to inhibition by an EGFR kinase inhibitor identifying the patient as one who is likely to demonstrate an effective response to treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor and administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor. In one embodiment the EGFR kinase inhibitor comprises erlotinib.

In the methods described herein the tumor cell will typically be from a patient diagnosed with cancer a precancerous condition or another form of abnormal cell growth and in need of treatment. The cancer may be lung cancer e.g. non small cell lung cancer NSCLC pancreatic cancer head and neck cancer gastric cancer breast cancer colon cancer ovarian cancer or any of a variety of other cancers described herein below. The cancer is preferably one known to be potentially treatable with an EGFR kinase inhibitor.

In the methods of this invention biomarker expression level can be assessed relative to a control molecule whose expression level remains constant throughout EMT or when comparing tumor cells expressing either epithelial or mesenchymal transition states as indicated by molecular biomarkers e.g. a housekeeping gene such as GAPDH actin tubulin or the like . Biomarker expression level can also be assessed relative to the other type of tumor cell biomarker i.e. epithelial compared to mesenchymal or to the biomarker level in non tumor cells of the same tissue or another cell or tissue source used as an assay reference.

In the methods of this invention the level of an epithelial or mesenchymal biomarker expressed by a tumor cell can be assessed by using any of the standard bioassay procedures known in the art for determination of the level of expression of a gene including for example ELISA RIA immunopreciptation immunoblotting immunofluorescence microscopy immunohistochemistry IHC RT PCR in situ hybridization cDNA microarray or the like as described in more detail below.

In the methods of this invention the expression level of a tumor cell epithelial or mesenchymal biomarker is preferably assessed by assaying a tumor biopsy. However in an alternative embodiment expression level of the tumor cell biomarker can be assessed in bodily fluids or excretions containing detectable levels of biomarkers originating from the tumor or tumor cells. Bodily fluids or excretions useful in the present invention include blood urine saliva stool pleural fluid lymphatic fluid sputum ascites prostatic fluid cerebrospinal fluid CSF or any other bodily secretion or derivative thereof. By blood it is meant to include whole blood plasma serum or any derivative of blood. Assessment of tumor epithelial or mesenchymal biomarkers in such bodily fluids or excretions can sometimes be preferred in circumstances where an invasive sampling method is inappropriate or inconvenient.

In the methods of this invention the tumor cell can be a lung cancer tumor cell e.g. non small cell lung cancer NSCLC a pancreatic cancer tumor cell a breast cancer tumor cell a head and neck cancer tumor cell a gastric cancer tumor cell a colon cancer tumor cell an ovarian cancer tumor cell or a tumor cell from any of a variety of other cancers as described herein below. The tumor cell is preferably of a type known to or expected to express EGFR kinase as do all tumor cells from solid tumors. The EGFR kinase can be wild type or a mutant form.

For assessment of tumor cell epithelial or mesenchymal biomarker expression patient samples containing tumor cells or proteins or nucleic acids produced by these tumor cells may be used in the methods of the present invention. In these embodiments the level of expression of the biomarker can be assessed by assessing the amount e.g. absolute amount or concentration of the marker in a tumor cell sample e.g. a tumor biopsy obtained from a patient or other patient sample containing material derived from the tumor e.g. blood serum urine or other bodily fluids or excretions as described herein above . The cell sample can of course be subjected to a variety of well known post collection preparative and storage techniques e.g. nucleic acid and or protein extraction fixation storage freezing ultrafiltration concentration evaporation centrifugation etc. prior to assessing the amount of the marker in the sample. Likewise tumor biopsies may also be subjected to post collection preparative and storage techniques e.g. fixation.

In the methods of the invention one can detect expression of biomarker proteins having at least one portion which is displayed on the surface of tumor cells which express it. It is a simple matter for the skilled artisan to determine whether a marker protein or a portion thereof is exposed on the cell surface. For example immunological methods may be used to detect such proteins on whole cells or well known computer based sequence analysis methods may be used to predict the presence of at least one extracellular domain i.e. including both secreted proteins and proteins having at least one cell surface domain . Expression of a marker protein having at least one portion which is displayed on the surface of a cell which expresses it may be detected without necessarily lysing the tumor cell e.g. using a labeled antibody which binds specifically with a cell surface domain of the protein .

Expression of a biomarkers described in this invention may be assessed by any of a wide variety of well known methods for detecting expression of a transcribed nucleic acid or protein. Non limiting examples of such methods include immunological methods for detection of secreted cell surface cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins protein purification methods protein function or activity assays nucleic acid hybridization methods nucleic acid reverse transcription methods and nucleic acid amplification methods.

In one embodiment expression of a biomarker is assessed using an antibody e.g. a radio labeled chromophore labeled fluorophore labeled or enzyme labeled antibody an antibody derivative e.g. an antibody conjugated with a substrate or with the protein or ligand of a protein ligand pair e.g. biotin streptavidin or an antibody fragment e.g. a single chain antibody an isolated antibody hypervariable domain etc. which binds specifically with a biomarker protein or fragment thereof including a biomarker protein which has undergone either all or a portion of post translational modifications to which it is normally subjected in the tumor cell e.g. glycosylation phosphorylation methylation etc. .

In another embodiment expression of a biomarker is assessed by preparing mRNA cDNA i.e. a transcribed polynucleotide from cells in a patient sample and by hybridizing the mRNA cDNA with a reference polynucleotide which is a complement of a biomarker nucleic acid or a fragment thereof. cDNA can optionally be amplified using any of a variety of polymerase chain reaction methods prior to hybridization with the reference polynucleotide. Expression of one or more biomarkers can likewise be detected using quantitative PCR to assess the level of expression of the biomarker s . Alternatively any of the many known methods of detecting mutations or variants e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms deletions etc. of a biomarker of the invention may be used to detect occurrence of a biomarker in a patient.

In a related embodiment a mixture of transcribed polynucleotides obtained from the sample is contacted with a substrate having fixed thereto a polynucleotide complementary to or homologous with at least a portion e.g. at least 7 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 100 500 or more nucleotide residues of a biomarker nucleic acid. If polynucleotides complementary to or homologous with are differentially detectable on the substrate e.g. detectable using different chromophores or fluorophores or fixed to different selected positions then the levels of expression of a plurality of biomarkers can be assessed simultaneously using a single substrate e.g. a gene chip microarray of polynucleotides fixed at selected positions . When a method of assessing biomarker expression is used which involves hybridization of one nucleic acid with another it is preferred that the hybridization be performed under stringent hybridization conditions.

When a plurality of biomarkers of the invention are used in the methods of the invention the level of expression of each biomarker in a patient sample can be compared with the normal level of expression of each of the plurality of biomarkers in non cancerous samples of the same type either in a single reaction mixture i.e. using reagents such as different fluorescent probes for each biomarker or in individual reaction mixtures corresponding to one or more of the biomarkers.

The level of expression of a biomarker in normal i.e. non cancerous human tissue can be assessed in a variety of ways. In one embodiment this normal level of expression is assessed by assessing the level of expression of the biomarker in a portion of cells which appears to be non cancerous and then comparing this normal level of expression with the level of expression in a portion of the tumor cells. Alternately and particularly as further information becomes available as a result of routine performance of the methods described herein population average values for normal expression of the biomarkers of the invention may be used. In other embodiments the normal level of expression of a biomarker may be determined by assessing expression of the biomarker in a patient sample obtained from a non cancer afflicted patient from a patient sample obtained from a patient before the suspected onset of cancer in the patient from archived patient samples and the like.

An exemplary method for detecting the presence or absence of a biomarker protein or nucleic acid in a biological sample involves obtaining a biological sample e.g. a tumor associated body fluid from a test subject and contacting the biological sample with a compound or an agent capable of detecting the polypeptide or nucleic acid e.g. mRNA genomic DNA or cDNA . The detection methods of the invention can thus be used to detect mRNA protein cDNA or genomic DNA for example in a biological sample in vitro as well as in vivo. For example in vitro techniques for detection of mRNA include Northern hybridizations and in situ hybridizations. In vitro techniques for detection of a biomarker protein include enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISAs Western blots immunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence. In vitro techniques for detection of genomic DNA include Southern hybridizations. In vivo techniques for detection of mRNA include polymerase chain reaction PCR Northern hybridizations and in situ hybridizations. Furthermore in vivo techniques for detection of a biomarker protein include introducing into a subject a labeled antibody directed against the protein or fragment thereof. For example the antibody can be labeled with a radioactive marker whose presence and location in a subject can be detected by standard imaging techniques.

A general principle of such diagnostic and prognostic assays involves preparing a sample or reaction mixture that may contain a biomarker and a probe under appropriate conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the biomarker and probe to interact and bind thus forming a complex that can be removed and or detected in the reaction mixture. These assays can be conducted in a variety of ways.

For example one method to conduct such an assay would involve anchoring the biomarker or probe onto a solid phase support also referred to as a substrate and detecting target biomarker probe complexes anchored on the solid phase at the end of the reaction. In one embodiment of such a method a sample from a subject which is to be assayed for presence and or concentration of biomarker can be anchored onto a carrier or solid phase support. In another embodiment the reverse situation is possible in which the probe can be anchored to a solid phase and a sample from a subject can be allowed to react as an unanchored component of the assay.

There are many established methods for anchoring assay components to a solid phase. These include without limitation biomarker or probe molecules which are immobilized through conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Such biotinylated assay components can be prepared from biotin NHS N hydroxy succinimide using techniques known in the art e.g. biotinylation kit Pierce Chemicals Rockford Ill. and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin coated 96 well plates Pierce Chemical . In certain embodiments the surfaces with immobilized assay components can be prepared in advance and stored.

Other suitable carriers or solid phase supports for such assays include any material capable of binding the class of molecule to which the biomarker or probe belongs. Well known supports or carriers include but are not limited to glass polystyrene nylon polypropylene nylon polyethylene dextran amylases natural and modified celluloses polyacrylamides gabbros and magnetite.

In order to conduct assays with the above mentioned approaches the non immobilized component is added to the solid phase upon which the second component is anchored. After the reaction is complete uncomplexed components may be removed e.g. by washing under conditions such that any complexes formed will remain immobilized upon the solid phase. The detection of biomarker probe complexes anchored to the solid phase can be accomplished in a number of methods outlined herein.

In one embodiment the probe when it is the unanchored assay component can be labeled for the purpose of detection and readout of the assay either directly or indirectly with detectable labels discussed herein and which are well known to one skilled in the art.

It is also possible to directly detect biomarker probe complex formation without further manipulation or labeling of either component biomarker or probe for example by utilizing the technique of fluorescence energy transfer i.e. FET see for example Lakowicz et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 631 169 Stavrianopoulos et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 868 103 . A fluorophore label on the first donor molecule is selected such that upon excitation with incident light of appropriate wavelength its emitted fluorescent energy will be absorbed by a fluorescent label on a second acceptor molecule which in turn is able to fluoresce due to the absorbed energy. Alternately the donor protein molecule may simply utilize the natural fluorescent energy of tryptophan residues. Labels are chosen that emit different wavelengths of light such that the acceptor molecule label may be differentiated from that of the donor . Since the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules spatial relationships between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in which binding occurs between the molecules the fluorescent emission of the acceptor molecule label in the assay should be maximal. An FET binding event can be conveniently measured through standard fluorometric detection means well known in the art e.g. using a fluorimeter .

In another embodiment determination of the ability of a probe to recognize a biomarker can be accomplished without labeling either assay component probe or biomarker by utilizing a technology such as real time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis BIA see e.g. Sjolander S. and Urbaniczky C. 1991 Anal. Chem. 63 2338 2345 and Szabo et al. 1995 Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 5 699 705 . As used herein BIA or surface plasmon resonance is a technology for studying biospecific interactions in real time without labeling any of the interactants e.g. BIAcore . Changes in the mass at the binding surface indicative of a binding event result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance SPR resulting in a detectable signal which can be used as an indication of real time reactions between biological molecules.

Alternatively in another embodiment analogous diagnostic and prognostic assays can be conducted with biomarker and probe as solutes in a liquid phase. In such an assay the complexed biomarker and probe are separated from uncomplexed components by any of a number of standard techniques including but not limited to differential centrifugation chromatography electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation. In differential centrifugation biomarker probe complexes may be separated from uncomplexed assay components through a series of centrifugal steps due to the different sedimentation equilibria of complexes based on their different sizes and densities see for example Rivas G. and Minton A. P. 1993 Trends Biochem Sci. 18 8 284 7 . Standard chromatographic techniques may also be utilized to separate complexed molecules from uncomplexed ones. For example gel filtration chromatography separates molecules based on size and through the utilization of an appropriate gel filtration resin in a column format for example the relatively larger complex may be separated from the relatively smaller uncomplexed components. Similarly the relatively different charge properties of the biomarker probe complex as compared to the uncomplexed components may be exploited to differentiate the complex from uncomplexed components for example through the utilization of ion exchange chromatography resins. Such resins and chromatographic techniques are well known to one skilled in the art see e.g. Heegaard N. H. 1998 J. Mol. Recognit. Winter 11 1 6 141 8 Hage D. S. and Tweed S. A. J. Chromatogr B Biomed Sci Appl 1997 Oct. 10 699 1 2 499 525 . Gel electrophoresis may also be employed to separate complexed assay components from unbound components see e.g. Ausubel et al. ed. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons New York 1987 1999 . In this technique protein or nucleic acid complexes are separated based on size or charge for example. In order to maintain the binding interaction during the electrophoretic process non denaturing gel matrix materials and conditions in the absence of reducing agent are typically preferred. Appropriate conditions to the particular assay and components thereof will be well known to one skilled in the art.

In a particular embodiment the level of biomarker mRNA can be determined both by in situ and by in vitro formats in a biological sample using methods known in the art. The term biological sample is intended to include tissues cells biological fluids and isolates thereof isolated from a subject as well as tissues cells and fluids present within a subject. Many expression detection methods use isolated RNA. For in vitro methods any RNA isolation technique that does not select against the isolation of mRNA can be utilized for the purification of RNA from tumor cells see e.g. Ausubel et al. ed. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons New York 1987 1999 . Additionally large numbers of tissue samples can readily be processed using techniques well known to those of skill in the art such as for example the single step RNA isolation process of Chomczynski 1989 U.S. Pat. No. 4 843 155 .

The isolated mRNA can be used in hybridization or amplification assays that include but are not limited to Southern or Northern analyses polymerase chain reaction analyses and probe arrays. One preferred diagnostic method for the detection of mRNA levels involves contacting the isolated mRNA with a nucleic acid molecule probe that can hybridize to the mRNA encoded by the gene being detected. The nucleic acid probe can be for example a full length cDNA or a portion thereof such as an oligonucleotide of at least 7 15 30 50 100 250 or 500 nucleotides in length and sufficient to specifically hybridize under stringent conditions to a mRNA or genomic DNA encoding a biomarker of the present invention. Other suitable probes for use in the diagnostic assays of the invention are described herein. Hybridization of an mRNA with the probe indicates that the biomarker in question is being expressed.

In one format the mRNA is immobilized on a solid surface and contacted with a probe for example by running the isolated mRNA on an agarose gel and transferring the mRNA from the gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose. In an alternative format the probe s are immobilized on a solid surface and the mRNA is contacted with the probe s for example in an Affymetrix gene chip array. A skilled artisan can readily adapt known mRNA detection methods for use in detecting the level of mRNA encoded by the biomarkers of the present invention.

An alternative method for determining the level of mRNA biomarker in a sample involves the process of nucleic acid amplification e.g. by RT PCR the experimental embodiment set forth in Mullis 1987 U.S. Pat. No. 4 683 202 ligase chain reaction Barany 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 189 193 self sustained sequence replication Guatelli et al. 1990 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 1874 1878 transcriptional amplification system Kwoh et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 1173 1177 Q Beta Replicase Lizardi et al. 1988 Bio Technology 6 1197 rolling circle replication Lizardi et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 854 033 or any other nucleic acid amplification method followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These detection schemes are especially useful for the detection of nucleic acid molecules if such molecules are present in very low numbers. As used herein amplification primers are defined as being a pair of nucleic acid molecules that can anneal to 5 or 3 regions of a gene plus and minus strands respectively or vice versa and contain a short region in between. In general amplification primers are from about 10 to 30 nucleotides in length and flank a region from about 50 to 200 nucleotides in length. Under appropriate conditions and with appropriate reagents such primers permit the amplification of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence flanked by the primers.

For in situ methods mRNA does not need to be isolated from the tumor cells prior to detection. In such methods a cell or tissue sample is prepared processed using known histological methods. The sample is then immobilized on a support typically a glass slide and then contacted with a probe that can hybridize to mRNA that encodes the biomarker.

As an alternative to making determinations based on the absolute expression level of the biomarker determinations may be based on the normalized expression level of the biomarker. Expression levels are normalized by correcting the absolute expression level of a biomarker by comparing its expression to the expression of a gene that is not a biomarker e.g. a housekeeping gene that is constitutively expressed. Suitable genes for normalization include housekeeping genes such as the actin gene or epithelial cell specific genes. This normalization allows the comparison of the expression level in one sample e.g. a patient sample to another sample e.g. a non tumor sample or between samples from different sources.

Alternatively the expression level can be provided as a relative expression level. To determine a relative expression level of a biomarker e.g. a mesenchymal biomarker the level of expression of the biomarker is determined for 10 or more samples of normal versus cancer cell isolates preferably 50 or more samples prior to the determination of the expression level for the sample in question. The mean expression level of each of the genes assayed in the larger number of samples is determined and this is used as a baseline expression level for the biomarker. The expression level of the biomarker determined for the test sample absolute level of expression is then divided by the mean expression value obtained for that biomarker. This provides a relative expression level.

In another embodiment of the present invention a biomarker protein is detected. A preferred agent for detecting biomarker protein of the invention is an antibody capable of binding to such a protein or a fragment thereof preferably an antibody with a detectable label. Antibodies can be polyclonal or more preferably monoclonal. An intact antibody or a fragment or derivative thereof e.g. Fab or F ab .sub.2 can be used. The term labeled with regard to the probe or antibody is intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by coupling i.e. physically linking a detectable substance to the probe or antibody as well as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with another reagent that is directly labeled. Examples of indirect labeling include detection of a primary antibody using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and end labeling of a DNA probe with biotin such that it can be detected with fluorescently labeled streptavidin.

Proteins from tumor cells can be isolated using techniques that are well known to those of skill in the art. The protein isolation methods employed can for example be such as those described in Harlow and Lane Harlow and Lane 1988 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. .

A variety of formats can be employed to determine whether a sample contains a protein that binds to a given antibody. Examples of such formats include but are not limited to enzyme immunoassay EIA radioimmunoassay RIA Western blot analysis and enzyme linked immunoabsorbant assay ELISA . A skilled artisan can readily adapt known protein antibody detection methods for use in determining whether tumor cells express a biomarker of the present invention.

In one format antibodies or antibody fragments or derivatives can be used in methods such as Western blots or immunofluorescence techniques to detect the expressed proteins. In such uses it is generally preferable to immobilize either the antibody or proteins on a solid support. Suitable solid phase supports or carriers include any support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well known supports or carriers include glass polystyrene polypropylene polyethylene dextran nylon amylases natural and modified celluloses polyacrylamides gabbros and magnetite.

One skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or antigen and will be able to adapt such support for use with the present invention. For example protein isolated from tumor cells can be run on a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immobilized onto a solid phase support such as nitrocellulose. The support can then be washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled antibody. The solid phase support can then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody. The amount of bound label on the solid support can then be detected by conventional means.

For ELISA assays specific binding pairs can be of the immune or non immune type. Immune specific binding pairs are exemplified by antigen antibody systems or hapten anti hapten systems. There can be mentioned fluorescein anti fluorescein dinitrophenyl anti dinitrophenyl biotin anti biotin peptide anti peptide and the like. The antibody member of the specific binding pair can be produced by customary methods familiar to those skilled in the art. Such methods involve immunizing an animal with the antigen member of the specific binding pair. If the antigen member of the specific binding pair is not immunogenic e.g. a hapten it can be covalently coupled to a carrier protein to render it immunogenic. Non immune binding pairs include systems wherein the two components share a natural affinity for each other but are not antibodies. Exemplary non immune pairs are biotin streptavidin intrinsic factor vitamin B folic acid folate binding protein and the like.

A variety of methods are available to covalently label antibodies with members of specific binding pairs. Methods are selected based upon the nature of the member of the specific binding pair the type of linkage desired and the tolerance of the antibody to various conjugation chemistries. Biotin can be covalently coupled to antibodies by utilizing commercially available active derivatives. Some of these are biotin N hydroxy succinimide which binds to amine groups on proteins biotin hydrazide which binds to carbohydrate moieties aldehydes and carboxyl groups via a carbodiimide coupling and biotin maleimide and iodoacetyl biotin which bind to sulfhydryl groups. Fluorescein can be coupled to protein amine groups using fluorescein isothiocyanate. Dinitrophenyl groups can be coupled to protein amine groups using 2 4 dinitrobenzene sulfate or 2 4 dinitrofluorobenzene. Other standard methods of conjugation can be employed to couple monoclonal antibodies to a member of a specific binding pair including dialdehyde carbodiimide coupling homofunctional crosslinking and heterobifunctional crosslinking. Carbodiimide coupling is an effective method of coupling carboxyl groups on one substance to amine groups on another. Carbodiimide coupling is facilitated by using the commercially available reagent 1 ethyl 3 dimethyl aminopropyl carbodiimide EDAC .

Homobifunctional crosslinkers including the bifunctional imidoesters and bifunctional N hydroxysuccinimide esters are commercially available and are employed for coupling amine groups on one substance to amine groups on another. Heterobifunctional crosslinkers are reagents which possess different functional groups. The most common commercially available heterobifunctional crosslinkers have an amine reactive N hydroxysuccinimide ester as one functional group and a sulfhydryl reactive group as the second functional group. The most common sulfhydryl reactive groups are maleimides pyridyl disulfides and active halogens. One of the functional groups can be a photoactive aryl nitrene which upon irradiation reacts with a variety of groups.

The detectably labeled antibody or detectably labeled member of the specific binding pair is prepared by coupling to a reporter which can be a radioactive isotope enzyme fluorogenic chemiluminescent or electrochemical materials. Two commonly used radioactive isotopes are I and H. Standard radioactive isotopic labeling procedures include the chloramine T lactoperoxidase and Bolton Hunter methods for I and reductive methylation for H. The term detectably labeled refers to a molecule labeled in such a way that it can be readily detected by the intrinsic enzymic activity of the label or by the binding to the label of another component which can itself be readily detected.

Enzymes suitable for use in this invention include but are not limited to horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase galactosidase glucose oxidase luciferases including firefly and renilla lactamase urease green fluorescent protein GFP and lysozyme. Enzyme labeling is facilitated by using dialdehyde carbodiimide coupling homobifunctional crosslinkers and heterobifunctional crosslinkers as described above for coupling an antibody with a member of a specific binding pair.

The labeling method chosen depends on the functional groups available on the enzyme and the material to be labeled and the tolerance of both to the conjugation conditions. The labeling method used in the present invention can be one of but not limited to any conventional methods currently employed including those described by Engvall and Pearlmann Immunochemistry 8 871 1971 Avrameas and Ternynck Immunochemistry 8 1175 1975 Ishikawa et al. J. Immunoassay 4 3 209 327 1983 and Jablonski Anal. Biochem. 148 199 1985 .

Labeling can be accomplished by indirect methods such as using spacers or other members of specific binding pairs. An example of this is the detection of a biotinylated antibody with unlabeled streptavidin and biotinylated enzyme with streptavidin and biotinylated enzyme being added either sequentially or simultaneously. Thus according to the present invention the antibody used to detect can be detectably labeled directly with a reporter or indirectly with a first member of a specific binding pair. When the antibody is coupled to a first member of a specific binding pair then detection is effected by reacting the antibody first member of a specific binding complex with the second member of the binding pair that is labeled or unlabeled as mentioned above.

Moreover the unlabeled detector antibody can be detected by reacting the unlabeled antibody with a labeled antibody specific for the unlabeled antibody. In this instance detectably labeled as used above is taken to mean containing an epitope by which an antibody specific for the unlabeled antibody can bind. Such an anti antibody can be labeled directly or indirectly using any of the approaches discussed above. For example the anti antibody can be coupled to biotin which is detected by reacting with the streptavidin horseradish peroxidase system discussed above.

In one embodiment of this invention biotin is utilized. The biotinylated antibody is in turn reacted with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase complex. Orthophenylenediamine 4 chloro naphthol tetramethylbenzidine TMB ABTS BTS or ASA can be used to effect chromogenic detection.

In one immunoassay format for practicing this invention a forward sandwich assay is used in which the capture reagent has been immobilized using conventional techniques on the surface of a support. Suitable supports used in assays include synthetic polymer supports such as polypropylene polystyrene substituted polystyrene e.g. aminated or carboxylated polystyrene polyacrylamides polyamides polyvinylchloride glass beads agarose or nitrocellulose.

The invention also encompasses kits for detecting the presence of a biomarker protein or nucleic acid in a biological sample. Such kits can be used to determine if a subject is suffering from or is at increased risk of developing a tumor that is less susceptible to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors. For example the kit can comprise a labeled compound or agent capable of detecting a biomarker protein or nucleic acid in a biological sample and means for determining the amount of the protein or mRNA in the sample e.g. an antibody which binds the protein or a fragment thereof or an oligonucleotide probe which binds to DNA or mRNA encoding the protein . Kits can also include instructions for interpreting the results obtained using the kit.

For antibody based kits the kit can comprise for example 1 a first antibody e.g. attached to a solid support which binds to a biomarker protein and optionally 2 a second different antibody which binds to either the protein or the first antibody and is conjugated to a detectable label.

For oligonucleotide based kits the kit can comprise for example 1 an oligonucleotide e.g. a detectably labeled oligonucleotide which hybridizes to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a biomarker protein or 2 a pair of primers useful for amplifying a biomarker nucleic acid molecule. The kit can also comprise e.g. a buffering agent a preservative or a protein stabilizing agent. The kit can further comprise components necessary for detecting the detectable label e.g. an enzyme or a substrate . The kit can also contain a control sample or a series of control samples which can be assayed and compared to the test sample. Each component of the kit can be enclosed within an individual container and all of the various containers can be within a single package along with instructions for interpreting the results of the assays performed using the kit.

For this method an example of a preferred EGFR kinase inhibitor would be erlotinib including pharmacologically acceptable salts or polymorphs thereof. In this method one or more additional anti cancer agents or treatments can be co administered simultaneously or sequentially with the EGFR kinase inhibitor as judged to be appropriate by the administering physician given the prediction of the likely responsiveness of the patient to an EGFR kinase inhibitor in combination with any additional circumstances pertaining to the individual patient.

It will be appreciated by one of skill in the medical arts that the exact manner of administering to said patient of a therapeutically effective amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor following a diagnosis of a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor will be at the discretion of the attending physician. The mode of administration including dosage combination with other anti cancer agents timing and frequency of administration and the like may be affected by the diagnosis of a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor as well as the patient s condition and history. Thus even patients diagnosed with tumors predicted to be relatively insensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors may still benefit from treatment with such inhibitors particularly in combination with other anti cancer agents or agents that may alter a tumor s sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors.

In one embodiment of this method the panel of tumor cells is a panel of tumor cell lines. In an alternative embodiment the panel of tumor cells is a panel of primary tumor cells prepared from tumor samples derived from patients or experimental animal models.

The present invention provides a method for the identification of an agent that enhances sensitivity of the growth of a tumor cell to an EGFR kinase inhibitor said tumor cell having being characterized as one that has previously undergone an epithelial mesenchymal transition comprising contacting a sample of said tumor cells with an EGFR kinase inhibitor contacting an identical sample of said tumor cells with an EGFR kinase inhibitor in the presence of a test agent comparing the EGFR kinase inhibitor mediated growth inhibition in the presence and absence of the test agent and determining whether the test agent is an agent that enhances sensitivity of the growth of the tumor cell to an EGFR kinase inhibitor. For this method an example of a preferred EGFR kinase inhibitor would be erlotinib including pharmacologically acceptable salts or polymorphs thereof. In one embodiment of this method the sample of tumor cells can be cells in vitro such as a tumor cell line or a primary tumor cell culture. In an alternative embodiment the sample of tumor cells can be cells in vivo such as tumor cells in a mouse xenograft.

The present invention further provides the preceding methods for treating tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and in addition simultaneously or sequentially one or more anti hormonal agents.

The use of the cytotoxic and other anticancer agents described above in chemotherapeutic regimens is generally well characterized in the cancer therapy arts and their use herein falls under the same considerations for monitoring tolerance and effectiveness and for controlling administration routes and dosages with some adjustments. For example the actual dosages of the cytotoxic agents may vary depending upon the patient s cultured cell response determined by using histoculture methods. Generally the dosage will be reduced compared to the amount used in the absence of additional other agents.

Typical dosages of an effective cytotoxic agent can be in the ranges recommended by the manufacturer and where indicated by in vitro responses or responses in animal models can be reduced by up to about one order of magnitude concentration or amount. Thus the actual dosage will depend upon the judgment of the physician the condition of the patient and the effectiveness of the therapeutic method based on the in vitro responsiveness of the primary cultured malignant cells or histocultured tissue sample or the responses observed in the appropriate animal models.

The present invention further provides the preceding methods for treating tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and in addition simultaneously or sequentially treatment with radiation or a radiopharmaceutical.

The source of radiation can be either external or internal to the patient being treated. When the source is external to the patient the therapy is known as external beam radiation therapy EBRT . When the source of radiation is internal to the patient the treatment is called brachytherapy BT . Radioactive atoms for use in the context of this invention can be selected from the group including but not limited to radium cesium 137 iridium 192 americium 241 gold 198 cobalt 57 copper 67 technetium 99 iodine 123 iodine 131 and indium 111. Where the EGFR kinase inhibitor according to this invention is an antibody it is also possible to label the antibody with such radioactive isotopes.

Radiation therapy is a standard treatment for controlling unresectable or inoperable tumors and or tumor metastases. Improved results have been seen when radiation therapy has been combined with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is based on the principle that high dose radiation delivered to a target area will result in the death of reproductive cells in both tumor and normal tissues. The radiation dosage regimen is generally defined in terms of radiation absorbed dose Gy time and fractionation and must be carefully defined by the oncologist. The amount of radiation a patient receives will depend on various considerations but the two most important are the location of the tumor in relation to other critical structures or organs of the body and the extent to which the tumor has spread. A typical course of treatment for a patient undergoing radiation therapy will be a treatment schedule over a 1 to 6 week period with a total dose of between 10 and 80 Gy administered to the patient in a single daily fraction of about 1.8 to 2.0 Gy 5 days a week. In a preferred embodiment of this invention there is synergy when tumors in human patients are treated with the combination treatment of the invention and radiation. In other words the inhibition of tumor growth by means of the agents comprising the combination of the invention is enhanced when combined with radiation optionally with additional chemotherapeutic or anticancer agents. Parameters of adjuvant radiation therapies are for example contained in International Patent Publication WO 99 60023.

The present invention further provides the preceding methods for treating tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and in addition simultaneously or sequentially treatment with one or more agents capable of enhancing antitumor immune responses.

Agents capable of enhancing antitumor immune responses include for example CTLA4 cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen 4 antibodies e.g. MDX CTLA4 and other agents capable of blocking CTLA4. Specific CTLA4 antibodies that can be used in the present invention include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 682 736.

In the context of this invention an effective amount of an agent or therapy is as defined above. A sub therapeutic amount of an agent or therapy is an amount less than the effective amount for that agent or therapy but when combined with an effective or sub therapeutic amount of another agent or therapy can produce a result desired by the physician due to for example synergy in the resulting efficacious effects or reduced side effects.

As used herein the term patient preferably refers to a human in need of treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor for any purpose and more preferably a human in need of such a treatment to treat cancer or a precancerous condition or lesion. However the term patient can also refer to non human animals preferably mammals such as dogs cats horses cows pigs sheep and non human primates among others that are in need of treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor.

In a preferred embodiment the patient is a human in need of treatment for cancer a precancerous condition or lesion or other forms of abnormal cell growth. The cancer is preferably any cancer treatable either partially or completely by administration of an EGFR kinase inhibitor. The cancer may be for example lung cancer non small cell lung NSCL cancer bronchioloalviolar cell lung cancer bone cancer pancreatic cancer skin cancer cancer of the head or neck cutaneous or intraocular melanoma uterine cancer ovarian cancer rectal cancer cancer of the anal region stomach cancer gastric cancer colon cancer breast cancer uterine cancer carcinoma of the fallopian tubes carcinoma of the endometrium carcinoma of the cervix carcinoma of the vagina carcinoma of the vulva Hodgkin s Disease cancer of the esophagus cancer of the small intestine cancer of the endocrine system cancer of the thyroid gland cancer of the parathyroid gland cancer of the adrenal gland sarcoma of soft tissue cancer of the urethra cancer of the penis prostate cancer cancer of the bladder cancer of the kidney or ureter renal cell carcinoma carcinoma of the renal pelvis mesothelioma hepatocellular cancer biliary cancer chronic or acute leukemia lymphocytic lymphomas neoplasms of the central nervous system CNS spinal axis tumors brain stem glioma glioblastoma multiforme astrocytomas schwannomas ependymomas medulloblastomas meningiomas squamous cell carcinomas pituitary adenomas including refractory versions of any of the above cancers or a combination of one or more of the above cancers. The precancerous condition or lesion includes for example the group consisting of oral leukoplakia actinic keratosis solar keratosis precancerous polyps of the colon or rectum gastric epithelial dysplasia adenomatous dysplasia hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome HNPCC Barrett s esophagus bladder dysplasia and precancerous cervical conditions.

For purposes of the present invention co administration of and co administering an EGFR kinase inhibitor with an additional anti cancer agent both components referred to hereinafter as the two active agents refer to any administration of the two active agents either separately or together where the two active agents are administered as part of an appropriate dose regimen designed to obtain the benefit of the combination therapy. Thus the two active agents can be administered either as part of the same pharmaceutical composition or in separate pharmaceutical compositions. The additional agent can be administered prior to at the same time as or subsequent to administration of the EGFR kinase inhibitor or in some combination thereof. Where the EGFR kinase inhibitor is administered to the patient at repeated intervals e.g. during a standard course of treatment the additional agent can be administered prior to at the same time as or subsequent to each administration of the EGFR kinase inhibitor or some combination thereof or at different intervals in relation to the EGFR kinase inhibitor treatment or in a single dose prior to at any time during or subsequent to the course of treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor.

The EGFR kinase inhibitor will typically be administered to the patient in a dose regimen that provides for the most effective treatment of the cancer from both efficacy and safety perspectives for which the patient is being treated as known in the art and as disclosed e.g. in International Patent Publication No. WO 01 34574. In conducting the treatment method of the present invention the EGFR kinase inhibitor can be administered in any effective manner known in the art such as by oral topical intravenous intra peritoneal intramuscular intra articular subcutaneous intranasal intra ocular vaginal rectal or intradermal routes depending upon the type of cancer being treated the type of EGFR kinase inhibitor being used for example small molecule antibody RNAi ribozyme or antisense construct and the medical judgement of the prescribing physician as based e.g. on the results of published clinical studies.

The amount of EGFR kinase inhibitor administered and the timing of EGFR kinase inhibitor administration will depend on the type species gender age weight etc. and condition of the patient being treated the severity of the disease or condition being treated and on the route of administration. For example small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors can be administered to a patient in doses ranging from 0.001 to 100 mg kg of body weight per day or per week in single or divided doses or by continuous infusion see for example International Patent Publication No. WO 01 34574 . In particular erlotinib HCl can be administered to a patient in doses ranging from 5 200 mg per day or 100 1600 mg per week in single or divided doses or by continuous infusion. A preferred dose is 150 mg day. Antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors or antisense RNAi or ribozyme constructs can be administered to a patient in doses ranging from 0.1 to 100 mg kg of body weight per day or per week in single or divided doses or by continuous infusion. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.

The EGFR kinase inhibitors and other additional agents can be administered either separately or together by the same or different routes and in a wide variety of different dosage forms. For example the EGFR kinase inhibitor is preferably administered orally or parenterally. Where the EGFR kinase inhibitor is erlotinib HCl TARCEVA oral administration is preferable. Both the EGFR kinase inhibitor and other additional agents can be administered in single or multiple doses.

The EGFR kinase inhibitor can be administered with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets capsules lozenges troches hard candies powders sprays creams salves suppositories jellies gels pastes lotions ointments elixirs syrups and the like. Administration of such dosage forms can be carried out in single or multiple doses. Carriers include solid diluents or fillers sterile aqueous media and various non toxic organic solvents etc. Oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and or flavored.

The EGFR kinase inhibitor can be combined together with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of sprays creams salves suppositories jellies gels pastes lotions ointments and the like. Administration of such dosage forms can be carried out in single or multiple doses. Carriers include solid diluents or fillers sterile aqueous media and various non toxic organic solvents etc.

All formulations comprising proteinaceous EGFR kinase inhibitors should be selected so as to avoid denaturation and or degradation and loss of biological activity of the inhibitor.

Methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising an EGFR kinase inhibitor are known in the art and are described e.g. in International Patent Publication No. WO 01 34574. In view of the teaching of the present invention methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising an EGFR kinase inhibitor will be apparent from the above cited publications and from other known references such as Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 18edition 1990 .

For oral administration of EGFR kinase inhibitors tablets containing one or both of the active agents are combined with any of various excipients such as for example micro crystalline cellulose sodium citrate calcium carbonate dicalcium phosphate and glycine along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably corn potato or tapioca starch alginic acid and certain complex silicates together with granulation binders like polyvinyl pyrrolidone sucrose gelatin and acacia. Additionally lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration the EGFR kinase inhibitor may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents coloring matter or dyes and if so desired emulsifying and or suspending agents as well together with such diluents as water ethanol propylene glycol glycerin and various like combinations thereof.

For parenteral administration of either or both of the active agents solutions in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed as well as sterile aqueous solutions comprising the active agent or a corresponding water soluble salt thereof. Such sterile aqueous solutions are preferably suitably buffered and are also preferably rendered isotonic e.g. with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intra articular intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Any parenteral formulation selected for administration of proteinaceous EGFR kinase inhibitors should be selected so as to avoid denaturation and loss of biological activity of the inhibitor.

Additionally it is possible to topically administer either or both of the active agents by way of for example creams lotions jellies gels pastes ointments salves and the like in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice. For example a topical formulation comprising an EGFR kinase inhibitor in about 0.1 w v to about 5 w v concentration can be prepared.

For veterinary purposes the active agents can be administered separately or together to animals using any of the forms and by any of the routes described above. In a preferred embodiment the EGFR kinase inhibitor is administered in the form of a capsule bolus tablet liquid drench by injection or as an implant. As an alternative the EGFR kinase inhibitor can be administered with the animal feedstuff and for this purpose a concentrated feed additive or premix may be prepared for a normal animal feed. Such formulations are prepared in a conventional manner in accordance with standard veterinary practice.

As used herein the term EGFR kinase inhibitor refers to any EGFR kinase inhibitor that is currently known in the art or that will be identified in the future and includes any chemical entity that upon administration to a patient results in inhibition of a biological activity associated with activation of the EGF receptor in the patient including any of the downstream biological effects otherwise resulting from the binding to EGFR of its natural ligand. Such EGFR kinase inhibitors include any agent that can block EGFR activation or any of the downstream biological effects of EGFR activation that are relevant to treating cancer in a patient. Such an inhibitor can act by binding directly to the intracellular domain of the receptor and inhibiting its kinase activity. Alternatively such an inhibitor can act by occupying the ligand binding site or a portion thereof of the EGF receptor thereby making the receptor inaccessible to its natural ligand so that its normal biological activity is prevented or reduced. Alternatively such an inhibitor can act by modulating the dimerization of EGFR polypeptides or interaction of EGFR polypeptide with other proteins or enhance ubiquitination and endocytotic degradation of EGFR. EGFR kinase inhibitors include but are not limited to low molecular weight inhibitors antibodies or antibody fragments antisense constructs small inhibitory RNAs i.e. RNA interference by dsRNA RNAi and ribozymes. In a preferred embodiment the EGFR kinase inhibitor is a small organic molecule or an antibody that binds specifically to the human EGFR.

Additional non limiting examples of low molecular weight EGFR kinase inhibitors include any of the EGFR kinase inhibitors described in Traxler P. 1998 Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 8 12 1599 1625.

Specific preferred examples of low molecular weight EGFR kinase inhibitors that can be used according to the present invention include 6 7 bis 2 methoxyethoxy 4 quinazolin 4 yl 3 ethynylphenyl amine also known as OSI 774 erlotinib or TARCEVA erlotinib HCl OSI Pharmaceuticals Genentech Roche U.S. Pat. No. 5 747 498 International Patent Publication No. WO 01 34574 and Moyer J. D. et al. 1997 Cancer Res. 57 4838 4848 CI 1033 formerly known as PD183805 Pfizer Sherwood et al. 1999 Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 40 723 PD 158780 Pfizer AG 1478 University of California CGP 59326 Novartis PKI 166 Novartis EKB 569 Wyeth GW 2016 also known as GW 572016 or lapatinib ditosylate GSK and gefitinib also known as ZD1839 or IRESSA Astrazeneca Woodburn et al. 1997 Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 38 633 . A particularly preferred low molecular weight EGFR kinase inhibitor that can be used according to the present invention is 6 7 bis 2 methoxyethoxy 4 quinazolin 4 yl 3 ethynylphenyl amine i.e. erlotinib its hydrochloride salt i.e. erlotinib HCl TARCEVA or other salt forms e.g. erlotinib mesylate .

Antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors include any anti EGFR antibody or antibody fragment that can partially or completely block EGFR activation by its natural ligand. Non limiting examples of antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors include those described in Modjtahedi H. et al. 1993 Br. J. Cancer 67 247 253 Teramoto T. et al. 1996 Cancer 77 639 645 Goldstein et al. 1995 Clin. Cancer Res. 1 1311 1318 Huang S. M. et al. 1999 Cancer Res. 15 59 8 1935 40 and Yang X. et al. 1999 Cancer Res. 59 1236 1243. Thus the EGFR kinase inhibitor can be the monoclonal antibody Mab E7.6.3 Yang X. D. et al. 1999 Cancer Res. 59 1236 43 or Mab C225 ATCC Accession No. HB 8508 or an antibody or antibody fragment having the binding specificity thereof. Suitable monoclonal antibody EGFR kinase inhibitors include but are not limited to IMC C225 also known as cetuximab or ERBITUX Imclone Systems ABX EGF Abgenix EMD 72000 Merck KgaA Darmstadt RH3 York Medical Bioscience Inc. and MDX 447 Medarex Merck KgaA .

Additional antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors can be raised according to known methods by administering the appropriate antigen or epitope to a host animal selected e.g. from pigs cows horses rabbits goats sheep and mice among others. Various adjuvants known in the art can be used to enhance antibody production.

Although antibodies useful in practicing the invention can be polyclonal monoclonal antibodies are preferred. Monoclonal antibodies against EGFR can be prepared and isolated using any technique that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. Techniques for production and isolation include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein Nature 1975 256 495 497 the human B cell hybridoma technique Kosbor et al. 1983 Immunology Today 4 72 Cote et al. 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 2026 2030 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al. 1985 Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 .

Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 can be adapted to produce anti EGFR single chain antibodies. Antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors useful in practicing the present invention also include anti EGFR antibody fragments including but not limited to F ab .sub.2 fragments which can be generated by pepsin digestion of an intact antibody molecule and Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab .sub.2 fragments. Alternatively Fab and or scFv expression libraries can be constructed see e.g. Huse et al. 1989 Science 246 1275 1281 to allow rapid identification of fragments having the desired specificity to EGFR.

Techniques for the production and isolation of monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments are well known in the art and are described in Harlow and Lane 1988 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and in J. W. Goding 1986 Monoclonal Antibodies Principles and Practice Academic Press London. Humanized anti EGFR antibodies and antibody fragments can also be prepared according to known techniques such as those described in Vaughn T. J. et al. 1998 Nature Biotech. 16 535 539 and references cited therein and such antibodies or fragments thereof are also useful in practicing the present invention.

EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention can alternatively be based on antisense oligonucleotide constructs. Anti sense oligonucleotides including anti sense RNA molecules and anti sense DNA molecules would act to directly block the translation of EGFR mRNA by binding thereto and thus preventing protein translation or increasing mRNA degradation thus decreasing the level of EGFR kinase protein and thus activity in a cell. For example antisense oligonucleotides of at least about 15 bases and complementary to unique regions of the mRNA transcript sequence encoding EGFR can be synthesized e.g. by conventional phosphodiester techniques and administered by e.g. intravenous injection or infusion. Methods for using antisense techniques for specifically inhibiting gene expression of genes whose sequence is known are well known in the art e.g. see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 566 135 6 566 131 6 365 354 6 410 323 6 107 091 6 046 321 and 5 981 732 .

Small inhibitory RNAs siRNAs can also function as EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention. EGFR gene expression can be reduced by contacting the tumor subject or cell with a small double stranded RNA dsRNA or a vector or construct causing the production of a small double stranded RNA such that expression of EGFR is specifically inhibited i.e. RNA interference or RNAi . Methods for selecting an appropriate dsRNA or dsRNA encoding vector are well known in the art for genes whose sequence is known e.g. see Tuschi T. et al. 1999 Genes Dev. 13 24 3191 3197 Elbashir S. M. et al. 2001 Nature 411 494 498 Hannon G. J. 2002 Nature 418 244 251 McManus M. T. and Sharp P. A. 2002 Nature Reviews Genetics 3 737 747 Bremmelkamp T. R. et al. 2002 Science 296 550 553 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 573 099 and 6 506 559 and International Patent Publication Nos. WO 01 36646 WO 99 32619 and WO 01 68836 .

Ribozymes can also function as EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention. Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Engineered hairpin or hammerhead motif ribozyme molecules that specifically and efficiently catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of EGFR mRNA sequences are thereby useful within the scope of the present invention. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are initially identified by scanning the target molecule for ribozyme cleavage sites which typically include the following sequences GUA GUU and GUC. Once identified short RNA sequences of between about 15 and 20 ribonucleotides corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site can be evaluated for predicted structural features such as secondary structure that can render the oligonucleotide sequence unsuitable. The suitability of candidate targets can also be evaluated by testing their accessibility to hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides using e.g. ribonuclease protection assays.

Both antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes useful as EGFR kinase inhibitors can be prepared by known methods. These include techniques for chemical synthesis such as e.g. by solid phase phosphoramadite chemical synthesis. Alternatively anti sense RNA molecules can be generated by in vitro or in vivo transcription of DNA sequences encoding the RNA molecule. Such DNA sequences can be incorporated into a wide variety of vectors that incorporate suitable RNA polymerase promoters such as the T7 or SP6 polymerase promoters. Various modifications to the oligonucleotides of the invention can be introduced as a means of increasing intracellular stability and half life. Possible modifications include but are not limited to the addition of flanking sequences of ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides to the 5 and or 3 ends of the molecule or the use of phosphorothioate or 2 O methyl rather than phosphodiesterase linkages within the oligonucleotide backbone.

In the context of the methods of treatment of this invention EGFR kinase inhibitors are used as a composition comprised of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a non toxic therapeutically effective amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor compound including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof .

The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic bases or acids. When a compound of the present invention is acidic its corresponding salt can be conveniently prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from such inorganic bases include aluminum ammonium calcium copper cupric and cuprous ferric ferrous lithium magnesium manganese manganic and manganous potassium sodium zinc and the like salts. Particularly preferred are the ammonium calcium magnesium potassium and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non toxic bases include salts of primary secondary and tertiary amines as well as cyclic amines and substituted amines such as naturally occurring and synthesized substituted amines. Other pharmaceutically acceptable organic non toxic bases from which salts can be formed include ion exchange resins such as for example arginine betaine caffeine choline N N dibenzylethylenediamine diethylamine 2 diethylaminoethanol 2 dimethylaminoethanol ethanolamine ethylenediamine N ethylmorpholine N ethylpiperidine glucamine glucosamine histidine hydrabamine isopropylamine lysine methylglucamine morpholine piperazine piperidine polyamine resins procaine purines theobromine triethylamine trimethylamine tripropylamine tromethamine and the like.

When a compound used in the present invention is basic its corresponding salt can be conveniently prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acids including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include for example acetic benzenesulfonic benzoic camphorsulfonic citric ethanesulfonic fumaric gluconic glutamic hydrobromic hydrochloric isethionic lacetic maleic malic mandelic methanesulfonic mucic nitric pamoic pantothenic phosphoric succinic sulfuric tartaric p toluenesulfonic acid and the like. Particularly preferred are citric hydrobromic hydrochloric maleic phosphoric sulfuric and tartaric acids.

Pharmaceutical compositions used in the present invention comprising an EGFR kinase inhibitor compound including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as active ingredient can include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients or adjuvants. Other therapeutic agents may include those cytotoxic chemotherapeutic or anti cancer agents or agents which enhance the effects of such agents as listed above. The compositions include compositions suitable for oral rectal topical and parenteral including subcutaneous intramuscular and intravenous administration although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the particular host and nature and severity of the conditions for which the active ingredient is being administered. The pharmaceutical compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.

In practice the EGFR kinase inhibitor compounds including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration e.g. oral or parenteral including intravenous . Thus the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be presented as discrete units suitable for oral administration such as capsules cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Further the compositions can be presented as a powder as granules as a solution as a suspension in an aqueous liquid as a non aqueous liquid as an oil in water emulsion or as a water in oil liquid emulsion. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above an EGFR kinase inhibitor compound including pharmaceutically acceptable salts of each component thereof may also be administered by controlled release means and or delivery devices. The combination compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general such methods include a step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the carrier that constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. The product can then be conveniently shaped into the desired presentation.

An EGFR kinase inhibitor compound including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof used in this invention can also be included in pharmaceutical compositions in combination with one or more other therapeutically active compounds. Other therapeutically active compounds may include those cytotoxic chemotherapeutic or anti cancer agents or agents which enhance the effects of such agents as listed above.

Thus in one embodiment of this invention the pharmaceutical composition can comprise an EGFR kinase inhibitor compound in combination with an anticancer agent wherein said anti cancer agent is a member selected from the group consisting of alkylating drugs antimetabolites microtubule inhibitors podophyllotoxins antibiotics nitrosoureas hormone therapies kinase inhibitors activators of tumor cell apoptosis and antiangiogenic agents.

The pharmaceutical carrier employed can be for example a solid liquid or gas. Examples of solid carriers include lactose terra alba sucrose talc gelatin agar pectin acacia magnesium stearate and stearic acid. Examples of liquid carriers are sugar syrup peanut oil olive oil and water. Examples of gaseous carriers include carbon dioxide and nitrogen.

In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form any convenient pharmaceutical media may be employed. For example water glycols oils alcohols flavoring agents preservatives coloring agents and the like may be used to form oral liquid preparations such as suspensions elixirs and solutions while carriers such as starches sugars microcrystalline cellulose diluents granulating agents lubricants binders disintegrating agents and the like may be used to form oral solid preparations such as powders capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration tablets and capsules are the preferred oral dosage units whereby solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. Optionally tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.

A tablet containing the composition used for this invention may be prepared by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients or adjuvants. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder lubricant inert diluent surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Each tablet preferably contains from about 0.05 mg to about 5 g of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule preferably contains from about 0.05 mg to about 5 g of the active ingredient.

For example a formulation intended for the oral administration to humans may contain from about 0.5 mg to about 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material that may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Unit dosage forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 2 g of the active ingredient typically 25 mg 50 mg 100 mg 200 mg 300 mg 400 mg 500 mg 600 mg 800 mg or 1000 mg.

Pharmaceutical compositions used in the present invention suitable for parenteral administration may be prepared as solutions or suspensions of the active compounds in water. A suitable surfactant can be included such as for example hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Further a preservative can be included to prevent the detrimental growth of microorganisms.

Pharmaceutical compositions used in the present invention suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions. Furthermore the compositions can be in the form of sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of such sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the final injectable form must be sterile and must be effectively fluid for easy syringability. The pharmaceutical compositions must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage thus preferably should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol e.g. glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol vegetable oils and suitable mixtures thereof.

Pharmaceutical compositions for the present invention can be in a form suitable for topical sue such as for example an aerosol cream ointment lotion dusting powder or the like. Further the compositions can be in a form suitable for use in transdermal devices. These formulations may be prepared utilizing an EGFR kinase inhibitor compound including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof via conventional processing methods. As an example a cream or ointment is prepared by admixing hydrophilic material and water together with about 5 wt to about 10 wt of the compound to produce a cream or ointment having a desired consistency.

Pharmaceutical compositions for this invention can be in a form suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid. It is preferable that the mixture forms unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art. The suppositories may be conveniently formed by first admixing the composition with the softened or melted carrier s followed by chilling and shaping in molds.

In addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients the pharmaceutical formulations described above may include as appropriate one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents buffers flavoring agents binders surface active agents thickeners lubricants preservatives including anti oxidants and the like. Furthermore other adjuvants can be included to render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Compositions containing an EGFR kinase inhibitor compound including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may also be prepared in powder or liquid concentrate form.

Dosage levels for the compounds used for practicing this invention will be approximately as described herein or as described in the art for these compounds. It is understood however that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age body weight general health sex diet time of administration route of administration rate of excretion drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.

Inhibitors of EGF receptor function have shown clinical utility and the definition of key EGF receptor signaling pathways which describe patient subsets most likely to benefit from therapy has become an important area of investigation. Mutations which activate the receptor s intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and or increase downstream signaling have been observed in NSCLC and glioblastoma. However the role of mutations as a principle mechanism in conferring sensitivity to EGF receptor inhibitors has been controversial. In vitro and clinical studies have shown considerable variability between wt EGF receptor cell lines and tumors in their cellular responses to EGF receptor inhibition which in part has been shown to derive from EGF receptor independent activation of the phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase pathway leading to the continued phosphorylation of the anti apoptotic serine threonine kinase Akt. The molecular determinants to alternative routes of PI3 kinase activation and consequent EGF receptor inhibitor insensitivity are an active area of investigation. For example the insulin like growth factor 1 receptor IGF 1 receptor which strongly activates the PI3 kinase pathway has been implicated in cellular resistance to EGF inhibitors. The roles of cell cell and cell adhesion networks which can also exert survival signals through the PI3 kinase pathway in mediating insensitivity to selective EGF receptor inhibition are less clear and would be postulated to impact cell sensitivity to EGF receptor blockade. The ability of tumor cells to maintain growth and survival signals in the absence of adhesion to extracellular matrix or cell cell contacts is important not only in the context of cell migration and metastasis but also in maintaining cell proliferation and survival in wound like tumor environments where extracellular matrix is being remodeled and cell contact inhibition is diminished. Here we demonstrate that sensitivity of NSCLC and pancreatic cells to EGF receptor inhibition is conferred by an E cadherin epithelial cell phenotype in which ErbB family member signaling was active. Conversely insensitivity to EGF receptor inhibition was mediated through an epithelial mesenchymal transition EMT associated with the expression of vimentin and or fibronectin.

The NSCLC lines with wt EGFR H292 H358 H322 H441 A549 Calu6 H460 H1703 and SW1573 were cultured in the appropriate ATCC recommended supplemented media. The human NSCLC lines H1299 H266 H522 H650 H1437 H1155 Calu1 Hop92 and H23 were also cultured in the appropriate ATCC recommended supplemented media.

Anti phosphotyrosine immunoaffinity resins were prepared by covalent coupling to a solid support by standard methods. Freshly prepared immunoaffinity resins were used for each biological experiment to maximize binding and reduce carryover. Briefly anti phosphotyrosine antibodies were crosslinked to solid support and non covalently bound IgG removed by low pH elution. Fresh affinity resins were prepared for each biological experiment to avoid cross contamination. Proteins isolated by anti phosphotyrosine affinity selection were measured by iTRAQ labeling of tryptic peptides as previously described Ross et al 2004 Mol Cell Proteomics 3 12 1154 1169 Haley et al. 2004 . Peptide masses and sequence information were determined by electrospray LC MS MS and database searching.

On day 1 NSCLC cells were plated 3 5 10cells well in 96 well plates in their normal serum containing media. After 24 h erlotinib was added to the plates at a 10 concentration in a 10 DMSO water solution to achieve a final assay concentration range from 20 M to 8 nM. Dilutions were made in 3 fold steps. Final DMSO concentrations in each well was constant and did not exceed 1 . Following erlotinib addition cells were replaced in the incubator and left for 72 h. On day 5 Cell Titer Glo Promega was used to assess the effects on cell viability. Manufacturers instructions were followed for the assay. Experiments were conducted in triplicate to at least an n 3. Data was normalized as a percentage inhibition compared to DMSO only control wells and concentration response analysis was performed using Prizm graphing software.

Female CD 1 nu nu mice Charles River Laboratories were implanted with harvested NSCLC tumor cells in a single subcutaneous site on the flank of the mice in the axillary region. Tumors were allowed to grow to 200 50 mm at which time the animals were sorted into treatment groups of 8 animals per group based on weight 1 g body weight and tattooed on the tail for permanent identification. Tumor volumes and body weights were determined twice weekly. The tumor volume was determined by measuring in two directions with vernier calipers and calculated using the formula Tumor volume length width 2. The data were plotted as the change in mean values of tumor volume and body weight for each group. The tumor growth inhibition TGI was determined as TGI 100 1 W W where Wis the median tumor volume of the treated group at time x and Wis the median tumor volume of the control group at time x. TARCEVA was dosed in a 6 Captisol CyDex Inc in WFI Water for Injection solution and all control animals were dosed with an equal volume of the vehicle. Tumor growth inhibition studies were dosed by oral gavage once a day for 14 days. Pharmacodynamic studies were dosed by oral gavage for 1 3 days with tumors from 4 control and 4 TARCEVA treated animals harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen 4 hours after dosing on Days 1 2 and 3.

Cells grown on glass coverslips for 24 hours were washed and fixed with 3.7 formaldehyde in PBS followed by permeabilization in 0.5 NP 40. The cells were washed blocked with 5 BSA and incubated with primary antibody for 2 hours at room temperature and with diluted FITC conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour. Nuclei were stained with DAPI 300 nM for 5 min . The confocal images were captured using a spinning objective confocal microscope at 60 magnification.

NSCLC cell lines containing mutations in the catalytic domain of EGFR displayed hypersensitivity to treatment with the selective EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. It has been suggested that only those patients bearing such mutations would respond and or show survival benefit from treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial conducted with erlotinib indicated that the survival rate of patients exposed to the drug was well in excess of the predicted occurrence of such mutations in the patient population. This suggested that although mutations were an indicator of patient response other factors were undoubtedly involved in conferring survival benefit.

Initially the receptor for epidermal growth factor EGFR was sequenced in 14 NSCLC cell lines. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the EGFR expressed in all of the cell lines of this study was wild type with respect to two recently identified mutations deletion and point mutations data not shown . Having determined that the receptors were wild type the sensitivity of the panel of non small cell lung cancer cell lines to erlotinib was assessed using a cell viability assay.

Analysis of erlotinib sensitivity in a range of human NSCLC cell lines which are wild type for EGFR indicated a wide range of sensitivity Table 2 Griffin et al. 2005 . We have thus broadly classified these cell lines into those that are relatively insensitive H1703 SW1573 H460 and Calu6 those which show an intermediate sensitivity A549 and those which are sensitive H441 H358 H322 and H292 to erlotinib mediated growth inhibition in vitro and in xenografts. These differences can be correlated in part to a failure of the relatively insensitive cell lines to show erlotinib mediated inhibition of Akt PKB phosphorylation Griffin et al. 2005 . A range of sensitivities of the cells to erlotinib was observed from cells lines ranging from the most sensitive H292 through the least sensitive H460 . There were few correlations between tumor type and erlotinib sensitivity although it is interesting to note that both of the bronchioalveolar carcinoma BAC derived cell lines H358 and H322 showed a level of sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. Previous reports from clinical trials have suggested that of the population of NSCLC patients those with BAC histologies tended to have a greater treatment benefit than other NSCLC patients. However more BAC derived cell lines should be tested prior to making any conclusions. The data from the in vitro pharmacology experiments is summarized in Table 2. The concentration response curves were analyzed in two ways. Firstly in order to define the more traditionally accepted IC50 values not shown the curves have been fit in a 0 100 range. However since erlotinib and other EGFR inhibitors may be described as cytostatic rather than cytotoxic and therefore would therefore never be expected to achieve complete cell kill it is questionable how relevant an IC50 value is. Indeed even in the most sensitive lines a maximal efficacy of about 70 80 was the most observed. Therefore an EC50 constraining the curves from 0 80 is a more relevant potency comparison.

In order to determine the relevance of the in vitro cell viability assay to in vivo efficacy a selection of cell lines ranging from sensitive through insensitive in vitro were tested in mouse xenograft models. The data from these experiments are shown in and Table 2. The correlation between in vitro sensitivity and in vivo sensitivity to erlotinib was striking. Those cells that were most sensitive in vitro were also the most sensitive in vivo with the rank order of sensitivities of all cell lines being identical between the two assays. Such a finding strongly supports the use of the in vitro assay as an initial guide for assessing erlotinib sensitivity in xenograft models. The cell lines chosen were picked for their range of sensitivities based on in vitro and in vivo activities. Although a somewhat subjective classification two sensitive lines H292 and H358 two intermediate H441 and A549 and two insensitive H460 and Calu 6 were selected. Despite its low sensitivity in vitro A549 were classed as an intermediate cell line due to a low level of response in vivo. The principle aim of further study was to determine the molecular determinants of erlotinib sensitivity in these NSCLC cell lines.

Changes in Epithelial and Mesenchymal Cell Markers Correlate with Sensitivity of NSCLC Cell Lines to Erlotinib

Initially differences in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and complex formation between NSCLC lines sensitive or relatively insensitive to erlotinib in vitro and in xenograft models were measured. These experiments involved anti phosphotyrosine affinity selection of cell lysates tryptic digestion and protein identification based on LC MS MS fragment ion spectra. We observed a striking difference between the erlotinib sensitive and relatively insensitive NSCLC lines in the abnormal expression vimentin and or fibronectin . Typically vimentin and fibronectin expression are characteristic of mesenchymal cells and are only weakly or unexpressed in epithelial cell lineages. Vimentin expression was primarily found in H1703 and Calu6 while fibronectin expression was observed in H460 cells. These three NSCLC lines were relatively insensitive to growth inhibition by erlotinib in vitro 10 uM EC and in vivo at 200 mg kg orally qd . Little or no vimentin or fibronectin expression was found in the erlotinib sensitive NSCLC lines H292 and H358 the intermediate line A549 or in the two mutant EGF receptor cell lines H1650 and H1975.

Based on the expression of mesenchymal proteins in NSCLC lines relatively insensitive to erlotinib we analyzed protein extracts from the same panel of relatively insensitive and sensitive NSCLC cell lines for the presence or absence of markers characteristic of either epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes . Strikingly E cadherin was detected in the sensitive cell lines H441 H358 H322 and H292 but was absent in the relatively insensitive cell lines H1703 SW1573 H460 and Calu6 . The intermediately sensitive cell line A549 showed low but detectable expression. A similar loss of catenin was observed in cells relatively insensitive to erlotinib with the exception of H460. Therefore the relatively insensitive cell lines appear to have lost expression of epithelial cell marker proteins. Next we asked whether these cell lines expressed the mesenchymal markers fibronectin and or vimentin. The relatively insensitive cell lines clearly expressed either one or both of fibronectin and vimentin whereas neither protein was detectable in cell lines sensitive to erlotinib. Interestingly the intermediately sensitive cell line A549 again showed low but detectable levels of both proteins. However confocal microcopy experiments results not shown using immunostaining with antibodies specific for E cadherin and vimentin indicated that the A549 cell culture used appears to be a mixed population of cells since no dual staining of cells was observed. This could also explain the somewhat variable results obtained with this cell line and is consistent with its intermediate sensitivity to erlotinib.

The changes in cell lineage markers were further analyzed in two relatively insensitive and two sensitive cell lines by confocal microscopy after immunostaining with antibodies toward E cadherin and vimentin . No E cadherin staining could be detected in either H1703 or Calu6 cells panels 1 and 2 whereas all of these cells could be stained for vimentin panels 5 and 6 . The reverse was true for the sensitive cell lines H441 and H292 with clear E cadherin staining on the membrane of these cells panels 3 and 4 but no visible vimentin staining panels 7 and 8 . Taken together these data indicate that NSCLC cells which were relatively insensitive to growth inhibition by erlotinib appeared to have undergone transition to a more mesenchymal cell type and expressed either vimentin or fibronectin. In contrast cell lines that were sensitive to growth inhibition by erlotinib maintained an epithelial phenotype and expressed E cadherin.

Tumors xenografts derived from NSCLC cell lines grown in mice displayed a similar degree of erlotinib sensitivity to that observed for the respective cell line in vitro. We therefore wished to examine whether the protein markers identified in vitro were also predictive of erlotinib sensitivity in vivo. Protein extracts were prepared from 3 independent tumor xenografts grown from H460 Calu6 A549 H441 and H292 cells. Immunoblotting of extracts indicated that E cadherin was not detectably expressed in the xenografts derived from the H460 and Calu6 cells that are relatively insensitive to erlotinib was expressed at low levels in xenografts derived from the A549 cells of intermediate sensitivity and expressed at high levels in H441 and H292 cell lines sensitive to erlotinib . A similar result was observed on analysis of catenin levels. In contrast xenograft samples derived from Calu6 expressed fibronectin and vimentin Calu6 or fibronectin alone H460 a result consistent with that obtained from in vitro cell cultures . H441 and H292 derived xenograft extracts showed little or no expression of either fibronectin or vimentin. These in vivo results further support the in vitro data and indicate that the presence of these protein markers is not an artifact of cell culture. Further they support the hypothesis that erlotinib sensitivity may be restricted to cells with an epithelial phoenotype and that cells which have undergone EMT become less dependent upon EGFR signaling for cell proliferation and survival.

Expression of Brk in NSCLC Cell Lines that are Relatively Insensitive or Sensitive to EGF Receptor Inhibition

The results of these experiments led to the working hypothesis that erlotinib sensitivity is determined by the ability of the compound to inhibit Akt signaling. Following this hypothesis the question arises as to what is unique about these cells that allows the EGFR pathway to so significantly impact cellular Akt signaling. Recent papers by REFS have suggested an interesting potential link between EGFR and Akt signaling which may or may not involve heterodimerization with other Her members such as ErbB3 involving the non receptor tyrosine kinase Brk also known as PTK6 . It was of interest therefore to determine whether there may be any relationship between Brk expression in sensitive and insensitive erlotinib lines thus providing a rationale for why EGFR inhibition is so intricately linked to Akt in sensitive compared to insensitive. shows Western blot analysis of a number of lines from the NSCLC panel and their respective expression of Brk protein. Interestingly there is a very good correlation between Brk levels and erlotinib sensitivity in so far as high Brk expression equates to higher erlotinib sensitivity and absence or lower expression of Brk tends to characterize insensitive lines.

We next extended these studies to ask whether these observations would be applicable to other cancer cell types. As erlotinib has shown efficacy in Phase III combination studies with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer we examined the sensitivity of pancreatic cell lines to growth inhibition by erlotinib in vitro and their expression of epithelial and mesenchymal lineage markers. Consistent with data in NSCLC pancreatic cell lines sensitive to erlotinib expressed E cadherin but not vimentin or fibronectin while pancreatic lines that are relatively insensitive to erlotinib had lost E cadherin expression and gained vimentin and or fibronectin expression . These results were observed both by immunoblot and confocal fluorescence microscopy studies .

Patients with Tumors Expressing High Levels of E Cadherin have Greater Time to Disease Progression when Treated with Erlotinib Chemotherapy Compared to Chemotherapy Treatment Alone

Samples from patients who participated in a randomized double blinded phase III clinical trial referred to as Tribute were analyzed for E cadherin expression by Immunohistochemistry IHC . Tribute studied 1 079 patients at approximately 150 centers in the United States having histological confirmed NSCLC who had not received prior chemotherapy comparing erlotinib chemotherapy carboplatin paclitaxel with chemotherapy alone. Patients received paclitaxel 200 mg m3 hour i.v. infusion followed by carboplatin AUC 6 mg ml minute infused over 15 30 minutes using Calvert formula with or without erlotinib 100 mg day p.o. escalated to 150 mg day for tolerant patients . Tumor samples formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks or unstained slides from 87 patients in the Tribute trial were immunostained to detect E cadherin expression. Staining intensity was scored as 0 1 2 and 3 with 65 of the 87 samples having 2 staining intensity and 22 had 

Immunohistochemistry for E cadherin was performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections assembled in a tissue microarray. Following deparaffinization antigen retrieval was performed by pretreating with Target Retrieval Solution at 110 degrees C. for 20 min DakoCytomation Carpenteria Calif. . The pretreated sections were then incubated with primary mouse monoclonal IgG2 antibody against E cadherin clone 36 Pharmingen at a concentration of 1 microgram ml for 60 min at ambient temperature. Primary antibody bound to the sections was detected using biotinylated horse anti mouse IgG and visualized using the avidin biotin peroxidase complex technique Vectastain ABC Elite Vector Laboratories and diaminobenzidine as chromagen.

It was determined that patients whose tumors stained for high levels of membrane and cytoplasmic E cadherin exhibited significantly longer time to disease progression TTP when treated with the combination of erlotinib and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone 34.0 weeks v. 19.3 weeks p 0.0028 . The results are provided in table 2 and are illustrated by the Kaplan Meier curve in . Conversely patients whose tumors had low membrane and cytoplasmic E cadherin expression staining intensity of 

Proteins associated with survival signaling and epithelial mesenchymal cell phenotypes were isolated and measured using multiple experimental approaches including mass spectrometry. Individual protein abundance or extent of phosphorylation on tyrosine residues was compared between different NSCLC tumor lines. Mass spectrometry approaches additionally included cellular fractionation phosphotyrosine protein capture and phosphopeptide capture using four NSCLC model cell lines. The NSCLC lines were chosen to reflect a range of sensitivities to pharmacological EGFR inhibition both in vitro and in xenografts. These NSCLC lines also span both epithelial and mesenchymal like tumor phenotypes arising from EMT like transitions occurring during tumor progression. Two MS quantitation approaches were pursued. First between cell comparisons were performed where membrane particulate and cytosolic fractions were isolated and differences in protein abundance measured. In both cases the iTRAQ peptide labeling method was used to allow relative quantitation of proteins isolated under the different biological conditions. In a second paradigm within cell analyses were performed where within a given cell line EGF receptor kinase activity was inhibited 1 M erlotinib for 1 4 or 24 hours in EGF stimulated cells prior to lysis and both anti phosphotyrosine protein and peptide affinity capture. Protein samples were proteolytically cleaved with trypsin separately labeled with isobaric stable isotope mass labels iTRAQ Ross et al. 2005 Petti et al. 2005 combined and subjected to LC MS MS. Protein identification criteria conformed to the guidelines proposed by Bradshaw et al. Bradshaw R. A. Burlingame A. L. Carr S. and Aebersold R. 2006 Mol Cell Proteomics 5 787 788 .

Differential Protein Abundance and Tyrosine Phosphorylation Associated with Cell Adhesion Complexes Between Epithelial and Mesenchymal NSCLC Phenotypes.

Proteins differentially expressed in epithelial and mesenchymal like tumor cells are listed in for the cytosolic soluble fraction the membrane particulate fraction the cell surface cross linked fraction and the phosphoprotein capture fraction. These proteins are important in defining the epithelial and mesenchymal states of cells and in defining the appropriate treatment for such a tumor. Key proteins differentially expressed included 14 3 3 protein sigma 4F2 heavy chain 4F2 light chain AHNAK Desmoyokin Alpha 1 catenin Annexin A3 Basigin CD147 antigen Beta catenin Catenin delta 1 Cofilin 1 Cytokeratin 18 Cytokeratin 19 Cytokeratin 7 Cytokeratin 8 Junction plakoglobin E cadherin Ezrin p81 Filamin A Filamin B Integrin beta 4 Maspin protease inhibitor 5 Plectin 1 RhoA Transgelin 2 Tumor calcium transducer 1 Tumor calcium transducer 2 Annexin A6 Galectin 1 HLA class I A 1 alpha chain Myosin 10 Profilin 1 snRNP D3 Tubulin beta 3 and Vimentin.

Reciprocal regulation of cytoskeletal filament microtubule phosphoproteins was observed in NSCLC cells with mesenchymal and epithelial phenotypes within 1 hour of erlotinib exposure. Down regulation of and actins and vimentin was observed in mesenchyrnal like NSCLC cells while cells with an epithelial phenotype showed upregulation of Actin like protein 6A and actin. This was also observed in the phosphotyrosine capture fractions where both and actins were expressed only in mesenchymal like cells and were negatively regulated by EGFR inhibition. In contrast phosphotyrosine captured actin was only observed in cells with an epithelial phenotype and was not regulated by EGFR inhibition. A significant erlotinib dependent increase in phosphocapture of Rho GEF7 was observed in the mesenchymal like cells consistent with altered cytoskeletal networks in this more migratory invasive tumor stage. Reduced phospho cytokeratins 7 8 and 18 were observed in Calu6 relative to the epithelial lines H292 and H358 and were completely absent in H1703 consistent with the mesenchymal like phenotype of Calu6 and H1703. Similarly phosphocapture of and catenins was restricted to and 6 catenin markedly elevated in the tumor cells with an epithelial state H292 and H358 . Phosphotyrosine capture of plakophilins 2 3 4 Desmoplakin 3 and Integrin 4 were observed only NSCLC cells with an epithelial phenotype. Phospho E cadherin was only observed in H292 with an epithelial phenotype. In summary proteins regulating cell adhesion were prominently expressed in tumor cells with an epithelial phenotype but were reduced or absent in tumor cells with a more mesenchymal like phenotype. Differential expression and or regulation of the p130CAS paxillin containing cytoskeletal organizing complex or the heat shock protein complexes containing Hsp90 Hsp70 Hsp71 Hsp60 Hsp B1 Grp78 or Grp94 between epithelial and mesenchymal like lines was not apparent. This is consistent with the observation that the vast majority of proteins were relatively unchanged in abundance between epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes or in response to EGFR blockade with erlotinib.

The cellular effects of EGFR inhibition on phosphotyrosine protein capture were analyzed by the clustering of proteins in self organizing maps based on the temporal abundance of proteins identified and measured by LC MS MS approaches. Multiple known EGFR substrates were analyzed for co regulation and co clustering in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells phenotypes. These included Cbl Cbl B total ErbB2 total EGFR Grb2 Met RIPK2 SHC. Met and Ron phosphocapture was markedly elevated in epithelial like tumor cells as determined by unique and total peptide number. The phosphorylation state of both Met and Ron were significantly reduced upon cell treatment with EGFR inhibitor indicative of crosstalk between EGFR and Met Ron family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Erlotinob downregulation of tyrosine phosphorylation for Erk2 ubiquitin and the tyrosine phosphatases SHP 2 and BDP 18 was primarily associated with an epithelial cell state. In the other well studied mesenchymal like line Calu6 a high phospho Ret expression was observed and may contribute to the unusual EGFR independent phosphorylation of Erk2 MAPK1. In contrast in H292 H358 and H1703 cell backgrounds Erk2 phosphorylation was markedly and significantly attenuated by EGFR inhibition within 1 hour of exposure.

The expression and or regulation of multiple phosphoproteins were restricted to a particular cell type in a biologically interesting manner. For example the high phospho PDGF receptor expression was only observed in H1703 cells with lower abundance Fer and Fgr also observed. The phosphocapture of these proteins were not influenced by EGFR inhibition. This was accompanied by elevated phosphocapture of SOS 1 SHP 2 Intersectin 2 tyrosine protein kinase JAK1 GRB2 associated binding protein GAB1 Phospholipase C 1 PI3 kinase p110 subunits and and PI3 kinase p85 and subunits none of which were regulated by EGFR inhibition. The unique phosphocapture of the p21 activated kinase PAK2 in H1703 cells was stimulated at all time points by addition of erlotinib and may contribute to the constitutive expression of the zinc finger transcription factor Zeb1 TCF8 dEF1 within this NSCLC line having undergone and EMT like transition.

In Calu6 cells attenuated EGF dependent EGFR activation is observed. Grb2 and Cbl fail to become tyrosine phosphorylated in contrast to seven other NSCLC lines. Little difference in phospho capture of clathrin heavy chain could be detected indicating the defect was not likely to be at the level of EGFR internalization into coated pits. In contrast Shc is normally recruited and its phosphorylation can be markedly reduced by EGFR blockade in a manner similar to other lines H292 H358 H1650 A549 H1703 and H460 .

The hyaluronan motility receptor RHAMM was only detectable in the phosphotyrosine fraction of mesenchymal like lines and may contribute to the increased migratory and invasive character associated with the mesenchymal phenotype. This may be particularly important since the mesenchymal NSCLC lines have reduced levels of Basigin CD147 .

In conclusion the proteins and phosphoproteins listed above and in provide additional biomarkers that can be used for assessing the EMT status and thus sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors of tumor cells. Those protein biomarkers listed in a specific cellular compartment i.e. cytosolic membrane ot cell surface fractions and perhaps also one or more phosphoprotein fractions are proteins whose expression levels are altered as a result of EMT. Those proteins listed only in one or more phosphoprotein fractions have an altered phosphorylation level but not protein expression level in response to EMT. Thus in the latter case the phospho protein per se is the biomarker. Those tumor biomarkers listed in as being decreased in mesenchymal like cells are epithelial biomarkers high expression levels of which correlate with high sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors. Those biomarkers listed in as being increased in mesenchymal like cells are mesenchymal biomarkers high expression levels of which correlate with low sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors. Consequently for the biomarkers listed in a high ratio of epithelial to mesenchymal biomarker expression levels correlates with high sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors.

The biomarkers listed in as of mixed abundance in mesenchymal like cells are those for which an alteration in expression level of the protein and an altered phosphorylation state of the protein are predictive of different outcomes. For example the protein p185 Ron is a mesenchymal marker that is increased in expression after EMT and for which high expression levels correlate with low sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors whereas phospho p185 Ron is an epithelial marker that is decreased after EMT i.e. there is a decrease in the phosphorylation level of p185 Ron after EMT and for which high phosphorylation levels correlate with high sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors.

The biomarkers listed in as being increased or decreased in the mesenchymal cell lines H1703 or Calu6 are biomarkers that appear to be altered in a cell specific manner unlike the other biomarkers listed above them in which appear to be similarly altered in all tumor cells examined. Thus the mesenchymal cell lines H1703 or Calu6 are probably each representative of a subset of tumor cell types in which these cell specific biomarkers are altered in EMT and thus predictive of sensitivity to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors in these tumor types.

The loss of E cadherin expression and the acquisition of a more mesenchymal phenotype has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in multiple epithelial derived solid tumors. The loss of E cadherin and to a lesser extent catenin and Brk correlated with cellular and xenograft insensitivity to EGF receptor inhibition. Conversely the cellular acquisition of mesenchymal markers vimentin fibronectin or fibrillin correlates with a loss of sensitivity to EGF receptor inhibitors. We clearly show that a partial or complete epithelial to mesenchymal transition negatively impacts cellular responses to EGF receptor inhibitors in vitro and in xenografts and serves as a diagnostic for patients most likely to benefit from EGF receptor kinase inhibitors and anti EGF receptor antibody therapies.
