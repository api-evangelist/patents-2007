title: Launch and recovery system for unmanned undersea vehicles
abstract: A system operable by a single workman safely launches and recovers an unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) using a motor-driven carriage to transport the UUV to the water. The UUV is fitted to a reconfigurable sabot. An elevating ramp on the carriage supports the sabot and UUV on an elongate conveyer assembly having inclined rollers aligned with motor-driven belts to selectively outwardly and inwardly displace the UUV between the carriage and the water. Hinge members are used to rotatably connect the elevating ramp to the carriage, and a lifting mechanism connected to the carriage and ramp rotatably displaces the ramp about the hinge members. The rollers and belts displace the UUV on the conveyer assembly. A winch on the elevating ramp has a line connected to the UUV to lower and raise the UUV during launch and recovery operations.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

This invention relates to system for deploying and retrieving vehicles in water. More particularly this invention is to a portable launch and recovery system adaptable to different vehicles and platforms.

Currently launch and recovery of an unmanned undersea vehicle UUV into the water from a ship or land based launch platform relies on considerable manpower and equipment and consequently can be dangerous operations. During launch the elongate torpedo shaped UUV is usually so heavy as to require a heavy duty crane to lift it from the launch platform carefully move it around until it s over the water and slowly lower it into the water. Several workmen are needed to operate the crane and man the lines needed to guide the UUV. Even more personnel must be in a small boat in the water to bring the UUV safely into the water detach the hoist lines and make sure that the UUV does not impact the launch platform. During recovery the small boat must come alongside the UUV and its crew must reattach the hoist lines and quickly get out of the way as the crane raises the UUV from the water rotates it around and returns it to the platform. Throughout these procedures many workmen are involved in this hazardous activity and must be closely coordinated to avoid serious injuries and damage to the UUV. Routine adverse conditions of wind and waves add further complications to this dangerous process.

Thus in accordance with this inventive concept a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a system for launching and recovering different sized UUVs from different launch platforms with fewer personnel to increase safety and utilize less dangerous equipment.

The present invention provides a system and method operated by a single workman to safely launch and recover a UUV in water using a motor driven carriage to transport the UUV to the water. An elevating ramp on the carriage supports the UUV on an elongate conveyer assembly having inclined rollers aligned with motor driven belts to selectively move the UUV outwardly and inwardly between the carriage and the water. A sabot fits against different sizes of UUV and the inclined rollers and aligned belts to carry the UUV on the conveyer assembly. Hinge members are connected to the carriage and elevating ramp to rotatably connect the ramp and carriage and a lifting mechanism connected to the carriage and ramp rotatably displaces the ramp about the hinge members. A winch on the elevating ramp has a line connected to the UUV to bidirectionally displace the UUV on the elongate conveyer assembly during launch and recovery of the UUV. The sabot has contoured support members to support the UUV and the sabot has rigid hollow members nose clamp and tail clamp selectively filled with and vented of pressurized gas to selectively engage and release the UUV during launch and recovery operations. A remote control interface module is mounted on the carriage to actuate the carriage lifting mechanism winch and belts of the elongate conveyer assembly. A remote control transmits control signals to the interface module to control the carriage lifting mechanism winch and belts during launch and recovery of the UUV.

An object of the invention is to provide a system and method for reducing the hazards associated with launching and recovering a UUV at a launch platform.

Another object of the invention is to provide a remotely actuated system and method for reducing the hazards associated with launching and recovering a UUV at a launch platform.

Another object of the invention is to provide a portable system and method of launching and recovering a UUV requiring a reduced number of launch personnel at a launch platform.

Another object of the invention is to provide a system and method for launching and recovering a UUV at a launch platform using a sabot to launch and recover differently sized UUVs.

Another object of the invention is to provide for launching and recovering a UUV at a launch platform using a sabot and conveyer assembly rotated on a carriage to extend downward into the water to launch and recover UUVs of different sizes.

These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.

Referring to system of the invention for launching and recovering an unmanned underwater vehicle UUV is shown transporting UUV across a support surface to water . Support surface can be the relatively flat top of docks or the work area on the deck at the stern of a ship or other flat expanses on any of many different types of marine vessels from small craft to large ships. It is to be understood that use of the term ship as referred to herein is intended to include any and all of the different types of marine vessels that can have at least one support surface that can receive and support system . Typically support surface can extend from a supply or storage bay that can house UUV and surface can be at varying heights above the surface of water .

One of the advantages of launch and recovery system of the invention is its unique carriage that does much to do away with the excessive number of support personnel and heavy crane equipment that are otherwise used in conventional launch and recoveries of UUVs. Carriage of launch and recovery system is a heavy duty box shaped structure capable of bearing the load of torpedo shaped UUV that can weigh as much as 5000 pounds and extend as much as 20 feet in length. In the preferred embodiment carriage is substantially fabricated from heavy metal. This assures that the load of UUV and other hardware of system is adequately supported and that the mass of carriage helps to stabilize and counterweights UUV as it is transported launched and recovered.

Carriage has a remote control interface module schematically depicted in as being on one side. Interface module is activated by a remote control operated by a single workman or operator spaced away from carriage on surface or at some other convenient vantage point. Operator is separated a safe distance from carriage and UUV but is near enough to oversee and control the procedure of launch recovery of UUV via a wire link and or radio link communicating with interface module . Remote control can have a joy stick and trigger or similar uncomplicated arrangements of a few switches and or buttons to enable the initiation of appropriate control signals shown as arrow by operator . These control signals can actuate integral components to be described below on carriage to perform the mechanical operations necessary for launch recovery of UUV . Since control signals are initiated by the single operator from a safe distance away from the activity of launch and recovery system of the invention eliminates a major hazard otherwise associated with these dangerous activities.

Referring also to carriage has a set of dual wheels in a journal mount at each bottom corner to bear the load of UUV and system . Each dual wheel set is connected to a gear and drive chain mechanism connected to a drive motor electrically coupled to batteries in sealed housings and is capable of being bidirectionally rotated. At least one battery charger is connected to batteries for recharging them from a remote power source as needed.

Appropriate control signals received at interface module control the connection of responsive amounts of power from batteries to each drive motor for each motor s selective actuation. This actuation of each drive motor causes the interconnected gear and drive chain mechanism to selectively rotate each interconnected wheel set to not only propel carriage and UUV across support surface but when different amounts of electrical power are selectably coupled to different ones of the wheel sets by control signals carriage can be remotely steered and maneuvered across the support surface as well. Carriage has its internal electronic electro mechanical and mechanical components robustly fabricated and packaged to survive and function reliably when system of the invention is subjected to the ambient influences of water shocks vibrations etc. routinely expected in the harsh marine environment.

Carriage has a pair of hinge members connected to and between the outboard end of carriage and an elongate elevating ramp . Hinge members rotatably couple carriage and elevating ramp together via a heavy duty pin that laterally extends through hinge members and between the opposite sides of carriage to permit a downward and upward rotation of ramp to and from carriage . A lower side of elevating ramp abuts an upper side of carriage to support the load of UUV when elevating ramp is in the down position. When elevating ramp is in an upwardly rotated position during launch or recovery heavy duty lateral pin of elevating ramp supports a considerable portion of the load of UUV .

Referring additionally to a lifting mechanism is mounted on carriage and is connected to elevating ramp by a lateral coupling bar connected to a pair of heavy duty lift arms . Hydraulic pump motors of lifting mechanism are mounted in carriage at its opposite ends only one such motor being shown in it being understood that another hydraulic pump motor is at the opposite end inside of carriage . Each hydraulic pump motor is electrically coupled to batteries in sealed housings . Appropriate control signals received at interface module are used to connect appropriate amounts of power from batteries to each hydraulic pump motor for selective simultaneous actuation of a separate mechanically interconnected hydraulic pump and of lifting mechanism . Hydraulic pumps and are each connected to simultaneously hydraulically displace first and second pairs of hydraulic rams and of lifting mechanism in responsive simultaneous extending or retracting displacements as determined by control signals .

First pair of hydraulic rams is connected at their base ends to carriage and their displaceable shaft ends to a sliding plate member . Second pair of hydraulic rams is also connected at their base ends to carriage and their displaceable shaft ends to sliding plate member . Sliding plate member is retained on opposite sides in carriage by longitudinally extending roller tracks that only permit bidirectional longitudinal displacement of plate member in carriage . Sliding plate member is pivotally connected to one end of lift arms that are joined at their opposite ends to a lateral coupling bar .

First and second pairs of hydraulic rams and are simultaneously actuated by control signals at control interface module to simultaneously generate additive pushing and pulling forces to displace sliding plate member . In other words when control signals cause second set of rams to forcefully extend their plungers simultaneously with first set of rams being controlled to forcefully retract their plungers rams and respectively exert simultaneous additive pushing and pulling forces on sliding plate member that displace member between roller tracks toward hinge members . This forceful displacement of sliding plate member is transmitted to elongate elevating ramp via lift arms and lateral coupling bar to rotate ramp about lateral pin of hinge members . Ramp can be selectively rotated up to eighty degrees on pin as ramp is raised upward above carriage .

When control signals cause first set of rams to forcefully extend their plungers simultaneously with second set of rams being controlled to forcefully retract their plungers rams and respectively exert simultaneous additive pushing and pulling forces on sliding plate member that displace member between roller tracks in the opposite direction away from hinge members . This forceful displacement of sliding plate member in the opposite direction is transmitted to elongate elevating ramp via lift arms and lateral coupling bar to oppositely rotate ramp about lateral pin of hinge members in the opposite direction. Ramp can be selectively rotated from its position above carriage and lower ramp from above carriage downward to a position on carriage .

First set of rams and second set of rams are simultaneously actuated to enable the transfer of the hydraulic fluid between sets of rams and and reduce the total amount of hydraulic fluid that may be required in system . That is to say for example while plungers of ram set are being extended by pump and plungers of ram set are being retracted by pump to displace sliding plate member toward hinge members and rotatably raise elevating ramp the hydraulic fluid from rams can be fed via a feed line not shown between pumps and to rams . Conversely while plungers of ram set are being extended by pump and plungers of ram set are being retracted by pump to displace sliding plate member away from hinge members and rotatably lower elevating ramp the hydraulic fluid from rams can be fed via a feed line between pumps and to rams . This shared use of the hydraulic fluid between sets of rams and reduces the volume of fluid that might otherwise be needed by separated individual rams and contributes to reducing the size of reservoirs for such fluid. In fact using fresh water having a little soap added has proven to be an effective environmentally friendly hydraulic fluid that avoids formation of algae in the hydraulics associated with lifting mechanism . Thus selective actuation of lifting mechanism with remotely originating control signals causes a responsive rotational raising or lowering of elevating ramp and UUV without overly exposing the operator to danger. In accordance with this invention a suitable lifting mechanism could also be any of many different mechanical arrangements capable of rotating and elevating ramp from carriage other than the hydraulic lift mechanism described.

Referring additionally to elevating ramp includes an elongate conveyer assembly that guides and supports UUV during launch and recovery. Elongate conveyer assembly can be integrally formed with elevating ramp or can be bolted or welded onto or otherwise securely made a part of elevating ramp so that launch and recovery of UUV can proceed reliably without creating undue destabilizing forces and moments. Elongate conveyer assembly includes an inboard portion that extends from hinges along the length of carriage and an outboard portion that extends in the opposite direction from hinges . Two series of rollers inclined at an angle of about 45 degrees are mounted on the upper side of inboard portion and a motor driven center belt longitudinally extends from the inner end of inboard portion to the outer end of outboard portion along the bottom of elongate conveyer assembly . Motor driven side belts are supported in longitudinal guide structures that longitudinally extend on opposite sides of outboard portion and each side belt and separate guide structure are disposed in an aligned relationship with a separate series of inclined rollers .

Motor driven center belt and motor driven side belts are connected to appropriately connected belt drive motors not shown in assembly to selectively longitudinally displace central and side belts and in outward and inward directions. The belt drive motors are coupled to batteries and remote control interface module to respond to appropriate control signals received at interface module to couple appropriate amounts of power from batteries to each belt drive motor for selective actuation of belts and . This selective actuation can simultaneously displace belts and to carry UUV in either direction along the length of outboard portion of conveyer assembly during launch and recovery. When UUV traverses inboard portion center belt alone moves UUV along in this stretch of conveyer assembly .

Referring again to an electric powered winch is mounted on the end of elongate elevating ramp . Winch is coupled to batteries and interface module to reel out or reel in a high tensile strength line when appropriately controlled by remotely originating control signals . Line can be made from any of a considerable number of suitable commercially available fibers secured at its distal end to a coupling hook connected to a pad eye on the nose of UUV . Coupling hook can be selectively unlatched to an open position for example by tugging on an interconnected tether line . Winch and line are robustly made to selectively reel out and reel in line and handle the load of UUV when elevating ramp is elevated as described below during deployment and retrieval of UUV . Winch can be controlled by control signals to support the load of UUV as UUV traverses the length of elongate conveyer assembly during launch and recovery or can be appropriately controlled to share the load of UUV along with belts and .

Elongate conveyer assembly of elongate elevating ramp of system is sized to accommodate one size of UUV . Selective actuation of winch can deploy line connected to UUV and the appropriately spaced apart inclined rollers center belt and side belts can fit about this one size to guide it during launch and recover. Other smaller dimensioned UUVs would not be safely secured and the consequent loose fitting may allow jarring random motions and impacts that may affect reliability. In accordance with this inventive concept the process of launch and recovery of UUV is further improved upon by including an elongate sabot that is sized to fit against inclined rollers and side belts in an elongate abutting contact and fit against different sizes of UUVs to engage and carry UUV .

Referring also to elongate sabot has a pair of rigid hollow members defining a pair of elongate chambers . Rigid hollow members are laterally spaced apart to fit between and rest against or on inclined rollers and side belts while the bottom of UUV rests on center belt . Several lateral members are provided between rigid hollow members to hold them apart and maintain structural integrity while they rest on central belt . A number of bottom support members on both of members are contoured to fit against or accommodate the shape of the selected UUV . Contoured support members and lateral members cradle and support UUV on carriage and while UUV is being launched and recovered. A rigid upwardly extending frame is securely connected to hollow members on one end of sabot and positions and holds an air powered pressurized nose clamp . Nose clamp is shaped to fit against and be clamped onto nose portion A of UUV when appropriately actuated to be filled with pressurized gas. An air powered pressurized tail clamp having a pair of pivotable arc shaped members is provided at the opposite end of sabot . Arc shaped members are shaped to fit around and against tail portion B of UUV and be clamped onto it when appropriately filled with pressurized gas. When nose portion A of UUV is abutting against and held by nose clamp and arc shaped members are rotated closed in abutting contact to hold the tail portion B of UUV UUV is securely held and retained in sabot . This secure contact is needed for example during transport of UUV across support surface or during early stages of launch and later stages of recovery of UUV . When nose portion A of UUV abutting nose clamp is depressurized and arc shaped members are depressurized and rotated open to remove contact with tail portion B of UUV UUV can be free from sabot during for example the final stages of the launch of UUV .

In accordance with this inventive concept rigid hollow members lateral members contoured support members rigid upright frame nose clamp and arc shaped members of air powered tail clamp of sabot can be re dimensioned and re configured to accommodate and safely launch and recover a wide variety of different dimensioned UUVs.

Air powered nose clamp and air powered tail clamp are coupled to a pair of valve actuated pressurized gas tanks on carriage see also via gas supply lines not shown . Air powered nose clamp and air powered tail clamp are coupled to interface module on carriage to be selectively actuated by appropriate ones of remote control signals . Control signals from remote control cause control interface module to control the flow of pressurized gas from pressurized gas tanks to rotate nose clamp and arc shaped members of tail clamp closed to hold UUV in sabot during recovery for example or to rotate nose clamp and arc shaped members open to free UUV from sabot during launch.

Referring again to operation of launch and recovery system of the invention is initiated by a single operator generating control signals at remote control to bring a designated UUV from a storage bay at dockside or on an ocean going ship. Because launch and recovery system of the invention is compact and self contained it can be quickly air transported or carried by rail or truck from a remote supply depot to where it is needed without requiring ancillary equipment. The right UUV for the job can be mounted in sabot on carriage of system at the remote depot or system and UUV can be shipped separately and UUV can be mounted on system at the work site.

Launch of UUV systematically progresses in a controlled sequence schematically depicted in when taken in conjunction with the structure of launch and recovery system of . In operator appropriately operates remote control to emit appropriate control signals for control interface module to activate drive motors for wheel sets to propel and steer self propelled carriage across and to the edge of support surface on ship . UUV can be located on elongate conveyer assembly of elevating ramp to distribute at least some of its weight on opposite sides of hinge members to reduce the amount of force needed to rotate ramp conveyer assembly and UUV by lifting mechanism . Optionally UUV and sabot could be located further to the left on conveyer assembly and ramp as shown in as UUV is being transported across surface to the water s edge and when carriage arrives at the position shown motor driven belts and can be actuated to move sabot and UUV to the right on conveyer assembly on ramp .

Referring also to the next step in launch of UUV has lifting mechanism activated by control signals to partially rotate and incline ramp conveyer assembly sabot and UUV to the position shown. Line extending from winch through upright frame member of sabot and connected to pad eye on UUV via hook exerts a sufficient tensile force to prevent gravity from moving UUV down the inclined conveyer assembly . Frictional engagement of UUV by belts and also creates a frictional force to resist this downward motion and further holds UUV on conveyer assembly and ramp .

Launch of UUV preferably is done while ship is underway. This forward motion causes UUV to trail behind in the created current and UUV begins to be towed behind shift as sabot and UUV clear the outboard end of conveyer assembly and enter into water . While this is happening additional appropriate control signals received at interface module cause pressurized gas to be vented from pressurized nose clamp and pressurized tail clamp to release their constrictive engagement of nose and tail portions A and B of UUV . These additional appropriate control signals also cause pressurized gas to be vented from elongate chambers in rigid hollow members . Sabot is flooded with a portion of ambient water and sinks in water to a level that is below the slightly buoyant UUV as shown in . Since line is connected to UUV and passes through frame member the floating UUV and at least partially submerged sabot can be towed behind the stern of craft . Tether is pulled by operator or an additional helper see and hook unlatches to disengage from pad eye so that UUV floats free launched from ship see . Hook is dimensioned to be too large to pass through frame member . Therefore hook is pulled by line to abut against frame member to allow retrieval of sabot via line after UUV is launched.

Recovery of UUV systematically progresses in a controlled sequence schematically depicted in when taken in conjunction with the structure of launch and recovery system of . In a single operator on surface of ship positions the far end of a long handled pole adjacent pad eye on UUV . Unlatched or open hook is connected to line that has been passed through frame member of sabot . Hook is releaseably mounted on far end and is brought next to and against pad eye . Operator further positions hook to abut and press against pad eye so that an additional slight force will latch and engage them together for example or line can be pulled by operator to effect such engagement. In either case connection between line and UUV can be made by only one operator spaced a safe distance away from UUV on surface . Contrary to contemporary techniques the complete safe engagement of UUV by system of the invention is made without requiring anyone to be dangerously close by in the water as the UUV is bobbing in the water next to ship .

Referring to after connection of line to pad eye ship moves slowly forward to separate UUV from it and thereby greatly reduces the possibility of danger to personnel and damage during recovery of UUV . This separation reduces these hazards that have otherwise plagued recovery of UUVs using conventional retrieval procedures and contemporary equipment. Line is securely connected to pad eye via hook and UUV is towed to trail behind ship in an aligned fashion during its approach to frame member of sabot see . No unnecessary hazardous involvement of support personnel is called for with system of the invention.

With UUV and sabot in the water elongate conveyer assembly can be appropriately rotated to put elongate flexible metal strips on outer end of conveyer assembly at and below the surface of water . Line extending from motor driven winch through frame member of sabot and to pad eye on UUV is slowly wound onto winch to draw up nose portion A along and past strips and against upright frame member at outer end . Appropriate control signals received at interface module cause pressurized gas from tanks to be fed to elongate chambers of hollow members of sabot to blow out the water that had flooded them earlier during launch of UUV . The evacuated chambers float sabot upward to cradle UUV on lateral members and contoured support members . The buoyancy of sabot contributes to raise UUV and sabot to and through the water air interface and upward up the inclined conveyer assembly on ramp see . Control signals received at interface module also cause pressurized gas from sources to inflate and pressurize nose clamp and tail clamp to securely engage nose portion and tail portion A and B of UUV .

As line exerts tensile force sabot and UUV are pulled past outer end and up elongate conveyer assembly and onto belts and . Further reeling in of winch increases tension on line to pull sabot and UUV further up the inclined conveyer assembly on ramp . Additional control signals are sent by remote control to activate belt drive motors coupled to belts and to displace the belts in the direction that further helps to draw UUV upward out of water and along conveyer assembly . With line connected to UUV via pad eye and belts and frictionally engaging UUV and rigid hollow members sabot and UUV are pulled further up on outboard portion of conveyer assembly see until sabot is pulled from belts and onto longitudinally extending roller tracks of inboard portion of conveyer assembly see . As sabot and UUV make the transition from outboard portion to inboard portion they rest on and bypass the midway location of hinge members . As this transition occurs lifting mechanism can be actuated by appropriate control signals at interface module to rotate inclined ramp and conveyer assembly to the horizontal position. This positioning reduces the load on line and belt . Winch can continue to reel in more of line and belts and can continue moving until sabot and UUV are on inboard portion of conveyer assembly at the position shown in . UUV on carriage can be moved and steered across support surface to storage bay by the single operator to complete the entire recovery sequence without any assistance from other personnel or ancillary equipment.

Launch and recovery system of the invention is self contained and is compact enough to be air lifted or otherwise transported by truck or other convenient carrier from a far distant supply depot to a seaside or ocean location where it is needed. This feature allows system to be remotely deployed with or without UUV attached to enable timely launch and recovery by as few as one operator. In addition no ancillary support equipment is required other than a readily available source of electricity to recharge batteries or source of compressed air for filling tanks. Under dire operational scenarios carriage can be modified to include a suitable electric power generator and an air compressor to eliminate the need for any outside sources for such operations. Launch and recovery system of the invention for UUV is far safer and more effective as compared to the complicated and difficult to control support cranes and heavy equipment used in the manpower intensive launch and recovery procedures that have been followed for years. Launch and recovery system needs no other topside personnel or boatmen.

Modifications and alternate embodiments of launch and recovery system may be adapted and differently configured components could be used in the construction of system . In this regard all components can be made from a wide variety of materials and mechanisms to meet the requirements of strength and ruggedness for different applications. Modified designs for system of the invention using sophisticated corrosion resistant and non corrosive materials including composite materials can be readily made within the scope of one having ordinary skill in the art.

The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. However launch and recovery system as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting but rather is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept. It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
