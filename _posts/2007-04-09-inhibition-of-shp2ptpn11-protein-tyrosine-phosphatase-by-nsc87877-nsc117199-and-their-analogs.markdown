This application claims priority to currently pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60 744 431 entitled Shp2 Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Inhibitor filed Apr. 7 2006 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. CA077467 awarded by the National Cancer Institute. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates to cancer therapy. More specifically this invention relates to compounds useful in inhibiting Shp2 PTPN11 protein tyrosine phosphatase activity.

Shp2 encoded by the PTPN11 gene is a non receptor PTP with two Src homology 2 SH2 domains N SH2 C SH2 Alonso et al. 2004 Neel et al. 2003 . Molecular biology and genetic studies has shown that Shp2 mediates cell signaling by growth factors and cytokines such as epidermal growth factor EGF hepatocyte growth factor and interleukin 6. In particular Shp2 is involved in activation of Erk1 2 MAP kinase by EGF Deb et al. 1998 .

Shp2 is basally inactive due to auto inhibition by its N SH2 domain Hof et al. 1998 . In growth factor and cytokine stimulated cells Shp2 binds to tyrosine phosphorylated docking proteins through its SH2 domains resulting in its activation Cunnick et al. 2001 . It has been shown that Shp2 binds to Gab1 or Gab2 in cells stimulated with EGF HGF or interleukin 6 Cunnick et al. 2001 Gu and Neel 2003 Maroun et al. 2000 Nishida and Hirano 2003 . Gab1 Shp2 interaction as well as Shp2 PTP activity are necessary for Erk1 2 activation by these growth factors Cunnick et al. 2002 Neel et al. 2003 . While the mechanism by which growth factors activate Shp2 has been elucidated those by which Shp2 produces downstream signals to activate Ras Erk1 2 MAP kinase pathway and possibly other pathways are less clear and may be growth factor and cell context dependent Mohi et al. 2005 .

Besides its role in growth factor and cytokine signaling Shp2 has been implicated in pathogenicity of . Cytotoxin associated antigen A CagA positive strains of are strongly associated with gastritis and gastric cancer. After injected into host cells CagA is retained on the plasma membrane and recruits Shp2 to induce transformation of gastric epithelial cells Hatakeyama 2004 .

Remarkably PTPN11 mutations have been found in Noonan syndrome juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia JMML and several types of human malignancies Bentires Alj et al. 2004 Tartaglia and Gelb 2005 . Noonan syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by facial anomalies short stature heart disease skeletal defects and hematological disorders Tartaglia and Gelb 2005 . Germline PTPN11 mutations are responsible for causing 50 of cases of Noonan syndrome. Some children with Noonan syndrome also develop JMML Tartaglia et al. 2003 . JMML is a progressive myelodysplastic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by overproduction of tissue infiltrating myeloid cells. Approximately 50 of cases of JMML have activating Ras mutations or homozygotic inactivation of the NF1 gene that encodes a Ras GTPase activating protein neurofibromin. Somatic mutations in PTPN11 account for about 35 of JMML patients who do not have Ras or neurofibromin mutations Kratz et al. 2005 . It was reported recently that JMML associated Shp2 mutants could transform murine bone marrow and fetal liver cells Chan et al. 2005 Mohi et al. 2005 Schubbert et al. 2005 and caused fatal JMML like disorder in Balb c mice Mohi et al. 2005 . While molecular etiologies of Noonan syndrome and JMML are becoming clear several mechanistic issues regarding how Shp2 mutants cause Noonan syndrome and JMML remain unanswered. Importantly all Shp2 mutants found in Noonan syndrome and JMML are gain of function mutations mostly resulting from weaker autoinhibition of the N SH2 domain Fragale et al. 2004 Keilhack et al. 2005 .

In short accumulated molecular biology and genetic evidence has suggested that Shp2 is an important signaling component of growth factors cytokines and oncogenic bacteria. Gain of function Shp2 mutations are linked to childhood developmental disorder and juvenile leukemias. Therefore Shp2 PTP is an important target for controlling growth factor receptor signaling and a potential target for development of novel therapies for Noonan syndrome JMML and possibly other Shp2 associated cancers.

PTP inhibitor development is an emerging area in the field of drug development Bialy and Waldmann 2005 . Most efforts of PTP inhibitor discovery and design have so far been focused on PTP1B and Cdc25 inhibitors Lazo et al. 2002 Zhang 2002 . No systematic effort to identify Shp2 selective PTP inhibitors has been reported. While PTP1B inhibitors that cross inhibit Shp2 have been found Huang et al. 2003 Shen et al. 2001 none of them has demonstrated in vivo activity in cell cultures.

The present invention provides compounds and associated methods for inhibiting a protein tyrosine phosphatase. By a combination of experimental and virtual screenings of the NCI Diversity Set chemical library NSC 87877 and NSC 117199 have been identified as Shp2 PTP inhibitors.

Additionally a number of analogs of NSC 117199 have been produced. These analogs exhibit enhanced protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibition and are found to be potent inhibitors of Shp1 and Shp2.

Shp2 is a non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP encoded by the PTPN11 gene. It is involved in growth factor induced activation of mitogen activated protein MAP kinases Erk1 and Erk2 Erk1 2 and has been implicated in the pathogenicity of the oncogenic bacterium . Moreover gain of function Shp2 mutations have been found in childhood leukemias and Noonan syndrome. Thus small molecule Shp2 PTP inhibitors are much needed reagents for evaluation of Shp2 as a therapeutic target and for chemical biology studies of Shp2 function. By screening the National Cancer Institute NCI Diversity Set chemical library NSC 87877 was identified as a potent Shp2 PTP inhibitor. Site directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies suggested that NSC 87877 binds to the catalytic cleft of Shp2 PTP. NSC 87877 cross inhibited Shp1 in vitro but it was selective for Shp2 over other PTPs PTP1B HePTP DEP1 CD45 and LAR . Importantly NSC 87877 inhibited EGF induced activation of Shp2 PTP Ras and Erk1 2 in cell cultures but did not block EGF induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation or Gab1 Shp2 association. Furthermore NSC 87877 inhibited Erk1 2 activation by a Gab1 Shp2 chimera but did not affect the Shp2 independent Erk1 2 activation by phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate PMA . These results identified NSC 87877 as the first PTP inhibitor capable of inhibiting Shp2 PTP in cell cultures without a detectable off target effect. This provides the first pharmacological evidence that Shp2 mediates EGF induced Erk1 2 MAP kinase activation.

The NCI Diversity Set chemical library that contains 1981 compounds was screened for Shp2 PTP inhibitors using a GST fusion protein of rodent Shp2 GST Shp2 N . Confirmed hits 50 inhibition at 10 M that were either 1 organometallic agents 2 arsenic compounds 3 previously identified PTP inhibitors NSC 668394 NSC 5069 Lazo et al. 2002 4 potential carcinogens 5 with lower ICfor Shp1 than that for Shp2 in the initial analyses 6 a non specific protein binding agent or 7 polymers were excluded from further analysis. Authentic compounds of the remaining seven hits were either obtained from independent sources or synthesized in house and then compared to the samples from the NCI Diversity Set library for inhibition of GST Shp2. Only one of these compounds NSC 87877 showed a similar or greater potency than the sample of the same chemical identification obtained from NCI.

The PTP inhibitory activity of NSC 87877 was then assessed against several human PTPs in vitro. As shown in Table I NSC 87877 potently inhibited Shp2 with an ICof 0.318 0.049 M . NSC 87877 appeared to have no selectivity between human Shp2 and Shp1 in vitro. NSC 87877 showed approximately 5 24 206 266 and 475 fold selectivity for Shp2 over PTP1B HePTP DEP1 CD45 and LAR Table I .

NSC 87877 ranked among top 10 175 of the compounds with the best GLIDE scores for the docking to the human Shp2 PTP domain in our virtual screening of 2368 3D structures derived from the NCI Diversity Set. Computer docking of NSC 87877 suggested that the B ring sulfonic acid group forms hydrogen bond with the backbone NH group of Arg 465. Arg 465 is a conserved residue in the PTP signature motif motif 9 VHCSXGXGR T S G located at the base of the PTP catalytic cleft Andersen et al. 2001 . The A ring sulfonic acid forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain NHgroup of Lys 280 and the side chain NHgroup of Asn 281. Lys 280 Asn 281 are non conserved PTP residues located adjacent to the phosphotyrosine recognition loop motif 1 Andersen et al. 2001 . The interaction between aromatic rings of the compound and the protein contributes to the binding through hydrophobic stabilization.

NSC 117199 was docked to the catalytic site of Shp2 in the same way See . The docked structure along with the analog HL2 052 2 see Table II is shown in . This formed the basis of the design of the library of NSC 117199 analogs with the isatin core as shown in the compound Table Table II . The anionic goups on the isatin bind to the phosphate binding site of the PTP loop shown as the grey tube in and to Arg262 Lys364 and Lys 366.

To evaluate this molecular model we made two Shp2 PTP mutants containing changes in the Lys 280 and Asn 281 residues predicted to interact with NSC 87877. One Shp2V280 mutant contained a Lys 280 to Val 280 mutation and the other Shp2RD mutant contained dual Lys 280 Asn 281 to Arg 280 Asp 281 mutations. In silico prediction gave both Shp2V280 and Shp2RD mutants a 0.6 kcal mole increase destabilization in the GLIDE docking score. Sensitivity of mutated and wild type Shp2 to NSC 87877 inhibition was then compared experimentally by the PTP assay. As shown in Table I Shp2V280 and Shp2RD were approximately 3 fold less sensitive to NSC 87877 inhibition p 0.0015 for comparison of ICbetween Shp2 and Shp2V280 p 0.0062 for comparison of ICbetween Shp2 and Shp2RD . These data suggest that Lys 280 and or Asn 281 are involved in NSC 87877 binding to Shp2.

To determine if NSC 87877 is able to inhibit Shp2 in the cells serum starved HEK293 cells were pre incubated with or without NSC 87877 and then stimulated with EGF or mock treated. Shp2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and Shp2 PTP activity was then determined in the immune complexes using DiFMUP as the substrate. Shp2 PTP activity increased 2.6 fold in response to EGF stimulation in the absence of NSC 87877 pretreatment . Incubation of NSC 87877 alone reduced the basal Shp2 PTP activity by 45 . The EGF stimulated Shp2 activation was inhibited by 97 when cells were pretreated with 50 M NSC 87877 .

Molecular biology studies using overexpression of a PTP inactive Shp2 mutant have suggested that Shp2 is involved in EGF induced Erk1 2 activation Deb et al. 1998 . To evaluate if NSC 87877 could inhibit Shp2 dependent cell signaling in the cells we examined the effect of NSC 87877 on EGF stimulated Erk1 2 activation. Serum starved HEK293 cells were pretreated with 0 50 M NSC 87877 for 3 h and then stimulated with EGF for 5 min. Erk1 2 activation was determined by immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates with an anti phospho Erk1 2 antibody. As shown in NSC 87877 inhibited EGF stimulated Erk1 2 activation in a concentration dependent manner. A 50 inhibition of EGF stimulated Erk1 2 activation was observed at an average of 6 M NSC 87877 in two independent experiments.

It has been observed that expression of a chimeric protein Gab1PH Shp2 N consisting of the Gab1 PH domain and a constitutively active Shp2 N SH2 domain deletion mutant resulted in Erk1 2 activation and that the Shp2 PTP activity is necessary for Erk1 2 activation by Gab1PH Shp2 N Cunnick et al. 2002 . To examine if NSC 87877 could inhibit Shp2 dependent Erk1 2 activation that bypasses the ligand receptor interaction HEK293 derived cell lines dox G1S2 containing dox inducible Gab1PH Shp2 N were established using the Flp In T Rex 293 cells. top panel shows a representative dox G1S2 cell line that demonstrated the property of dox inducible expression of Flag tagged Gab1PH Shp2 N. In the absence of dox there was little residual level of Gab1PH Shp2 N in the cells and the level of active Erk1 2 was minimal. Induction of cells with dox induced Gab1PH Shp2 AN expression and Erk1 2 activation . However in NSC 87877 treated cells Erk1 2 activation by Gab1PH Shp2 N was inhibited. Coupled with data from this result suggests that the mechanism by which NSC 87877 inhibits EGF induced Erk1 2 activation is not mediated by events upstream of Shp2 such as activation of EGF receptor. Furthermore since there was no extracellular stimulation involved in the Erk1 2 activation by Gab1PH Shp2 N the observation that NSC 87877 could inhibit Gab1PH Shp2 N induced Erk1 2 activation indicates that the target of NSC 87877 is intracellular.

Previous studies have shown that PMA induced Erk1 2 activation is not affected by overexpression of a PTP inactive Shp2 mutant Yamauchi et al. 1995 suggesting that the protein kinase C PKC activator mediated Erk1 2 activation is Shp2 independent. We therefore compared the effect of NSC 87877 on EGF and PMA stimulated Erk1 2 activation. Consistent with data presented in EGF stimulated Erk1 2 activation was inhibited by NSC 87877 . In contrast NSC 87877 did not affect PMA induced Erk1 2 activation . PKC is known to activate the Erk1 2 MAP kinase cascade by directly phosphorylating Raf 1 Carroll and May 1994 Kolch et al. 1993 . Thus our data that NSC 87877 inhibited EGF induced but not PMA induced Erk1 2 activation suggest that the target of NSC 87877 is upstream of Raf 1 consistent with the notion that NSC 87877 is acting on Shp2 to inhibit Erk1 2 activation.

Shp2 is activated in EGF stimulated cells by binding to tyrosine phosphorylated Gab1 and Gab2 if it is also expressed Cunnick et al. 2001 . To further assess if NSC 87877 has an off target effect upstream of Shp2 activation in the EGF stimulated cells we analyzed EGF induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Gab1 Shp2 association in HEK293 cells treated with NSC 87877 and or EGF. HEK293 cells express Gab1 but not Gab2. shows that Gab1 was not tyrosine phosphorylated and Shp2 was not detected in Gab1 immunoprecipitates in the absence of EGF stimulation. Gab1 became tyrosine phosphorylated and Shp2 was co immunoprecipitated with Gab1 upon stimulation of cells with EGF. also shows that NSC 87877 did not inhibit EGF stimulated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent binding of Shp2 to Gab1. Immunoblotting analysis of cell lysate supernatants used for immunoprecipitation of Gab1 indicated that an equal amount of Shp2 was present in each sample bottom panel . These results indicate that NSC 87877 does not affect EGF activated signaling steps prior to Shp2 activation.

HEK293 cells express Shp2 but not Shp1. Since NSC 87877 inhibits Shp2 and Shp1 with the similar ICin vitro we next tested the inhibitory effect of NSC 87877 on EGF signaling in MDA MB 468 cells that express both Shp2 and Shp1. Near confluent MDA MB 468 cells were serum starved pretreated with NSC 87877 or solvent and then stimulated with EGF. Shp2 and Shp1 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and their PTP activities were determined by the immune complex PTP assay. Similar to that observed in HE 293 cells EGF induced Shp2 activation in MDA MB 468 cells and NSC 87877 inhibited the EGF induced Shp2 PTP activity in these cells . Shp1 immunoprecipitated from serum starved MDA MB 468 cells had a similar low basal PTP activity as that of Shp2. Interestingly EGF did not induce Shp1 activation in repeated experiments .

Paxillin is a physiological substrate of Shp2 Ren et al. 2004 . As shown in EGF induced paxillin dephosphorylation in MDA MB 468 cells which was inhibited by NSC 87877. Thus inhibition of Shp2 PTP activity by NSC 87877 in MDA MB 468 cells blocked dephosphorylation of its protein substrate in these cells demonstrating a direct functional consequence of Shp2 inhibition. Shp2 functions upstream of Ras in the Ras Erk1 2 MAP kinase pathway Neel et al. 2003 . To determine if NSC 87877 could inhibit Ras activation EGF induced Ras activation in MDA MB 468 cells was analyzed by the GST RBD pulldown assay. As shown in more active Ras was pulled down by GST RBD in EGF stimulated cells than that in serum starved cells indicating that Ras was activated in EGF stimulated cells. However if cells were pretreated with NSC 87877 EGF induced Ras activation was blocked . Consistently EGF induced Erk1 2 activation was inhibited by NSC 87877 in MDA MB 468 cells . Thus NSC 87877 can inhibit EGF stimulated Erk1 2 activation in MDA MB 468 cells that co express Shp2 and Shp1.

While molecular biology and genetic evidence has suggested that Shp2 plays important roles in growth factor and cytokine signaling and that Shp2 mutations are linked to human diseases chemical biology interrogation of Shp2 function and signaling mechanisms had not been possible due to the lack of a suitable Shp2 inhibitor. NSC 87877 has been identified herein as a potent Shp2 inhibitor and has been demonstrated to inhibit Shp2 PTP activity and Shp2 mediated Erk1 2 activation in intact cell models. This represents the first successful effort of identification of a Shp2 PTP inhibitor that is effective in inhibiting Shp2 dependent Erk1 2 activation in the cells. The present invention also provides the first pharmacological evidence that Shp2 PTP is involved in growth factor stimulated Erk1 2 activation. This important discovery opens a new avenue in Shp2 research by providing a novel tool for chemical biology exploration of Shp2 function and signaling mechanisms.

The in vitro PTP assays show that NSC 87877 inhibits Shp2 selectively over PTP1B HePTP DEP1 CD45 and LAR but it inhibits Shp2 and Shp1 with a similar potency. Development of a Shp2 specific inhibitor that does not cross inhibit Shp1 is a future aim. Nevertheless the present invention illustrates that a Shp2 PTP inhibitor without selectivity between Shp2 and Shp1 could still be a useful reagent for targeting Shp2 over other PTP inhibitors due in part to the differential expression of Shp1 and Shp2. Unlike Shp2 which is ubiquitously expressed Shp1 expression is limited to hematopoietic cells and certain epithelial cells. Furthermore Shp1 is epigenetically silenced in some leukemias and lymphomas Oka et al. 2002 . Shp1 PTP inhibition activity becomes irrelevant in cells that do not express Shp1 or contain a minimal amount of Shp1. While Shp1 negatively regulates cytokine and immune receptor signaling in hematopoietic cells the role of Shp1 in epithelial cells is less clear. Expression of exogenous wildtype or PTP inactive Shp1 in HEK293 cells was found to have little effect on the Erk1 2 dependent Elk 1 activation by EGF Bennett et al. 1996 . Interestingly the present data show that EGF activates Shp2 but not Shp1 in the MDA MB 468 human breast carcinoma cells. Thus even in certain cells where Shp1 is present it may not play a significant role in a particular signaling pathway. Under this condition a Shp2 inhibitor without selectivity between Shp1 and Shp2 can be used to analyze or control Shp2 function.

NSC 87877 contains two arylsulfonic acid groups one as naphthylsulfonic acid and the other as quinolinesulfonic acid. The arylsulfonic acid moiety has been identified as a pharmacophore of PTP inhibitors Huang et al. 2003 McCain et al. 2004 . In fact suramin a hexasulfonated polyaromatic naphthylurea and several polysulfonic derivatives of suramin that contain multiple naphthylsulfonic acid groups or phenylsulfonic acid groups are PTP inhibitors in vitro McCain et al. 2004 . Although negatively charged arylsulfonic acids were thought to be unfavorable for cellular uptake compounds containing multiple arylsulfonyl acid groups capable of entering cells are not without precedent. For instance suramin which has six arylsulfonic acid groups can enter cells through an active process Stein 1993 . Whereas the means by which NSC 87877 enters cells requires further investigation it is possible that it may not occur by passive diffusion but rather through an active process. Consistent with this notion we noticed that it was necessary to incubate cells with NSC 87877 for 2 3 h in order to observe the inhibitory effects of NSC 87877 in the cells suggesting that NSC 87877 cannot rapidly diffuse into cells.

Because of the similarity between Shp1 and Shp2 development of a Shp2 specific inhibitor will be challenging but not impossible. Selectivity between Shp1 and Shp2 either towards Shp1 or towards Shp2 was observed among several hits from the NCI Diversity Set chemical library our unpublished data . Shp1 and Shp2 catalytic domains are known to have different substrate specificity O Reilly and Neel 1998 suggesting that the catalytic cleft is not identical between Shp1 and Shp2. Furthermore the surface electrostatic potential of the catalytic cleft is much more positive in human Shp2 than in human Shp1 Yang et al. 1998 . The PTP catalytic cleft consists of a base and four sides in the 3D structures Hof et al. 1998 Yang et al. 2003 . Although amino acid residues present at the base of Shp1 and Shp2 PTP catalytic clefts are identical all four sides of the catalytic cleft contains one or more residues that are different between Shp1 and Shp2. These differences will provide the basis for developing an Shp2 specific PTP inhibitor in our continuing effort.

Recombinant PTP Proteins Plasmids for expression of glutathione S transferase GST PTP fusion proteins of human Shp2 residues 205 593 Shp1 residues 205 597 and PTP1B residues 1 435 were constructed in pGEX 2T by PCR subcloning techniques. A plasmid for GST fusion protein of human HePTP residues 1 399 was constructed in pGEX 2T KG. GST Shp2 PTP containing Lys 280 to Val V280 and Lys 280 Asn 281 to Arg Asp R280D281 mutants were generated by PCR based mutagenesis. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.

GST PTP fusion proteins were expressed in DH5 and affinity purified with glutathione Sepharose. After elution from glutathione affinity column GST fusion proteins were dialyzed with dialysis buffer 12.5 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5 25 mM NaCl 1 mM dithiothreitol DTT and 0.1 mercaptoethanol at 4 C. for 40 h and then stored in dialysis buffer plus 20 glycerol at 80 C. Recombinant CD45 residues 584 1281 and LAR D1 domain were obtained from Calbiochem. Recombinant DEP1 was from Abcam. GST fusion proteins of murine Shp2 GST Shp2 N and Shp1 have been reported Cunnick et al. 1998 Cunnick et al. 2001 and were used in the chemical library screening and initial in vitro characterization.

PTP Activity Assay PTP activity was measured using the fluorogenic 6 8 difluoro 4 methylumbelliferyl phosphate DiFMUP from Invitrogen as the substrate. Unless otherwise specified each reaction contained 25 mM MOPS pH 7.0 50 mM NaCl 0.05 Tween 20 1 mM DTT 20 M DiFMUP 10 nM Microcystin LR 20 nM GST PTP and 5 l test compound or dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO solvent in a total reaction volume of 100 l in black 96 well plates. Reaction was initiated by addition of DiFMUP and the incubation time was 30 min at room temperature. DiFMU fluorescence signal was measured at an excitation of 355 nm and an emission of 460 nm with a Wallac Victor1420 plate reader. ICwas defined as the concentration of an inhibitor that caused a 50 decrease in the PTP activity. For ICdetermination 8 concentrations of NSC 87877 at dilution 0.5 log were tested. The ranges of NSC 87877 concentrations used in each PTP assay were determined from preliminary trials. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and ICdata were derived from at least three independent experiments. The curve fitting program Prism 4 GraphPad Software was used to calculate the ICvalue.

Computer Docking Computer docking was performed using the X ray crystal structure of human Shp2 PDB identification code 2SHP Hof et al. 1998 using the GLIDE Grid Based Ligand Docking from Energetics as part of the FirstDiscovery Suite from Schr dinger L.L.C. program Friesner et al. 2004 Halgren et al. 2004 . The N SH2 domain of Shp2 which blocks the catalytic site was removed from the 3D structure prior to the computer docking analysis. The GLIDE program relies on the Jorgensen OPLS 2001 force field. The optimal binding geometry for each model was obtained by utilization of Monte Carlo sampling techniques coupled with energy minimization.

Preparation of HEK293 Cell Line for Doxycycline inducible Expression of a Gab1 Shp2 Chimera Plasmid pcDNA5 FRT TO Gab1PH Shp2 N was constructed by subcloning the coding sequence for Flag Gab1PH Shp2 N Cunnick et al. 2002 from pcDNA3.1 into pcDNA5 FRT TO Invitrogen through HindIII and ApaI sites. pcDNA5 FRT TO Gab1PH Shp2 N and pOG44 was then co transfected into the Flp In T Rex 293 cells Invitrogen . Transfected cells were selected in Dulbecco s modified Eagle medium DMEM 10 tetracycline free fetal bovine serum FBS medium containing 100 g ml hygromycin. Individual Hygromycin resistant cell lines were screened for dox inducible expression of Flag tagged Gab1PH Shp2 N by immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates with an anti Flag antibody M2 from Sigma . Among 24 hygromycin resistant cell lines that we have screened 21 cell lines showed dox inducible expression of Gab1PH Shp2 N. One of these 21 cell lines was randomly selected for use in the subsequent experiments.

Cells were lysed in ice cold PTP Lysis Buffer 25 mM Hepes pH7.4 150 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA 0.5 Triton X 100 1 50 diluted protease inhibitor cocktail Roche . Shp2 or Shp1 in cell lysate supernatants 0.5 mg each was immunoprecipitated with an antibody to Shp2 or an antibody to Shp1 Santa Cruz plus Protein A Sepharose for 2 h at 4 C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the PTP lysis buffer and twice with Reaction Buffer 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4 1 mM EDTA 5 Glycerol 1 mM DTT Tartaglia et al. 2003 . Each Shp2 or Shp1 immune complex was resuspended in 100 l Reaction Buffer containing 50 M DiFMUP and then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After a brief centrifugation supernatants were transferred into 96 well plates and the DiFMU fluorescence signal was measured. The remaining immune complexes were used for immunoblotting analysis of Shp2 or Shp1.
