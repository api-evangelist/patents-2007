title: Optical device and method of making the same using combination of light energy sensitive materials
abstract: A method of making optical devices includes applying an energy sensitive protective material and an energy sensitive advanced optical material to a surface. The surface can be on the optical device or on a carrier, such as a thin sheet, to be applied to the optical device. Light energy is applied through a special production filter to cure the energy sensitive protective material on the surface while blocking light energy outside a selected wavelength spectrum from reaching the material. A portion of the optical device can then be masked, and light energy outside the spectrum filtered by the special production filter can be applied to activate the unmasked portion of the advanced optical material. The special production filter allows curing of the protective material using light energy in a limited (e.g., visible) spectrum so that the advanced optical material can be activated using light energy in the ultraviolet spectrum.

This application relates to U.S. application Ser. No. 11 410 478 filed on Apr. 24 2006 titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SELECTIVELY ENABLING OR DISABLING AN OPTICAL DEVICE now U.S. Pat. No. 8 285 481 and U.S. application Ser. No. 11 656 932 filed on Jan. 24 2007 titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SELECTIVELY ENABLING OR DISABLING AN OPTICAL DEVICE USING OPTICAL BLOCKING MATERIAL ON AN ENERGY MASKED AREA OF THE OPTICAL DEVICE. now U.S. Pat. No. 7 830 777 These applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates generally to methods of manufacturing optical devices and in particular to methods of manufacturing optical devices having protective materials that must be cured and advanced optical materials that must be activated.

For the purposes of the present discussion an optical device may be any device or medium that relies on optics to function properly. Examples of optical devices include but are not limited to Compact Discs CDs Digital Video Discs DVDs High Density DVDs HD DVDs Blu ray discs and so on.

Systems and methods for selectively activating products are employed in various demanding applications including product theft prevention rental return enforcement and prevention of copyright infringement. Such applications often demand cost effective systems that are difficult to circumvent yet convenient to control with the appropriate equipment.

Systems for selectively activating products are particularly important in theft prevention applications involving readily shoplifted optical devices such as CDs and DVDs. Conventionally such optical devices are tagged with a theft prevention device such as a sticker or a Radio Frequency Identification Tag RFID that is deactivated upon purchase. When deactivated the devices prevent alarm triggering tag functions from triggering alarms when a customer exits a merchandise outlet such as a retail store.

Unfortunately thieves often readily notice and remove such tags. Furthermore RFID tags may undesirably increase product costs and may further emit undesirable radio frequencies even after deactivation. For example such frequencies may not be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration FAA for in flight use.

The related patent applications cited above describe systems for selectively enabling and disabling optical devices. In the latter application the optical blocking materials are applied to the readable surface of the optical device during production and are then activated by applying sufficient energy to change the optical blocking material from a non transparent condition into a transparent condition. The optical blocking material can then be masked and partially activated during production to reduce the energy required to fully activate the optical device later in retail or other supply chain settings.

Low cost scratch resistant lacquer or film based materials can be used as a platform to deliver functional materials to optical based products such as optical discs. Ultraviolet UV light is generally used to manufacture these products. The requirement for UV light in the manufacturing and printing process forces other wavelengths of light to be used for additional advanced optically sensitive materials. This leaves only the visible and infrared spectrums for activating optically activated materials allowing reading data storage and or security activation. Generally the infrared spectrum does not produce enough energy to rapidly activate optically sensitive materials. This leaves only the UV and visible spectrums to drive photonic reactions during manufacturing and product activation processes. Currently the UV spectrum is set aside in manufacturing for curing coating and printing of optical components. Therefore this leaves only the visible spectrum 400 to 750 nm wavelength for the function and or activation of optically activated materials. Unfortunately the visible spectrum cannot be used for products that might be activated or are intended to function in light emitting devices like a CD or DVD player. Furthermore materials that can be activated in the visible spectrum are often susceptible to sunlight damage.

The present invention accommodates using a combination of energy sensitive materials during production of an optical device with a first energy sensitive protective layer cured by applying light energy in a first filtered spectrum and a second energy sensitive advanced optical material activated by applying light energy in a spectrum outside the first filtered spectrum.

In one embodiment a method of making optical devices includes applying an energy sensitive protective material and an energy sensitive advanced optical material to a surface. The surface can for example be on the optical device itself or on a carrier such as a thin sheet to be applied to the optical device in a later production process. Light energy is applied to the energy sensitive materials through a special production filter to cure the protective material while blocking light energy that would activate the advanced optical material. A portion of the optical device can then be masked and light energy sufficient to activate the advanced optical material is applied to the unmasked portion of the advanced optical material. This method of using a special production filter allows curing of the protective material using light energy in a limited spectrum e.g. the visible spectrum and or part of the ultraviolet spectrum so that the advanced optical material can be activated efficiently and reliably in a later process step using light energy in another spectrum e.g. the ultraviolet spectrum .

According to one aspect the present invention provides a method of manufacturing an optical device comprising applying first and second energy sensitive materials having different properties to a surface and applying a first energy through a first filter to cure the first energy sensitive material while blocking energy that would activate the second energy sensitive material.

According to another aspect the present invention provides a method of manufacturing an optical device comprising applying first and second energy sensitive materials having different properties to a surface applying a first energy through a first filter to cure the first energy sensitive material while blocking energy that would activate the second energy sensitive material the first filter transmitting light energy in a first range of wavelengths while blocking light energy at wavelengths outside the first range of wavelengths and applying a second energy to activate the second energy sensitive material the second energy comprising light energy at wavelengths below the first range of wavelengths.

According to another aspect the present invention provides an optical device comprising a first energy sensitive material that has been cured to form a protective layer by application of a first light energy within a first range of wavelengths and a second energy sensitive material that can be activated by application of a second light energy within a second range of wavelengths and that is not activated by light energy in the first range of wavelengths the second range comprising wavelengths below the first range of wavelengths.

The present invention can be embodied in various forms including business processes computer implemented methods computer program products computer systems and networks user interfaces application programming interfaces and the like.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous details are set forth such as flowcharts and system configurations in order to provide an understanding of one or more embodiments of the present invention. However it is and will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention.

An optical device may be any device or medium that employs optical energy to function as desired. An optical device may include any optical disc employed to store provide and or manipulate data using selective application of optical energy. An optical device may employ a beam of optical energy for reading and or writing data to from the optical device. Examples of optical devices include but are not limited to CCD chips Compact Discs CDs CD Recordable CDR media CD Read Write CDRW media Blu ray Discs High Density HD discs Digital Video Discs DVDs optical memory cards credit cards Subscriber Identity Module SIM cards holographic based storage devices and any photon to electron transfer device.

The conventional optical device illustrated in has a lead in area containing the table of contents for the device a program area containing individual tracks with blocks of data and a lead out area . The lead in area must be accessible on the device to enable functional play. If the lead in area is not visible or is corrupted or partially blocked the device becomes unplayable. Unplayability can also be accomplished by blocking access to other parts of the optical device .

The conventional optical device in is coated by a scratch resistant protective material during the conventional manufacturing process. The protective material is typically a light energy sensitive lacquer material applied by a spin coating process so that it forms a thin coating over the read write surface of the optical device . After the protective material is spin coated onto the optical device the device undergoes a protective material curing process as illustrated in . In this curing process light energy from a light source e.g. a UV lamp is applied to cure the protective material . An infrared filter blocks infrared heat energy emitted from the light source from passing to the optical device to reduce disc skew. The UV and visible light energy that passes through the filter polymerizes the protective material and causes it to cure and or harden in a known manner.

In one embodiment of the present invention an optical device is coated with an advanced optical material and a protective material . The advanced optical material can be applied to the surface of the optical device and then covered with a protective material or the advanced optical material can be mixed with the protective material and applied as one combined material. The advanced optical material and protective material can also be applied to a thin optically transparent sheet that is applied to the optical device after curing as explained below in connection with another embodiment illustrated in . In all of these embodiments the advanced optical material is engineered with a composition that is only activated by energy in a specific wavelength range. For example the advanced optical material can be engineered to be sensitive only to UV light energy below 300 nm.

The advanced optical material can be an optical blocking material used to selectively enable and disable the optical device . As illustrated in the advanced optical material is applied to an entire surface of the optical device using a spin coating process or other suitable technique. As described in related application Ser. No. 11 410 478 the advanced optical material can be applied over or under the protective material layer or incorporated into the protective material layer . The advanced optical material can thus be integrated into the optical device in a variety of ways.

In the spin coating process the advanced optical material can be combined with the protective material and sprayed or poured onto the surface of the optical device . The optical device is then rotated at a high speed to spread the material by centrifugal force. Rotation is continued while the excess material and fluid spins off the edges of the substrate until the desired thickness of the combined material is achieved on the surface of the optical device . The thickness of the protective material and the advanced optical material can be controlled in a known manner by changing the rotation speed rotation duration and or concentration of the solution and solvent. Current spin coating equipment used in the manufacture of optical discs can be used to apply the advanced optical material and or the protective material .

The advanced optical material can be a photosensitive ink or dye and may be any ink or dye or other material that changes color or transparency in response to application of a specific energy. For example the advanced optical material can be an optical blocking material that can be applied in a thin layer which changes nature such as color or transparency in response to application of a specific energy such as optical energy vibrational energy or acoustic energy. Optical energy may be any energy within a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between and including ultraviolet and radio frequencies. In other embodiments energy other than optical energy may be employed to selectively change the transmissive properties of the advanced optical material .

The advanced optical material can comprise various types of ink azo ink or ink made by Veriloc Inc. without departing from the scope of the present invention. Other suitable inks include readily available CD R and DVD R recording dyes including cyanine and phthalocyanine azo dyes which are reactive to ultrasonic degradation in addition to optical degradation at specific wavelengths and intensities. Exemplary dies also include various types of recording dyes used for Write Once Read Many WORM discs and so on. Such dyes are relatively inexpensive and have characteristics that are suitable for use with embodiments of the present invention.

In one exemplary embodiment the advanced optical material is an optical blocking material that changes from an initial non transparent condition into a transparent condition upon activation. As used in the present application the terms transparent and non transparent are used to describe the relative transmissive properties of the advanced optical material in this embodiment in its activated and unactivated conditions. The term non transparent refers to any condition of the advanced optical material that prevents the optical device from being read or written to by an optical read system even if such condition has some limited transparency i.e. less transparency than the activated condition of the advanced optical material but not completely opaque . The term non transparent also includes a condition of the advanced optical material being partially reflective or exhibiting a specific color that prevents an optical read system from reading the optical device . The term transparent refers to the advanced optical material being sufficiently transparent or non reflective to enable an optical read system to read the optical device .

Once the protective material and the advanced optical material are applied to the optical device the device undergoes a protective material curing process as illustrated in . In this curing process light energy from a light source e.g. a UV lamp is applied to cure the protective material . A special production filter blocks light energy outside a predetermined wavelength range from passing to the optical device . In one exemplary embodiment the production filter transmits light energy in the wavelength range of 325 to 500 nm while blocking light energy having wavelengths outside i.e. above and or below that range. Thus for example the production filter blocks infrared light energy to reduce heat on the surface of the optical device that might lead to disc skew and or blocks UV light energy in wavelengths below a predetermined lower limit. The UV and visible light energy that passes through the special production filter cures and or hardens the protective material . The production filter can be made for example of heat resistant glass that incorporates one or more band pass cut off filters to limit light transmission to within the desired wavelength range.

Once the protective material is cured by the process illustrated in then the advanced optical material can be activated later in the manufacturing process and or before purchase by a consumer at a retail location. illustrates a subsequent process step for activating a selected area of the advanced optical material . In this process step a mask is used to cover part of the optical device . The masked area can be for example an area of the optical device that is necessary to enable functional play or another particular function of the optical device . For example the lead in area the file system s volume descriptor data path tables directory records or file descriptors on the optical device can be masked while leaving the remaining area of the optical device unmasked.

A sufficient energy is then applied to the unmasked area of the optical device to activate that portion of the advanced optical material while leaving the area under the mask unactivated. In this activating process light energy from a light source e.g. a UV lamp is applied to activate the advanced optical material . A standard infrared filter blocks infrared light energy from passing to the optical device to reduce heat on the surface of the optical device that might lead to disc skew. The infrared filter transmits both visible and UV light energy including UV light energy in the wavelength range below the range transmitted by the special production filter in . Thus the infrared filter transmits UV light energy in wavelengths e.g. less than 300 nm necessary to activate the advanced optical material .

In the specific embodiment described herein the advanced optical material is a photosensitive dye that has a non transparent condition until the material is activated by light energy having a particular wavelength or range of wavelengths at which time the material becomes transparent. The specific energy necessary to activate the advanced optical material will be determined based on the particular type of advanced optical material used which will determine the specific parameters of the special production filter . For example ultraviolet light infrared energy ultrasonic energy or vibrational energy can be used to activate certain types of advanced optical materials .

As illustrated by an optical device having an unactivated area of advanced optical material in a pattern of text can be formed by using a mask having the text pattern. For example the mask can be a circular or ring shaped adhesive label made of transparent material with printed text thereon. The printed text of the mask will block the light energy from the light source from activating the advanced optical material beneath the mask while the transparent material of the adhesive label will allow the advanced optical material in the area surrounding the text to be activated. The text pattern created by the mask can be made sufficient to stop functional play of the optical device while reducing the amount of material that must be activated later to enable the optical device . The smaller or special pattern of the unactivated area can be important for downstream activation i.e. to reduce time to activate reduce coverage of the device for exposure area and so forth . For another example the mask can be a reusable tooling component that is placed over the optical device while energy is applied to the unmasked area of the optical device . An activation system at a retail store or other supply chain location will be used to activate the remaining area of advanced optical material on the optical device to enable functional play. Once the area is activated the optical device can then be used in a normal manner.

Various embodiments of the present invention may provide important capabilities and features for merchants of various optical products such as CDs and DVDs. Such capabilities and features include simple and reliable one time activation at the point of sale extended exposure to direct sunlight will not activate the optical device activation time of 1 to 3 seconds at the point of sale can be achieved activation is possible by passing light through the product packaging including product cases the activation system is difficult to reverse engineer the system can be implemented cost effectively and the process will not degrade the long term performance of the optical device.

Those skilled in the art may construct advanced optical materials and associated activation equipment to selectively alter the chemistry of the materials to affect transparency or other activation features without undue experimentation. Additionally conventional systems for inducing changes in material chemistry may be adapted for use with embodiments of the present invention without departing from the scope thereof.

A subsequent applying step includes applying the advanced optical material to a surface or layer of an optical device such as a read write surface through which light must pass to enable effective operation of the optical device . The advanced optical material is applied in thick enough layers and or in sufficient concentrations to disable operation of the device .

Another applying step includes applying the protective material to the surface or layer of the optical disc . As explained above the protective material can be applied over the advanced optical material or it can be mixed together with the advanced optical material and applied together as a combined material. In this case steps and can be performed together.

After the advanced optical material and protective material are applied to the optical device light energy is applied in step through the special production filter . The special production filter transmits light energy sufficient to cure the protective material while blocking light energy that would activate the advanced optical material. This step corresponds with the process illustrated in of the drawings.

A masking step is then performed by placing a mask over an area of the advanced optical material that will prevent a function of the optical device . In a specific embodiment the mask is placed over the advanced optical material covering at least a portion of the lead in area of the optical device to prevent functional play of the optical device .

An energy applying step is then performed by applying a specific type of energy to the unmasked area of the advanced optical material . The energy is selected and applied at a sufficient intensity and duration to make the unmasked area of the advanced optical material change from a non transparent condition into a transparent condition. The energy applied in this step corresponds with energy that was blocked by the special production filter in step . This step corresponds with the process illustrated in of the drawings.

The mask is then removed and the optical device can be packaged and delivered to a retail store or other supply chain location as described in the related applications. The portion of the advanced optical material that was masked during the energy application in step remains in a non transparent condition at this time so that the optical device is disabled and less likely to be stolen or used before being properly purchased at the retail location. The optical device can be activated as needed at the retail location by applying a specific type of energy to the remaining advanced optical material that was masked during the earlier energy application step in the production process.

An electrical component applicator is then used to apply electro optic components to the thin sheet . The electro optic components can be for example tiny devices used to authenticate store information and or interact with disc playback writing hardware. The thin sheet with the layer of advanced optical material and protective material and the electro optic components carried thereon is then rewound onto a take up spool . The order of application of the materials and or components to the thin sheet can be varied to suit specific needs. Also it should be noted that the manufacturing process for the thin sheet containing additional materials and or components can be performed away from and off line of other portions of the optical device manufacturing process.

To avoid inadvertent sunlight activation and or damage caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight the advanced optical material and the electro optic components can be made so that they are only activated at wavelengths outside the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum e.g. 350 to 850 nm . For example the advanced optical material and the electro optic components can be designed for activation by UV light below about 300 nm.

At the optical disc manufacturing site the bulk sheet is unwound from the spool and disc shaped pieces are then punched from the bulk sheet in step . The disc shaped pieces are applied to a surface of the optical disc in step . A mask can then be placed over the optical disc in step and light energy applied in step to activate the unmasked portion of the advanced optical material.

The present invention provides a method to wavelength select at each manufacturing step to protect electro optical materials at current low cost production rates. For example the present invention allows manufacturing processes to take place using light energy in the visible spectrum and functional activation reading to take place using light energy in the UV spectrum to avoid sunlight activation influences. The present invention provides a manufacturing method that can be used to isolate and safeguard the optical energy range associated with additional advanced optically sensitive materials.

While embodiments herein are discussed primarily with respect to one time activation of an optical disc at a point of sale to prevent or thwart theft of the optical device the invention is not limited thereto. For example different materials or combinations thereof may be employed to enable multiple state changes for a given energy sensitive layer thereby allowing multiple activations and deactivations of an optical device. Multiple activations and deactivations may be particularly important in rental applications such as movie rentals where optical devices may need repeated activation and deactivation.

Although embodiments of the invention are discussed primarily with respect to systems and methods for inhibiting theft of an optical device by selectively enabling the optical device after purchase other uses and features are possible. Various embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative and not restrictive of the invention. For example energy sensitive inks in accordance with the present teachings may be employed to thwart copyright infringement and to produce optical based identity and banking products.

In the description herein numerous specific details are provided such as examples of components and or methods to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize however that an embodiment of the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other apparatus systems assemblies methods components materials parts and or the like. In other instances well known structures materials or operations are not specifically illustrated or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of embodiments of the present invention.

The embodiments of the present invention produce and provide systems and methods for manufacturing optical devices using a combination of energy sensitive materials. Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain embodiments thereof the invention may be variously embodied without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Therefore the following claims should not be limited to the description of the embodiments contained herein in any way.
