This application claims the benefit of the following provisional applications each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety 

U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 820 701 filed Jul. 28 2006 U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 825 885 filed Sep. 15 2006 U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 868 767 filed Dec. 6 2006 U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 869 899 filed Dec. 13 2006 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 914 298 filed Apr. 26 2007.

This invention generally relates to payment for products or services. The invention specifically relates to methods and systems that enable providing an alternate form of payment for products or services.

Existing systems for lead generation in advertising of products and services have drawbacks that either result in diminishing marginal return or inefficacy. Acquiring access to high quality leads that have a relevance to the product or service being advertised or promoted is considered of higher value than less relevant or random leads.

In addition on line response to advertisements offers and promotions continues to support increasingly higher levels of spending by advertisers and product or service providers for high quality leads. This has led to an increasing shift to online direct marketing from all segments of the marketplace. Recent annual spending in this segment increased substantially.

Meanwhile consumers continue to seek ways of acquiring goods and services such as software and other digital goods and services at lower prices or for free. In particular many consumers are not accustomed to paying for premium content and services online such as software publications games etc especially since there are many free alternatives. For many online goods and services especially digital products where the marginal cost of additional production is negligible or zero and the digital item is not tangible a fair economic value of these goods and services is hard for the consumer to quantify. This makes a traditional purchase decision difficult. Also there is a phenomenon of comparative taste that is the willingness of customers to pay for particular goods and services varies from customer to customer. One customer may be willing to pay full price for one item but unwilling to pay at all for another item while for a second customer the situation may be reversed. Thus the demand for a particular item reflects a distribution of prices at which particular customers are willing to pay for the item ranging from zero to the highest price that any single customer would be willing to pay. For goods and services with respect to which the marginal cost of production is negligible a merchant would ideally like to differentiate among these customers charging each one of them a price that reflects the extent of that particular customer s demand. This distribution of demand also results in merchants valuing different customers differently. A particular type of customer may be highly attractive to one merchant because that customer places a premium on that merchant s offerings while the same customer may not be attractive for another merchant because the opposite is true with respect to that merchant s offerings. Thus applicant has recognized that a need exists for methods and systems that allow merchants to provide an opportunity for customers with low willingness to pay to for one merchant s item to engage with other merchants advertisers for whom the customers have a higher willingness to pay for the alternate merchant items and visa versa. In this way both the original and secondary merchants benefit from the customer s differentiated tastes willingness to pay for one item over another .

A need also exists for methods and systems that facilitate gaining access to high quality leads by online advertisers and others who benefit from these leads and for allowing consumers to benefit from such access by participating in favorable offers for such goods and services. Stated from the perspective of the vendor there is a need to monetize non paying users who are unwilling to use traditional payment methods to access premium goods and services online and to establish an alternative payment mechanism that enables these users to barter other sources of value such as customer demographics not catered for in traditional payment methods.

Provided herein are methods and systems for alternative payments of products or services. An alternative payment platform as herein described may provide an advertiser with access to high value customers. The alternative payment platform may provide benefit to a wide range of markets such as online services online content providers software products shareware information services online retailers financial services publishers online games virtual goods and the like. For many online goods and services especially digital products where the marginal cost of additional production is negligible or zero the true economic value of these goods and services is hard for the consumer to quantify. This makes a traditional purchase decision difficult. In some cases an alternative payment method enables a customer to exchange a more tangible item for the intangible digital product. For example a customer looking to purchase an online subscription to a newspaper may instead elect to sign up for a weekly wine club at much greater cost since the value of the tangible goods i.e. wine is clearly quantified. An alternative payment platform may facilitate a product or service vendor receiving compensation for providing products premium goods or services to users who are unwilling to use traditional payment methods to access the premium goods and services. The alternative payment platform may also enable these merchants to exchange other sources of value such as customer demographics that are not supported in traditional payment methods for products premium goods or services.

The alternative payment platform may offer a high degree of scalability as it may be integrated with any type of e commerce transaction. The alternative payment platform may facilitate optimizing alternative payment offer selection for vendors. This optimization may be performed locally for each vendor. It may also be performed across a plurality of vendors associated with the payment platform such that the benefits of optimization may accrue to all parties associated with the platform.

The alternative payment platform may make readily available to users a substantial number of ways to pay for a product or service that are not available today. It may allow a user to directly receive value for engaging with a secondary offeror such as by trying or buying something from the secondary offeror or perhaps by simply providing his demographic and contact information in association with a product or service offering.

Terms such as merchant offeror vendor seller and advertiser are used herein to refer to any parties who engage in the business of offering goods products services or other items such as by sales leases licenses or other forms of transaction whether conducted by electronic commerce digital commerce offline commerce or other channels. Use of one such term should be understood to encompass the others except where context indicates otherwise. Without limitation of the foregoing the terms merchant and primary offeror are used in most cases herein to refer interchangeably to a party who offers a primary offer such as an offer to sell an item or bundle of items at a price or prices while the terms advertiser and secondary offeror are used interchangeably herein in most cases to refer to a party who provides an alternative to the primary offer. Such alternatives to a primary offer may include alternatives to provide the item of the primary offer upon different terms and conditions such as upon different payment terms or may refer to a completely different item from an unrelated merchant and are referred to herein interchangeably as alternative offers alternative payment offers and secondary offers. Terms such as secondary offer secondary offering alternative offer alternative offering alternative payment offer alternative payment offering alternate offer alternate offering discount offer discount offering and the like should be understood as various species of secondary or alternative offer and except where context indicates otherwise it should be understood that in various embodiments described herein one such species may be substituted for another resulting in additional alternative embodiments of the methods and systems disclosed herein.

Methods and systems are provided for providing an alternative payment platform including method and systems for providing a platform for presenting an alternate offer to a user who is engaged with a primary offer and receiving an indication of the user s engagement with the alternate offer wherein the user s engagement with the alternate offer serves as an alternative form of payment for an item associated with the primary offer. Such methods and systems may further include methods and systems for selecting one or more alternate offers engagement with which serves as an alternative form of payment for an item associated with a primary offer presenting the selected alternate payment offers to a user receiving an indication of engagement with at least one of the alternate offers receiving payment in exchange for presenting the accepted offer and providing payment to the offeror of the primary offer.

Referring still to the facilitator may optionally undertake various activities in managing the alternative payment platform such as searching for or identifying alternate offers managing the process by which advertisers are given the opportunity to present alternate offers to users such as by conducting a bidding process or the like analyzing various parameters associated with alternate offers such as to optimize the selection timing placement and the like of particular alternate offers to users presenting alternate offers to users such as in an ecommerce environment of the original merchant or in a different environment and facilitating the completion of the transaction among the user advertiser and merchant such as managing payment details fulfillment allocation of debits and credits handling of receipts prevention of fraud and other problems and the like .

Referring to a flow diagram shows certain actions that take place in the context of an alternative payment platform in one embodiment of an interaction of a merchant advertiser and user with a platform managed by a facilitator . At a step a merchant offers a primary offer such as offering an item at a price and a user initially engages with the primary offer at a step such as by viewing the merchant s presentation of the primary offer at the merchant s website in an email or the like. Meanwhile advertisers offer various alternate offers at a step . The facilitator analyzes the various alternate offers at a step . The facilitator undertaking various actions described in more detail elsewhere herein may select one or more alternate offers at a step . Upon selection at the step the alternate offer s may be presented to the user at a step . The user may respond to the alternate offer at a step and in one preferred embodiment may engage with the advertiser at a step such as by engaging in a free trial program with respect to another item purchasing another item or some other engagement such as providing personal information completing a survey or questionnaire registering interest and or a willingness to be contacted by advertiser regarding another item users various reactions to alternate offers being collectively referred to herein as a secondary offer communications . Subsequent to engagement of the user with the advertiser the facilitator may give the merchant a credit or payment at a step such as upon the facilitator s receiving an indication of the user s engagement with the alternate offer . At a step the user may receive the benefit associated with the alternate offer such as receiving the item on a discounted or free basis . At a step the facilitator may retain a benefit such as a credit fee or the like. At a step the advertiser may receive a debit or make a payment such payment debit obligation being optionally triggered by the user s having engaged with the advertiser the advertiser having the opportunity to present the alternate offer or other conditions .

Referring to additional details are provided with respect to optional components of an alternative payment platform and various actions that may optionally take place in the context of such alternative payment platform . Such components and steps may include a facilitator a primary vendor a secondary offeror a primary offer an alternate offer a debit and a credit . Upon notification by the secondary offeror that a user has engaged with the secondary offeror such as by accepting an alternate offer the facilitator may coordinate activities associated with authorizing delivery of an item associated with the primary offer and facilitating a credit . The secondary offeror may make available through the alternative payment platform one or more alternate offers for the user which with the assistance of the facilitator may be associated with the primary offer . The secondary offeror may accept engagement by a user such as acceptance completion of an alternate offer by a user and make a payment which may be retained in part and distributed in part by the facilitator . It should be noted that completion of an alternate offer may result from varying degrees of engagement with the alternate offer . For example completion may involve merely viewing the alternate offer taking an action required with respect to the alternate offer accepting the alternate offer such as thereby binding the user to undertake some action or other action specified by the secondary offeror with respect to the alternate offer . In a preferred embodiment the user may receive the item associated with the primary offer from the facilitator in exchange for engaging with the secondary offeror such as completing an alternative offer . In this case the user benefit described in and may be a one hundred percent discount or some other mechanism to allow the user to receive activate extend or make permanent his use of the item associated with the primary offer such as and without limitation for the activation extension or permanent use thereof. In embodiments the primary offer may encompass any and all products or services. Any and all references to a product may without limitation refer to a product and or service. Likewise any and all references to a service may refer to a product and or service.

An alternate form of primary offer may be an authorization for an adjustment in a purchase price of the primary offer . The adjustment may be immediate allowing the user to complete the purchase at a reduced price or it may be a reimbursement such as a rebate. In this way a user may choose to receive the product or service at a reduced price in exchange for completing one or more alternative payment secondary offers . The resulting purchase transaction may include a combination of an alternative payment and a traditional payment.

A facilitator may use a secondary offer consolidator to assist with identification and consolidation of alternate offers . Such a consolidator may be an advertising network manager an advertisement placement manager or similar party or may use or comprise a software based service for consolidating alternate offers and may act on behalf of the offerors with regard to the alternate payment platform . Such a consolidator may charge a fee for consolidating offers .

The primary vendor may make available a primary offer for download or other delivery to the user and may receive credit once the secondary offeror notifies the facilitator that the consumer has successfully completed one or more secondary offers . Such notification may be provided from the secondary offeror to the facilitator as a separate transaction or the notification may be encompassed in the debit . The facilitator pays the primary vendor an amount specified by the primary vendor or agreed by the primary vendor and facilitator . Upon delivery to the user of the item associated with the primary offer the primary vendor may notify the facilitator such that the facilitator may confirm that the user has received the benefit promised for engaging with the alternate offer .

The credit paid to the primary vendor may include a fixed portion related to a retail cost or other cost such as a minimum primary offer price. The credit paid to the primary vendor may include a variable portion related to a profit earned by the facilitator from debit by the secondary offeror . The variable amount may be based upon various factors such as the number of primary offers for which the facilitator has arranged alternate offers the economics associated with the alternate offers and the like or a percentage of the profit for example. The price paid may be based on an estimated profit an estimated debit an actual profit an actual debit and other estimated or actual financial factors associated with the alternate payment platform such as fees secondary offer consolidator charges and the like. The credit may be adjusted based on prior credits and actual financial factors related to the primary vendor primary offer user secondary offeror alternate offer other participants and the like. In an example a credit may be reduced because a prior credit paid to the primary vendor was based on an estimated debit that turned out to be higher than the actual debit .

The financial terms of an alternate payment transaction such as the credit to the primary offeror the debit to the secondary offeror the amount retained by the facilitator and the like may be determined by agreement between the facilitator of the alternate payment platform the secondary offeror and the primary vendor in advance of an alternate offer being presented. However the agreement may include variable pricing wherein the amount paid may be determined at the time the alternate offer is accepted such as during the user checkout process . This may allow a primary vendor to differentiate pricing based on attributes of the user such as geography consumers in low GDP per capita countries pay less for the product service than consumers in high GPD per capital countries or user credit worthiness consumers with greater propensity to select higher end offers will result in higher payments to the primary vendor than consumers who select lower end offers . The primary vendor may elect to adjust the amount to be paid by the alternate payment platform based on an aspect of the user .

The price paid may be based on an algorithm that may facilitate scalability of the platform. The algorithm may accept inputs related to the primary offer the primary vendor and the like. These inputs may introduce ambiguity such as default versus custom payments and margin based versus fixed dollar payments that may be resolved by logic associated with the algorithm. Aspects of offers and vendors may be classified to facilitate determining logic for resolving such ambiguity and for determining payment amounts. Offers may be classified as margin based payments that may automatically base the margin on economies associated with the alternate offer the secondary offer consolidator and the like.

In certain optional embodiments offers may be associated with margin based payments that include customization on an offer specific basis or fixed dollar payments which may also include customization on an offer specific basis. Vendor payment aspects that may impact the logic may be classified as a base case wherein no additional vendor criteria are required to determine the payment. Other vendor classifications include non standard aligned classifications wherein a primary vendor may define custom payment criteria while remaining aligned with an alternate offer related payment paradigm custom margins wherein a primary vendor defines a fully custom margin scheme that may be independent of alternate offer or secondary offeror related economies and flat payout fixed pricing wherein a primary vendor requires a fixed payment per transaction to facilitate avoiding impact on payments caused by other variables. These classifications are only exemplary and are not meant to be limiting. The algorithms logic classifications and other aspects of primary vendor payments should be considered extensible so that additional classifications may be introduced and supported. Resolution of the ambiguities herein described may be based at least in part on a rules table that may include offer parameters vendor parameters and the like. Additionally the platform may support fully customized payments that may be applied. Such customized payments may be configured to override or work in cooperation with the algorithms associated with payments.

Changes to primary vendor payment rules may be incorporated into the rules tables algorithms customized payments and the like. The following exemplifies one of many possible payment configurations.

In the previous table payment ambiguity is resolved by entries in the table such as when offer type 2 custom margin overrides vendor Big Co custom margin resulting in Big Co receiving 17 for offer 1 but only 15 for offer 2.

To facilitate an administrator of the platform or a vendor accessing the platform managing the payment algorithms logic rules and the like one or more of the following screens may be included in one or more interfaces of the platform payouts for all offers associated with a specific vendor payouts for all vendors associated with a specific offer configuration of vendor rules and parameters configuration of offer rules and parameters override screen triggered by a change to an offer e.g. a change to the offer classification override screen triggered by a change to a vendor e.g. a new vendor classification offer record screen to create linkage with one or more of these screens and vendor record screen to create linkage with one or more of these screens.

The payment module may record indications of events associated with alternate offers such as notifications that various activities have taken place respect to offers such as engagement with alternate offers acceptance of alternate offers approval of alternate offers where approval is necessary or completion of alternate offers such that upon occurrence of relevant events or activities each primary vendor may receive the credit herein disclosed. The vendor payment facility may perform a financial payment transaction to a primary vendor account such as and without limitation a bank account for an amount associated with any and all accumulated offer notifications. This financial payment transaction may occur upon offer notifications from time to time periodically and so forth.

The debit from the secondary offeror may include a fixed portion related to the alternate offer or related to the primary offer with which the alternate offer is associated. The fixed portion may be set by the secondary offeror or the facilitator . The debit may include a variable amount such as an amount based on the number of new users who complete an alternate offer with the secondary offeror . The variable amount may be based on a quality of the user completing the alternate offer . The quality of the user may include a user characteristic such as a user demographic. Commission based secondary offers may require an adjustable debit wherein the amount debited from the secondary offeror is calculated at the time the alternate offer is executed. A credit resulting from a commission based alternate offer may also be variably based at least in part on the commission of the alternate offer . The payment module may perform the calculations and issue the debit and credit accordingly.

The alternative payment platform may include a primary offer that may be coordinated by the facilitator and the primary vendor . The user may receive the ability to obtain access to the item associated with the primary offer such as receiving an authorization code a serial number product authorization key link to download an authorized copy of the product and the like upon completing an alternate offer . The user may receive an email instant message phone call fax or other communication from the facilitator or primary vendor with details on how to access retrieve activate and or make use of the primary offer .

To receive the authorization from the primary vendor the facilitator may request product authorization from the vendor by providing user information to the primary vendor to facilitate sending the primary offer . The information may include the user s email address first and last name unique customer id i.e. for additional tracking and so forth. The facilitator may also send the primary vendor product identification a random number a security code for validating the request for product authorization confirming the request is from the facilitator . The security code may be a SHA1 encryption of a concatenation of the random number the user s email address and a vendor security passkey. The vendor security passkey may be a unique identifier known only to the primary vendor and the facilitator . The primary vendor may specify this to the facilitator or the facilitator may provide this to the primary vendor separately from a product authorization request. The request for authorization may be provided in the form of a GET or POST command issued to a script such as a PHP or Perl script on the primary vendor s website for automatically generating the authorization. Such a script may create database or logfile entries of the command and authorization for purposes of record keeping.

In order to allow the facilitator to provide authorization to a user to allow the user to use the item associated with an alternate offer the primary vendor may provide to the facilitator information that allows access to the item associated with each primary offer such as a list of authorizations such as keys download links serial numbers registration codes login password combinations and the like and make this information known to the facilitator . Alternatively the secret information necessary to enable user authorization may be provided only to the facilitator . The facilitator may select one of the authorizations from the list of authorizations and automatically associate this with a user . The authorization may be communicated to the user in a variety of ways. For example the authorization could be delivered in an email or may be automatically be updated in an account created by the facilitator for the user such that the account can be securely accessed by the user on an as needed basis. In certain embodiments an email may be provided to the facilitator from the primary vendor after the primary vendor has customized it such as to include additional information that may be useful to the user such as a support email address a thank you from the primary vendor and the like. Alternatively the facilitator may customize the email for the primary vendor or may provide a standard email with the authorization to the user .

The user may be notified of the alternate offer in a variety of ways. The way of notifying the user may influence the likelihood of the user completing the offer . Therefore it may be beneficial to include a plurality of ways of notifying the user of the offer . However it may not be beneficial in that the user may disregard all subsequent offers after declining the first offer .

In embodiments processing notifications associated with an alternate offer may require a certain processing time such as may be associated with credit card approvals . In such cases the facilitator may with agreement from the primary vendor provide an initial authorization to temporarily extend the use of primary offer thus allowing time for the notification with respect to the alternate offer to be received by the facilitator and a final authorization to be sent to the user . This initial authorization may be associated with primary offers that have a limited use policy such as and without limitation a policy that would otherwise cause the primary offers to expire during the processing period. The following paragraphs describe a number of ways of notifying the user of the alternate offer .

A user may be notified of an alternate offer by receiving an email during the limited use phase of the primary offer . The email may be delivered to the user at or near the end of the trial such that the user may be inclined to continue using the product since the user may have already used the trial primary offer effectively. An email reminder at the end of a trial may help users on the fence to commit to a purchase. The alternative payment offer may provide a material incentive for those users to commit to an action sale.

A user may be notified of the alternate offer by an electronic communication. This communication may be rendered as a displayed message on a client facility of the user . In embodiments and without limitation the client facility may comprise a home computer a mobile computing facility such as and without limitation a PDA cell phone pager laptop computer and so on an automotive computing facility or in dash automotive display and so forth. The message may appear in a startup window also known as a nag screen that reminds the user that the product they are using is a trial or limited use version and they must pay for it or complete an alternate offer to continue to use it beyond the trial limit. It will be appreciated that all references to a webpage whether described herein or in the documents that may be included herein by reference may refer to any and all possible renditions of an electronic communication by a client facility for the user . A user may receive a notification that is associated with the alternate payment platform when the user uninstalls software.

In support of an email campaign or generally using email to inform users about the alternate payment platform and alternate payment options a user s activity that is associated with the email such as if or when an email is read may be tracked. Tracking a user activity that is associated with an email that is related to the alternate payment platform may be useful in managing continued email or other communication with a user . Such tracking may alert the alternate payment platform of when a user has read an email of how long the email was opened being viewed by the user of the geographic location of the user when the user read the email and so on. A commercial product such as didtheyreadit may provide such a tracking capability and may be associated with the alternate payment platform . Alternatively a tracking capability may be included within the alternate payment platform or may be provided by a third party.

Email tracking of alternate offers for example may facilitate the user accepting an alternate offer . By tracking a user s activity that is associated with the email it may be possible to make changes to further emails e.g. different email title different secondary offer different source email address and so on based on the tracked activity. As an example a user may read an email of an alternate offer within several hours of the email being sent. A follow up email that refers to the earlier email may be sent to the user implicitly making a connection for the user to their earlier experience of reading the earlier email. This may allow the alternate payment platform to tailor the follow up email to potentially improve the chances of the user accepting the alternate offer . A user that reads a tracked email and further interacts with the alternate payment platform to view additional alternate payment options that is alternate offers may be receptive to additional alternate offers .

A user may be notified of the alternate offer on the primary vendor payment webpage. This notification may be in lieu of or independent of a primary offer . The notice may be provided to the user as an alternate way of paying for the product even if they have not yet used the primary offer . In this way a user may elect to complete an alternate offer instead of using another form of payment at the time of purchase of the product. The notice may be presented to the user as a payment option similarly to other forms of payment such as a credit card or electronic payment option. In an example online video games may be for sale without a trial period. The alternative payment platform may enable users to select an alternate offer perhaps instead of or in addition to other forms of payment.

A user may be notified of an alternate offer as a result of a user navigating web pages of a primary vendor website. A user may use web browser navigation icons keyboard or mouse input or commands to open close display minimize or otherwise change the display of a web page of a primary vendor website navigate . A user may move a web browser pointer to be placed over a navigation selection as herein described including links within the web page. If the pointer remains over a navigation selection or link briefly an overlay image may be displayed notifying the user that the alternate payment platform may be accessed through the navigation selection or link.

Navigating through primary vendor web pages may result in an offer of the alternate payment platform being displayed to the user . The display may include a pop up web browser type window a redirection of navigation to a web browser window a confirmation window a balloon or other graphic image an audio message a video or animation display and any other type of visual or audible output intended to gain the attention of the user . The navigation resulting display may be transient being displayed briefly. It may require input from the user before the navigation is executed such as selecting among a plurality of navigation actions. It may require the user to confirm a navigation selection wherein canceling the navigation selection may allow a user to use the alternate payment platform .

In an example of web browser based navigation offer notification a user may be viewing a web page of a primary vendor website such as a primary offer description a primary offer purchase confirmation a primary offer shopping cart and the like. The user may select to close the web page by selecting the window close icon or other navigation selection as herein disclosed . Upon navigating to close the web page a confirmation window may be displayed. The user may be required to select among three options continue to close the web page cancel the navigation or review secondary offers through the alternate payment platform . Alternatively the user may be presented with one or more secondary offers among the navigation options.

The facilitator may facilitate the display of alternate offers in a multitude of ways herein called touchpoints in order to facilitate a transaction between the user primary vendor and advertiser . These touchpoints define the context in which the facilitator may display or otherwise present the alternate offers to the user and by which the user is encouraged to complete an alternate offer and receive a benefit such as receiving an item associated with the primary offer .

In another example a user may be viewing a web page of a primary vendor website and may enter a URL in the web browser address field. Upon detecting the address field change or when the user selects to navigate to the entered URL the web browser may display a notification such as a transition web page wherein the user may be asked to try the alternate payment platform to alternatively purchase an item associated with the viewed web page. The user may select to continue navigating to the entered URL or may try the alternate payment platform and navigate to a webpage associated with the alternate payment platform .

In another example a user may attempt to cancel the purchase of a primary offer by exiting the payment processing website of a primary vendor website or third party shopping cart for the primary vendor . Upon detecting that the user is attempting to cancel the purchase such as by hitting the back button in the browser or by navigating away from the shopping cart the web browser may display a notification such as a transition web page wherein the user may be asked to try the alternate payment platform to view alternative offers and alternatively purchase the primary offer by completing one or more alternative offers .

In another example a user may receive an email based on a previous interaction with primary vendor downloaded a trial version of the primary offer using the limited version of the primary offer etc. to try the alternate payment platform to alternatively purchase an item associated with the primary vendor .

In another example a user may attempt to fraudulently activate the fully functional primary offer . Upon detecting the attempted fraud the user may be prompted to view a notification such as a transition web page wherein the user may be asked to try the alternate payment platform to alternatively purchase the primary offer . The user may elect to try the alternate payment platform and navigate to a webpage associated with the alternate payment platform .

In another example a user may attempt to uninstall the trial version of primary offer . Upon detecting the product has been uninstalled the user may be prompted to view a notification such as a transition web page wherein the user may be asked to try the alternate payment platform to alternatively purchase the primary offer . The user may elect to try the alternate payment platform and navigate to a webpage associated with the alternate payment platform .

A webpage of a primary vendor website may include an alternate payment button or other selectable element that may be placed on the page with equal lesser or greater prominence than a buy button. In an example of greater prominence the alternate payment selection button may include animated graphics to attract a user s attention. Lesser prominence may include placing the alternate payment selection button at the bottom of the web page along side contact or other selections that are not payment related. Equal prominence may include placing the buy button and the alternate payment button side by side with similar visual impact. The alternate payment selection may be presented in a wide range of combinations of position and visual prominence that include the above examples and many others. The prominence of the alternate payment selection may be specified in a contractual agreement between a facilitator of the alternate payment platform and a primary vendor . The prominence may be selected to meet a certain marketing objective. The prominence may alternatively be based on an aspect of the user such as a user preference so that the alternate payment selection element is more appealing to the user . Independent of prominence selection of the alternate payment element may result in an alternate offer being presented to the user as an alternate payment option.

The navigation alternatives herein described may be performed by aspects of the web page being viewed such as HTML code or by other software executing on the user computing facility in association with the web browser such as a plug in applet browser menu or the like . Although a web browser is described for viewing web pages of a primary vendor web site other web page access and display software programs devices hardware and services may also be used to display and navigate the web pages.

A user may be notified of offers by configuring an RSS reader to deliver information related to primary offers or primary vendors being associated with secondary offers or secondary offerors . In this way the user may create a wish list of offer combinations and may be notified of published electronic information related to the combinations. The wish list may be created through a webpage of the alternate payment platform or through RSS reader software.

Alternative payment secondary offers may be associated with the primary offer the primary vendor or the user . A primary offer or alternate offer may be provided to a user based on user attributes such as demographics geo profile of comparable consumers and the like. Based on information the user provides to the facilitator or secondary offeror while completing an alternate offer the offer may be selected from an inventory of offers or dynamically generated. The offer may be based on a relevance to one or more user demographics such as age income address sex profession marital status and the like. The offer may be selected to maximize the overall profit of the transaction based on a conversion rate a payout amount and total volume of completed secondary offers from all vendors associated with the alternative payment platform and the like.

A secondary offeror may be an advertiser product supplier service provider market research firm non profit agency educational institution or any other entity that may benefit from a user engaging with the secondary offeror by completing an alternative payment offer . Since in certain optional embodiments the secondary offeror may only pay the facilitator for a completed alternate offer the secondary offeror can in such cases have some improved confidence that the information provided by the user is accurate since the same information may be used to provide the primary offer . The secondary offeror may also seek primary vendors with which they may establish cross promotional arrangements. They may also seek primary vendors with products that align with their own product objectives such that a user of the primary vendor product may have a greater likelihood of having an interest in the alternate offer .

The facilitator may solicit or receive from the users of primary offers recommendations or suggestions for items or services of interest to the users . Such recommendations and suggestions may also be provided to the facilitator by the primary vendor on behalf of the users . Additionally or alternatively the primary vendor may provide to the facilitator demographic and or preference data. In embodiments this data may be utilized by the facilitator in targeting secondary offers to users so as to increase conversion rates for the primary vendor . The facilitator may solicit primary vendors and or alternative payment secondary offerors for such items or services. The facilitator may coordinate the association of a primary offer with an alternate offer based on the suggestions or recommendations. The facilitator may seek new primary vendors and or secondary offerors to provide items or services based on the suggestions or recommendations.

The alternative payment platform may allow a primary offeror to reduce costs associated with product returns since the user has not made a monetary payment for the product such as if the return policy of the primary offeror is tied to the actual price paid by the user for the item associated with the primary offer .

An alternate payment platform may include an offer optimization facility which may select and or create an optimized offer . Optimization of an alternate offer may be based at least in part on one or more aspects of the alternate offer a secondary offeror a primary offer a user and timing associated with the alternate offer . An alternate offer that is not accepted by a user may not provide significant value to the secondary offeror primary vendor user or facilitator . Therefore secondary offers may be optimized so they are relevant to the user thereby increasing the likelihood of user acceptance.

Offer optimization may be based on an aspect of the alternate offer . The alternate offer may include aspects such as approval terms alternate offer cost to the user time to process an alternate offer age restrictions to accept the alternate offer residency requirements cancellation options and the like. One or more of these aspects may be combined so that an alternate offer may be optimized on a combination such as age restrictions and alternate offer cost to the user . In an example an alternate offer may be optimized based on approval terms. The approval terms of secondary offers may be evaluated to determine which alternate offer may provide the best approval terms. One alternate offer may require approval based on an on line credit scoring method that returns an approval decision to the user in seconds. Another alternate offer may require approval by an underwriting department that requires 10 days for an approval decision. In this example the alternate offer that returns an approval decision in seconds may be considered to be optimal as compared with the other alternate offer because a user is more likely to accept an offer with immediate feedback as compared with an offer that requires considerable time for approval. Offer optimization may also include combining one or more of these aspects with one or more aspects of the user facilitator primary vendor primary offer and alternate offer timing. Certain combinations are exemplified elsewhere herein.

In another example offer optimization may also be based on an aspect of the popularity of an alternate offer . Popularity optimization may be beneficial in that a more popular alternate offer is likely to be frequently accepted thereby providing value.

Optimization may be based on one or more aspects of a secondary offeror . The aspects of a secondary offeror for optimization may include cross marketing arrangements time for the secondary offeror to pay the facilitator amount the secondary offeror pays the facilitator for an alternate offer acceptance the number of potential secondary offers from the secondary offeror a traffic payout plan and the like.

Offer optimization based on aspects of the alternate offer may be related to offer optimization based on the secondary offeror . As an example a secondary offeror may provide a plurality of secondary offers . This plurality of secondary offers may be combinable so that payout tier traffic volume may be reached using a combination of alternate offer acceptances. A secondary offeror that permits combining secondary offers to reach a payout tier increased payout may be optimized above a secondary offeror that does not permit combining secondary offers . In this example the secondary offers of the secondary offeror that can be combined may be presented before other secondary offers .

An offer may be optimized based on an aspect of a primary offer . Aspects of a primary offer may include the class of primary offer the list or normal price the discounted price of the primary offer and the like.

An offer may be optimized based on one or more aspects of a primary vendor . Aspects of a primary vendor may include business affiliations between a primary vendor and a secondary offeror alternate offer preferences or restrictions the number of primary offers available to the alternate payment platform from the vendor a volume discount threshold and the like.

When primary offer aspects and primary vendor aspects are combined for optimization secondary offers may be selected that have a high relevance to a user of a primary offer and may more readily be accepted.

An offer may be optimized based on one or more aspects of a user . Aspects of a user for optimization may include demographics prior alternate offer acceptance history geographic region browser type internet connection speed receipt history prior transaction history and the like.

An offer may be optimized based on one or more aspects of timing. Aspects of timing for optimization may include time until expiration of an alternate offer duration of an alternate offer a difference between the time to deliver the primary offer and time to approve the alternate offer and the like. Optimization of secondary offers based on timing may include selecting an alternate offer that expires sooner than one that expires later since the later expiring alternate offer may be presented after the sooner expiring alternate offer expires.

An offer may be optimized to maximize revenue e.g. vendor revenue platform revenue to target users based on user demographics user behavior user interaction with the platform and the like. Offer optimization may be unique for each secondary offeror alternate offer secondary offer consolidator and other secondary offer related aspects such as offer terms offer timing and the like. Offer optimization may be dynamic so that it takes into account secondary offerors who may be approaching a pricing threshold associated with secondary offer payouts to the platform . Offers may also be optimized to generate the highest quality leads for secondary offerors .

The offer optimization facility may include access to one or more databases containing secondary offers preferences user transaction history demographics and the like. The results of an optimization may be stored in one or more of the databases delivered to the offer selection and display facility or both.

Offer optimization may include one or more algorithms to facilitate optimizing offers. Optimization algorithms may include heuristic optimization algorithms Markov decision processes ranking techniques steepest descent methods conjugate gradient methods and the like. In an example non gender neutral offers based on the gender of the user may be selected through a Markov decision process. Offers relating to women s clothing may be optimized to be presented to female users while offers relating to men s clothing may be optimized to be presented to male users.

Optimization may be performed locally for each vendor. It may also be performed across a plurality of vendors associated with the payment platform so that the benefits of optimization may accrue to all parties associated with the platform .

An aspect of the alternate payment platform may include an offer selection and display facility . The offer selection and display facility may match an offer or offers to a user match an offer or offers to a primary offer match an offer to an optimization result and the like. The offer selection and display facility may also present offers. The offers may be presented based on location based on an aspect of the offer based on a user preference based on a primary vendor preference based on an optimization result based on a secondary offeror preference and the like.

The offer selection and display facility may select a plurality of offers to be presented to a user based on the geographic location of the user . For example and without limitation a user located in the United States may be presented with a selection of offers that can be transacted in the United States while a user located in Canada may be presented with a selection of offers that can be transacted in Canada.

The offer selection and display facility may facilitate a user s viewing of any and all combinations of offers available through the alternate payment platform . When facilitating such viewing the offer selection and display facility may mark any and all offers that might not be valid for the user . This mark may involve italicizing text graying out text or graphics using an alternate visual representation to provide the offer and so on.

In another example the optimization facility may have optimized offers into a results list or group of optimized offers . The selection facility may first access this results list or group when selecting one or more offers to present to a user . The selection facility may apply selection criteria as herein described to the optimized results list or group of offers. The selection facility may present none some or all of the offers in the optimization results list with none or some other offers.

The selection facility may arrange the offers for presentation to the user so that optimized offers are presented first or more prominently than non optimized offers . In certain preferred embodiments optimized offers are presented in a list of offers rather than one by one.

The selection facility may facilitate presenting the offers in an order or prominence that is relevant to the user . In an example a user may instruct the selection facility through a user interface to arrange the offers so that the offers with the greatest relevance to the user are presented first or more prominently. To the extent that a user may be unknown to the alternate payment platform when offers are presented the user may enter relevant information that may be used in the selection of offers. For example the user may be presented a list of interest areas from which they could select one or more. The selection facility may use this information to identify and present to the user offers that are relevant to the user s interests.

Alternatively the user may select to register with the alternate payment platform so that each time the user accesses the platform the preferences interests and other information related to the user can be applied to offer selection by the offer selection and display facility .

The selection facility may include an interface to the optimization facility the payment module and other modules and facilities of the alternate payment platform as necessary. The selection facility may also include an interface to one or more databases containing offers preferences user transaction history demographics and the like.

In certain preferred embodiments the offer selection and display facility may further include web pages for presenting aspects of the offer and or the alternate payment platform . The web pages may include user interaction screens related to viewing evaluating selecting and responding to an alternate payment offer. The offer selection and display facility may allow a facilitator to associate new secondary offers with one or more primary vendors so that a user selecting to alternatively pay for the primary offer may select the associated new alternate offer . The association may be based at least in part on pricing of the offer geography and primary vendor preferences.

The offer selection and display facility may also provide alternate offer tracking so that a user will not see and cannot accept two related secondary offers . In an example a user may accept an alternate offer from Blockbuster from primary vendor A. Although the Blockbuster alternate offer is available from primary vendor B the user may not be presented the Blockbuster alternate offer through primary vendor B. In this way the user may not be presented offers that the user cannot accept and the secondary offeror does not have to deny the user s acceptance of the alternate offer . This may also maintain the image and integrity of the alternate payment platform .

Secondary offerors may provide variable payment for acceptance of an alternate offer based on the quality of the user engagement. An aspect of quality may be geography which may be represented by regional pricing. Offer selection as may be performed through offer selection and display facility may include regional pricing. Offer selection may be based at least in part on an aspect of the secondary offeror payment terms as they relate to geography. Aspects of secondary offeror payment terms that may affect payments to the platform may include the user location such as the user country county district postal code neighborhood town city street and the like. Offer selection with regional pricing may facilitate an administrator of the platform to quickly and clearly select one or more offers that meet the applicable pricing and geographic constraints.

Offer selection and display facility may include logic for selecting an offer based on location to support regional pricing. The logic may iterate through each user location associated with each potentially related offer and identify offers that target the user location e.g. country and have an expected payout pricing greater than the minimum acceptable price agreed to by the primary vendor for the primary offer . The logic may consider user location offer availability in the user location pricing of offer in the user location primary offer price and other factors associated with offer selection and display facility as described elsewhere herein. The logic may determine that an offer may not suitably meet selection criteria. In an example the minimum acceptable price that primary vendor has agreed to accept with respect to a primary offer that is presented to a user in the USA may be 8. In this case any offer yielding less than this amount to the primary vendor will not be displayed to the user .

A user interface associated with the platform such as the primary vendor interface the secondary offeror interface the facilitator interface and the like may include offer selection related input. In an optional example the platform interface may facilitate displaying offers based on a target user location an actual user location and the like. A user target location may include North America which may include the US mainland portions of Mexico Canada Puerto Rico and the like. Therefore targeting North America may display only those offers that are valid in the geographic regions associated with the target location. Offer selection may be based at least in part on pre defined offer groups as may be presented through a template that may be based at least in part on a vendor industry geography and the like.

The alternate payment platform may include a payment module . The payment module may facilitate transactions associated with payments related to the alternate payment platform . The payment module may maintain payment records. The payment records may be maintained permanently such as in one or more databases of the alternate payment platform . The payment module may track a user interaction with an accepted offer in such a way that the accepted offer is associated with a secondary offeror a primary vendor a user and a primary offer . The payment module may facilitate processing accepted offer approval notifications from the secondary offeror so that payments can be processed and a user can receive the primary offer . It should be noted that a variety of conditions may result in an offer being completed. In some cases any engagement by a user with the offer may be sufficient to complete the offer ranging from viewing the offer to accepting the offer to performing some action such as actually trying an item associated with the alternate offer . For example in one embodiment an accepted offer may exist once a user has completed data and payment entry and has agreed to all terms of an offer . An accepted offer may or may not require approval by the secondary offeror in order to be completed and in cases where approval is required the acceptance of the offer may or may not in fact be approved by the secondary offeror . Thus only some accepted offers require approval. Such may be the case for example for offers that involve user payments or credit approval. An accepted offer that requires approval becomes a completed offer once a secondary offeror approves the accepted offer. In some cases the secondary offeror may not approve an accepted offer and consequently the accepted offer may be vacated. In other cases any accepted offer is completed. It should be noted that while in some cases there is a distinction between accepted offers and completed offers in many cases an accepted offer a completed offer or an engagement by the user with the secondary offeror are equivalent in the methods and systems disclosed herein therefore references to each of these terms should be understood to encompass in various alternative embodiments the others except where context depends on the distinctions described here.

The payment module may process payments associated with offers of the alternate payment platform . To process a payment the payment module may include receiving notification or an indication of engagement by user with an alternate offer such as by accepting or completing an offer receiving notification of an accepted offer approval receiving electronic payment or record of electronic payment from the secondary offeror sending notification of accepted offer approval to the primary vendor sending electronic payment to the primary vendor sending payment to the facilitator and the like.

The payment module may process records associated with the primary vendor such as related profit earned by the facilitator number of accepted offers and accepted offer approvals associated with the primary vendor and the like to determine the fixed portion and or the variable portion to be paid to the primary vendor . The payment module may determine an amount owed to the primary vendor for each accepted offer or may determine the amount owed on an aggregation of accepted offers as often a once per hour day week or other time period. The payment module may record the primary vendor payment in a permanent record such as one or more databases of the alternate payment platform .

The payment module may facilitate processing a payment associated with a user . The payment module may send a payment to a user such as to a user s bank account or other electronic account . The payment module may receive payment from a user such as from a user s bank account credit card or other electronic account . The payment module may record the user payment in a permanent record such as one or more databases of the alternate payment platform . The payment module may facilitate processing both alternative payments as well as traditional payment processing such as with a credit card . In embodiments processing may facilitate a blended or hybrid payment with a component of traditional payment and a component of alternative payment. In such a blended or hybrid payment transaction the payment module may be used in a two part or multi part transaction thus in one part the payment is via a traditional payment method such as a credit card while in another part the payment is via the alternate payment platform . The payment module may send a payment to a user such as to a user s bank account or other electronic account .

In an example a primary offer may include a book. A user may be offered a promotion of a DVD version of the book in exchange for the user evaluating alternate offers via the alternate payment platform . Upon completion of an evaluation of the alternate platform which may include the user providing input and necessary user contact information the alternate payment platform may facilitate delivering the DVD to the user .

An alternate offer presented to a user of the alternate payment platform may be associated with this primary offer to develop a promotion that may include a DVD version of the primary offer book. The DVD may be provided to the user once the user has accepted an alternate offer . The DVD may be in addition to any product or service included with the alternate offer .

The alternate payment platform may include an offer bidding module . The offer bidding module may be associated with a secondary offeror through a secondary offeror interface an offer search module and other aspects of the alternate payment platform such as one or more databases. The offer bidding module may facilitate bidding related to secondary offers . Bidding may be useful in determining alternate offer placement in a presentation of secondary offers to a user . Bidding may also be useful to the alternate payment platform in selecting one or more offers to present to a user . Bidding may also facilitate optimizing secondary offers .

The bidding module may receive bids from secondary offerors that relate to specific secondary offers or that relate to any alternate offer from the secondary offeror . The bidding module may compare bids to facilitate ranking the bids and associated offers based at least partially on the bid amount. A bid may include a presentation amount to be paid upon confirmation of a placement to a user an acceptance amount to be paid upon user acceptance of the offer an approval amount to be paid upon approval of the user s acceptance of the offer and any other amount such as a marketing fee a transaction fee and the like.

Bid amounts may be based on quality of users accepting secondary offers volume of use acceptances and the like. In an example a user from a particular primary vendor may be significantly more affluent and thus have a greater ability to transact with a secondary offeror than a user from a different primary vendor. The secondary offeror may be willing to bid more for this user from the higher quality primary vendor .

The bidding module may process the bids including associating bids with secondary offers secondary offerors and the like for use by the offer search facility the offer optimization facility offer selection and display facility and the like. The bidding module may also store information such as bids bid history and the like in one or more databases of the alternate payment platform .

For example and without limitation a participant of the alternate payment platform such as a secondary offeror may place a bid with the bidding module to obtain a preferred placement of an offer in a presentation of offers to a user . The bidding module may determine that an aspect of this bid such as the amount of the bid enables the alternate payment platform to fulfill the preferred placement of the offer associated with the bid. Upon selection of the offer by the offer selection and display facility and presentation of the offer by the secondary transaction facility the offer would be presented to the user in the preferred placement. The preferred placement may include preferred presentation such as ranking in a list highlighting images font animation and the like that may differentiate this offer from other offers.

A secondary offer s placement preference may be affected by bid flexibility. Bid flexibility may be related to an alternate offer a secondary offeror or other elements of the secondary offer process. Bid flexibility may be specified when a bid is placed or may be based on a secondary offeror preference. Bid flexibility may include a maximum number of times the bid will automatically be increased kicks to keep pace with other bids. Bid flexibility may also include an amount per kick a total kick amount a maximum bid amount or any combination thereof.

A secondary offeror may specify the bid flexibility as a preference that may apply to all secondary offer bids placed by the advertiser. The secondary offeror may use the secondary offeror interface to specify bid flexibility preferences.

Secondary offers associated with highly flexible bids may be provided higher placement preferences. For example a bid with a 50 upside bid amount flexibility may be placed ahead of an identical bid with only 20 upside bid amount. In this way secondary offerors who are willing to spend more per secondary offer may be receive improved placement relative to other secondary offerors .

In addition to considering bid flexibility in alternate offer placement the performance of the secondary offeror and the alternate offer may be included in placement preference. It may be understood that a factor in the likelihood that a secondary offer will be accepted is a previous performance measurement associated with the offer. For example a secondary offer with a high number of acceptances from previous placements may be highly placed in a new secondary offer. Also a high number of alternate offer placements may improve the placement of future secondary offers from the secondary offeror .

Some factors that may affect a secondary offer s placement may also affect amounts debited from a secondary offeror that is associated with the secondary offer s placement. Factors such as click throughs user selections of secondary offers may indicate a relevance and or user interest in the secondary offer . Although a high or relatively advantageous placement of an alternate offer may be valuable to a secondary offeror engaging the user in further evaluation of the alternate offer may be of value even if the user does not accept the alternate offer . For example a user who clicks through selects an alternate offer may be presented with further details about the offer as well as other information that the secondary offeror may deem to be relevant. In this way the secondary offeror may gain the attention of the potential new customer. This may provide some measurable value to the secondary offeror .

The secondary offeror may be willing to pay a fee based on click through rates as measured daily weekly monthly or the like. The fee that the secondary offeror is willing to pay may be debited from the secondary offeror on a schedule based on a volume based on an event such as an alternate offer acceptance and so on. A debit amount may be associated with each click through and may be accumulated over time an accumulation interval may include hours day week month et cetera by the secondary transaction facility . The debit amount may be debited at least once per accumulation interval. Alternatively a secondary offeror may specify that click through debits may be accumulated and added to debits made for accepted offers.

In an example the alternate payment platform may receive a user request for an ecommerce transaction. The alternate payment platform may select a non monetary compensation offer through an automated ecommerce bidding process included in the bidding module . The alternate payment platform may present the selected non monetary compensation offer to the user .

The bidding module may be embodied as an automatic service such as and without limitation according to a service oriented architecture or any other computing architecture.

The bidding module may facilitate a secondary offeror bidding for alternate offer placement. The bidding module may interact with the primary transaction facility and other elements of the alternate payment platform such as user demographics user transaction history including alternate payment history one or more databases of the alternate payment platform the offer optimization facility and the offer selection and display facility and any other element as needed to facilitate offer bidding.

The bidding module may compute a consumer score for a user seeking to alternatively purchase a primary offer . The consumer score may be useful in facilitating offer bidding. To compute the consumer score the bidding module may assess information related to the primary offer and the active user . The bidding module may receive information about a primary offer transaction from the primary transaction facility . The information may include the primary vendor primary offer and the user . The bidding module may retrieve the user s transaction history from one or more of the databases of the alternate payment platform . The bidding module may also retrieve the user s demographics . The bidding module may combine the information about the primary offer the user transaction history and the active user demographics to compute the user s consumer score. In an example an user may be seeking to alternatively purchase a subscription to Zagat.com. The user s transaction history may show the user accepted secondary offers for three previous transactions with an average alternate offer user cost of 75. The user s demographics may indicate the user s address as an upper middleclass suburb of Boston Mass. Based on this example user information the bidding module may compute a consumer score as eight points out of a possible ten points. The bidding module may present this consumer score to a plurality of secondary offerors through the bidding module so that the secondary offeror may bid to present an alternate offer to the user . The consumer score may refer to one or more defined characteristics of the user . A high consumer score may be a strong indication of that particular user characteristic while a low consumer may represent an absence of that particular characteristic. The consumer score may be an aggregation of multiple similar consumer scores relating to different characteristics of the user . Furthermore these scores may be valued differently by secondary offerors such that one secondary offeror may pay a premium for a particular score while another secondary offeror will not. In this way a secondary offeror can bid on the consumer scores that best relate to type of user the secondary offer seeks to attract. In this document consumer score refers to an individual consumer score relating to a particular characteristic of the user or an aggregation of consumer scores that may be refer to the overall characteristics of the user and may be the weighted sum of the individual consumer scores.

A secondary offeror may place multiple bids for multiple different consumer scores relating to various aspects of a user . For example a secondary offeror may place a bid for high consumer scores relating to the female gender and may also place a bid for high consumer scores relating to high household income.

Some or all of the plurality of secondary offerors may bid to offer the user an alternate offer . The secondary offerors may adjust a bid amount based on the consumer score of the user . For example a secondary offeror may bid 20 to offer an alternate offer to an user with a consumer score of four. However the same secondary offeror may bid 50 for an user with a consumer score of eight. The secondary offerors may also include a conversion rate associated with a bid where the conversion rate is a measure of the likelihood that a secondary offer associated with the bid will be completed by the target user associated with the bid . An expected value based on a function of the bid and the conversion rate may be computed by the bidding module for each bid received. The secondary offeror bid rate expected value and alternate offer information may be shared with the optimization facility . Alternatively the expected value may not be computed by the bidding module . Instead the optimization facility may compute the expected value.

Through the bidding module computation of a consumer value for the user and the secondary offerors placing bids and associated conversion rates for the user the optimization facility may now optimize among secondary offers each with a computed expected value. Offer optimization may be directed toward maximizing the expected value that may be shared with the primary vendor for the user transaction. To maximize the expected value of a user transaction the offer optimization facility may rank the offers based on expected value so that the offer selection and display facility may select the top ranked offers for prominent presentation to the user . In an example the table below shows bids and conversion rates of six secondary offerors for the user with a consumer rating of eight ten in the example above.

The offer optimization facility or the bidding module may compute the expected value as shown in the table and forward the Cingular and the RealRhapsody offers as optimized offers to the offer selection and display facility . The selection and display facility may select one or more of the optimized offers and send them to the secondary transaction facility as selected offer s for presentation to the user . The remaining four offers may not be presented to the user unless the user rejects the Cingular and the RealRhapsody secondary offers . However the remaining four offers may be presented to the user along with the Cingular and RealRhapsody offers in a less prominent way such as by smaller print lower order in a list and the like. The bidding module may provide real time feedback to the secondary offeror as to the potential impact in offer performance that may result from an increased bid. For example a message may be sent to the secondary offeror indicating that an increase of a given amount will make a particular alternate offer the highest ranked offer on a page.

The alternate payment platform may include an offer search facility . The offer search facility may communicate with aspects of the alternate payment platform such as a bidding module the offer optimization facility the offer selection and display facility various databases of the alternate payment platform external offer databases and the like. The offer search facility may comprise search techniques such as text string matching to identify one or more offers from a plurality of offer databases . Searching by the offer search facility may be performed as a result of an event or a request. A search event may include receiving a user request for an ecommerce transaction such as acquiring a primary offer using the alternate payment platform . A search event may be a vendor registering with the alternate payment platform a vendor introducing the alternate payment platform to a new primary offer or a new alternate offer a user rejecting all offers presented through the secondary transaction facility a schedule such as a date and time and the like. The search request may include any participant including a user of the alternate payment platform sending the alternate payment platform a request to perform an offer search.

The offer search facility may maintain a directory of offer databases . Vendors and facilitators may provide input to the directory so that new offer databases may be searched by the search facility . The search facility may search through specific offer databases such as those in the directory. Additionally the search facility may also search throughout a network such as the internet for offers or offer databases that have a relevance to the alternate payment platform .

Changes to offer databases may be provided to the offer search facility through a variety of notifications. In an example an RSS feed of updates to one or more of the offer databases may be monitored by the search facility .

The offer search facility may also include information provided by bidding module in identifying offers for possible presentation to users .

The offer search facility may also receive a request from the offer selection and display facility to retrieve one or more offers from one or more of the offer databases . Upon receiving the request the offer search facility may access the appropriate offer databases retrieve the offer and present it to the offer selection and display facility for use in a presentation to a user for example.

In an example the alternate payment platform may receive a user request for an ecommerce transaction. The offer search facility may search a plurality of databases for non monetary compensation offers to be presented to the user as further incentive to complete the transaction. The offer search facility may retrieve at least one non monetary compensation offer from the plurality of databases and present it to the user through the alternate payment platform .

This acceptance may result in the secondary offeror associated with the secondary offer paying the alternate payment platform a fee for providing the lead.

The lead generation facility may match one or more aspects of an offer to one or more aspects of a user so that the offer may appeal to the user .

The lead generation facility may be embodied as an automatic service such as and without limitation according to a service oriented architecture or any other computing architecture

The alternate payment platform may include external offer databases . The external offer databases may be accessible by the alternate payment platform through the offer search facility . The external offer databases may be configured as a collection of records stored in one or more computers in a systematic way so that a computer program such as the offer search facility consult it to find offers. However any collection list single entry or other logically related group of offers may comprise the external offer databases .

One or more of the external offer databases may be established and or maintained by the alternate payment platform . This may be used as a primary store of offers by the alternate payment platform or it may be a backup or secondary store of offers.

An external offer database may be established and or maintained by a vendor such as a secondary offeror or an offer consolidator . The database may be maintained such that from time to time offers may be added removed or changed. The addition removal or change of an offer in one or more of the external offer databases may result in a signal such as an RSS feed being sent to the alternate payment platform .

In addition to offers being stored in an external offer database the alternate payment platform or a vendor may also store information related to offers such as bid amounts payment terms account numbers contact information offer performance user acceptance information and the like. Including this additional information in one or more of the external offer databases may facilitate communicating the information between a vendor and the alternate payment platform . In an example the offer search facility may retrieve an offer and associated information as herein described from an external offer database for processing by the offer optimization facility .

External offer databases may be distributed and or duplicated to facilitate timely searching and retrieval of information in the databases. In an embodiment including a plurality of alternate payment platforms information may be stored in the external offer databases to facilitate coordination of access among the alternate payment platforms . Alternatively the alternate payment platform may coordinate access separately from the external offer databases .

The alternate payment platform may include user demographics . User demographics communicate with aspects of the alternate payment platform such as offer optimization facility offer selection and display facility vendor reporting and the like. User demographics may be stored in a database that may be accessible to the alternate payment platform at all times. The user demographics database may be external to the alternate payment platform and may be established and or maintained by a user demographics provider. Alternatively the alternate payment platform may establish and or maintain a user demographics database.

When a category filter and or a country filter is selected the list of offers may be filtered to display only secondary offers that meet the filter criteria.

A user may select one of the secondary offers in the list as shown in . Within the list the selected offer may display relevant information graphics logos and other content associated with the selected offer to facilitate a user identifying the offer and or the secondary offeror .

As shown in when a user selects a selected offer a new web browser window displays a confirmation of the offer and a link to the secondary offeror website. While the specific example of indicates the link will direct the user s web browser to the secondary offeror website the link may direct the user s web browser to a website of the alternate payment platform such as a website managed by a facilitator . In this way the alternate payment platform may offer vendors secondary offerors and users the flexibility and options to interact and administer secondary offers in a variety of ways.

In embodiments an alternative form of payment may comprise a user s participation as a buyer and or seller in an online auction venue. For example and without limitation the seller may utilize a camera system to capture an image of an item for sale. Receipt of this image at the online auction venue may constitute the alternative form of payment for an item wherein the item may or may not encompass a promotional item offered by an owner operator affiliate et cetera of the online auction venue. Many other applications of a camera system in association with an alternative form of payment will be appreciated and all such applications are within the scope of the present disclosure.

Facilitating secondary offerors reaching high quality users may be a valuable service of the alternate payment platform . Secondary offerors may be looking to acquire high quality users to increase the likelihood that such a user will become a customer of the secondary offeror . Determining which users are high quality may be challenging in an electronic commerce environment because users can make a transaction including accepting a secondary offer without providing key quality information such as spending habits product preferences and the like. A user s email address and contact information while required for most transactions may not facilitate quality determination. In an electronic transaction such as an alternative payment transaction users may also be reluctant to provide personal details.

The alternate payment platform may offer alternative ways for secondary offerors to gain access to high quality users . By establishing a customer acquisition marketplace also referred to herein as a customer marketplace the alternative payment platform may facilitate a secondary offeror gaining access to high quality users through the platform s dynamic alternate offer association features. The alternate payment platform may allow secondary offerors to specify aspects of user quality that can be assessed by the platform . User quality may include aspects of primary offers . Therefore secondary offerors may request their secondary offers be offered to users who are alternatively purchasing products or services with specified aspects. For example and without limitation a user who is interested in a primary offer that involves purchasing a luxury good may be a user that is ready to spend a relatively large amount of money. In this respect the user may be considered a high quality user. For another example and also without limitation a user who is interested in a primary offer that is generally associated with a particular demographic may be considered a high quality user to a secondary offeror who is a purveyor of goods that are typically purchased by members of that demographic. Many definitions of a high quality user will be appreciated and all such definitions are within the scope of the present disclosure. Similarly many systems and methods of determining whether a user is a high quality user will be appreciated and all such systems and methods are within the scope of the present disclosure.

In embodiments there may be many secondary offerors interested in acquiring users who are alternatively purchasing one or more of the primary offers with the specified aspects. Therefore the alternate payment platform may enable secondary offerors to request promotion placement pricing and the like collectively referred to herein simply as placement of their secondary offers to high quality users . Such placement may be associated with positioning one alternate offer in relation to another alternate offer providing one alternate offer instead of another alternate offer modifying a look feel price or other element of an alternate offer such as and without limitation to improve the appearance and or allure of one alternate offer as compared with another and so on. Secondary offerors may include a bid in association with an alternate offer placement request. The offer bidding module may determine which alternate offer is selected based at least in part on the bid. In an example credit card vendors such as Discover Card VISA Master Card and the like may be willing to pay more to acquire a customer alternatively purchasing a Zagat.com subscription than a customer alternatively purchasing WinZip perhaps because the purchase of a subscription to Zagat.com as opposed to a purchase of WinZip naturally leads to additional purchases such as for restaurant visits for which using a credit card may be a preferred method of payment. Additionally or alternatively such a customer i.e. a user may have income or spending habits that would highly benefit a credit card vendor. This aspect of the alternate payment platform which a customer marketplace may encompass may allow secondary offerors to bid on users who are performing live alternative payment transactions rather than soft leads.

To facilitate the customer marketplace the alternate payment platform may allow secondary offerors to specify aspects of primary offers that indicate that a user who is selecting the primary offer might be a high quality user . The secondary offerors may specify these aspects through one or more screens dialogue boxes webpages et cetera of the secondary offeror interface . Aspects of the primary offer may be associated with specific products or services. In other examples a home equity lender may consider a user alternatively purchasing replacement windows as a high quality customer a horse transportation vendor may consider a user alternatively purchasing a saddle as a high quality customer a wine club may consider a user alternatively purchasing a case of wine to be a high quality customer. Many other such examples will be appreciated and all such examples are within the scope of the present disclosure.

Aspects of primary offers may also include categories or types of products or services. It will be appreciated from the foregoing examples that the products or services may be included in categories such as home improvement products or services horse riding and care products or services wine and liquor products and services and so on. Additional category examples may include gaming products or services camping products or services travel product or services boating products or services and the like. It will be appreciated that primary offers may be categorized or typed in a wide variety of ways that may be usefully specified by secondary offerors to identify potentially high quality customers. All such categories types and combinations of aspects are contemplated by this specification and are within the scope of the present disclosure.

Aspects of primary offers related to customer quality and the secondary offeror s specification of these aspects may be processed by the offer optimization facility such that the optimized offer selection incorporates these additional factors. Offer selection as performed by the offer selection and display facility may also be affected by these factors. A possible outcome of incorporating these additional factors into offer optimization and offer selection is a presentation by the secondary transaction facility of secondary offers that may have a greater relevance and possibly greater value to the user than other secondary offers .

In addition to the customer acquisition marketplace being useful and beneficial to secondary offerors it may also be beneficial to primary vendors . Primary vendors may view the possible associations with secondary offerors as adding value by providing co marketing and or co branding opportunities. Primary vendors may perceive that participating in the alternate payment platform may increase their sales through these offer associations and therefore the primary vendors may employ the alternate payment platform to provide an alternative payment option for their products and services. A user that is a high quality customer to a secondary offeror may also be a high quality customer to a primary vendor . Therefore if a primary vendor is aware that a user may be able to buy the primary vendor s product or service by alternatively purchasing a product or service alternate offer that the user highly desires the primary vendor may want to participate in that offer association. These offer associations thereby make the alternate payment platform a viable effective and desirable method of purchase for primary vendors .

Demographic and other user aspects that factor into a consumer s value to a vendor may include zip code and may relate to property value. These user aspects may be implicitly determined based on location detection of the user through the ISP and or IP address. The user aspects may be explicitly determined based on user provided data such as zip code. For example a user may provide a zip code that when evaluated against demographic data is considered a high approval rate zip code for financial products such as loans credit cards and the like. A credit card company may be willing to pay a relatively high fee to acquire a customer from a high approval rate zip code.

Third party services that provide on line access to property value income assessment approval rate and the like may provide valuable information for determining customer quality to the alternate payment platform . For example and without limitation an area with relatively high property values may contain higher quality value customer and therefore an advertiser may be willing to pay a premium to acquire a customer from such an area.

Similarly an aspect of a user s house home apartment may factor into customer quality value. A user in an apartment may not be a high quality value customer for secondary offerors that provide home improvement products and services. However such a user may be quite valuable to insurers that are offering apartment insurance. Therefore determining whether a user lives in an apartment home or other type of domicile may allow the alternate payment platform to establish an appropriate quality value factor for the customer.

Other factors such as a customer s i.e. a user s use of a particular type of internet connection a particular type of web browser a particular operating system and the like may also be of value in establishing the quality value of the customer. For example a secondary offeror offering faster internet access may consider a user with an out of date operating system e.g. Windows 98 as a low quality potential customer. Conversely a user with a current model computer an updated operating system and a slow internet connection may be considered a high quality potential customer. Many other examples will be appreciated and all such examples are within the scope of the present disclosure.

From the secondary offeror s viewpoint having timely access to high quality customers who are actively performing electronic transactions may provide much greater value than traditional internet advertising and marketing techniques such as cost per click keyword based marketplaces.

The alternate payment platform may allow a user to establish a transaction account with the platform . Associated with a transaction a user may provide relevant information such as a username password or other information only known to the user that the platform may use to identify the user . A transaction account may be associated with the relevant information and established for the user . The user transaction account may be credited with transaction credits each time a user completes an alternate payment transaction with the alternate payment platform . The transaction credits may be redeemable by the user in association with an alternate payment platform transaction. The transaction credits may be provided to the user as a reward for an alternate payment transaction and may provide an incentive for the user to use the alternate payment platform again to redeem the transaction credits accumulated in his transaction account.

The transaction credits may be based on an aspect of the transaction or aspects of the transaction account. The amount of transaction credits may be based on an aspect of a primary offer and or an alternate offer transacted through the alternate payment platform . Aspects of the offers may include the normal cost of the primary offer the cost to the user of the alternate offer the primary offer category or type the primary vendor the secondary offeror and the like. Aspects of the transaction account may include a total number of transactions a number of transactions within a predetermined timeframe a frequency of transactions a calculation of the total amount of primary offer normal costs and the like. Some examples of crediting user credits include one transaction credit for each primary transaction one transaction credit for each one dollar of primary offer normal cost one offer credit for a first transaction with a primary vendor and the like.

Transaction credit redemption may be controlled based on aspects of the transaction account the primary offer or the alternate offer . Redemption may be permitted only after a minimum number of transaction credits have been accumulated. Redemption may also be permitted only on certain primary offers . While example controls and restrictions are described herein it will be appreciated that many other types of controls restrictions limits minimum balances and the like may be applied to offer credit redemption. However redemption may be permitted without these or other limitations. In any case all such controls restrictions limits minimum balances and the like are within the scope of the present disclosure.

Transaction credits may be redeemed toward the alternative purchase of a primary offer . Such redemption may facilitate customer retention and satisfaction for the alternate payment platform . A user may accumulate transaction credits in his transaction account and may redeem the accumulated transaction credits when making an alternative purchase. In an example a user may have accumulated ten transaction credits in his transaction account. The user may select to purchase a subscription to Men s Health magazine using the alternate payment platform . If each transaction credit is worth one primary offer normal cost dollar and the subscription costs ten primary offer normal cost dollars then the user may purchase the magazine subscription using the ten accumulated offer credits. If the magazine subscription costs more than ten dollars the user may need to pay the difference or select an alternative payment alternate offer to cover the difference. If the magazine subscription costs less than ten dollars the user might receive the magazine subscription and keep the difference between the magazine subscription cost and the transaction account transaction credits balance in his transaction account.

It will be appreciated that transaction credits and primary offer normal cost may have different value relationships than the examples herein. For example a transaction credit may equate to one half of a primary offer normal cost dollar. Transaction credits may alternatively not have a regular relationship to primary offer normal cost dollars such that a primary offer may be assigned a fixed number of transaction credits independently of the primary offer normal cost. Any and all relationships between primary offers primary offer normal costs and transaction credits are within the scope of this disclosure.

Transaction credits used to alternatively purchase a primary offer may impact a primary vendor s financial accounting with the alternate payment platform . For example and without limitation transaction credits may be used to offset platform participation fees charged to primary vendors . A financial agreement between a primary vendor and the alternate payment platform may include the primary vendor accepting a predetermined number of transaction credits in lieu of payment based on a quantity of primary offers transacted through the alternate payment platform . For example and without limitation a primary vendor may accept transaction credits in lieu of payment for two primary offers for every one hundred paid primary offers. Use of transaction credits for alternatively purchasing a primary offer may facilitate customer retention for the primary vendor as well as the platform . Therefore such an arrangement may be mutually beneficial to the primary vendor and the platform .

Additionally the amount paid by the alternate payment platform to the primary vendor for an alternative purchase of a primary offer may be different than the primary offer normal cost. Therefore the value of the offer credits as perceived by the user may be different than the value perceived by the primary vendor or the alternate payment platform . This difference may also vary from user to user region to region country to country and so on. For example a user in the United States may perceive a value relationship between transaction credits and primary offers that is different than what a user in India perceives.

Transaction credits may alternatively be redeemed for secondary offers . Because secondary offers may require the user to purchase a product or service transaction credits may be redeemed to offset some or all of this cost. A secondary offeror may accept transaction credits as payment toward an alternate offer and thereby reduce the amount charged to the user to purchase the product or service of the alternate offer . The secondary offeror may accept the transaction credits without impacting an amount it pays the alternate payment platform to facilitate the secondary transaction. In this example the alternate payment platform debits the secondary offeror the amount it pays independently from the use of transaction credits.

An alternative accounting of transaction credits used to transact an alternate offer may include the alternate payment platform reducing the amount debited from the secondary offeror based on the number of transaction credits applied. A potential benefit to the alternate payment platform for this reduction in debit amount may be an increase in the number of alternate offer transactions with a secondary offeror such that next tier pricing for secondary offers may be reached sooner than if the reduction in debit were not employed.

Any combination of the above transaction credit accounting techniques and any other accounting technique related to transaction credits being applied to secondary offers whether described herein included herein by reference or appreciated are within the scope of the present disclosure.

Users who have established transaction accounts with the platform may have a higher value to a secondary offeror than users who do not have an account because information associated with the user account may facilitate targeting offers to the user .

The alternate payment platform may also facilitate micro payments. Micro payments may encompass low value electronic transactions that do not provide much residual value to a vendor after transaction fees such as and without limitation credit card fees of 2 plus a fixed transaction fee are deducted from an amount charged to the customer. A common example of a micro payment is an on line purchase of a song file. Song files cost as little as 0.99 yet credit card fees and operating costs for the transaction may substantially eliminate any profit that might otherwise be derived from the 0.99.

The alternate payment platform may facilitate micro payments by providing the vendor with 100 of the micro payment charged to the customer without imposing transaction fees. The alternate payment platform through the debits charged to a secondary offeror for facilitating an alternate offer associated with a micro payment alternative purchase may receive cash compensation in excess of the micro payment. This allows the alternate payment platform to pay a primary vendor the full micro payment and still make a profit. In this way the alternate payment platform provides a significant benefit to the user e.g. who receives a free primary offer that is provided in association with the user s acceptance of an alternate offer the secondary offeror e.g. that receives the user s acceptance of the alternate offer and the primary vendor e.g. that receives the full micro payment for the primary offer . It will be appreciated that due to the elimination of the transaction fee that might normally be associated with the micro payment the primary vendor may make a greater profit than in a standard transaction.

By combining transaction credits accumulated in a user s transaction account with micro payment alternative purchases the alternate payment platform may further provide benefits to users and primary vendors . For example and without limitation a user may redeem accumulated transaction credits for free song files a primary vendor may benefit from reduced fees by accepting transaction credits while receiving 100 of micro payments and so on.

A method of payment may be substituted to facilitate completion of a transaction such as a primary offer transaction or an alternate offer transaction. The method of payment may be associated with the primary offer primary vendor secondary offeror platform user environment payment facilitator involvement offer consolidator involvement combinations of above and the like. The method of payment may be associated with the offer such as the primary or alternate offer based at least in part on the type of offer the fulfillment method the environment of the offer e.g. on line versus point of sale and the like. In an example a primary offer that is presented and or fulfilled electronically such as a download of software may require electronic payment of any amount due from the user . An offer that is made and transacted at a point of sale may allow cash checks and other physical forms of payment. Similarly the method of payment may be associated with the vendor such as the primary vendor or secondary offeror . A vendor may require a prepayment to establish a credit balance that may be used for future transactions. In an example a ring tone vendor may require a prepayment of a minimum amount to complete a transaction. However the user may elect to use a portion of the prepayment to purchase a ring tone as part of the transaction and reserve the remainder of the prepayment in a credit account with the vendor for future purchases of ring tones and the like.

The method of payment may be based at least in part on the user environment which may include user preferences user computing device user network type user credit worthiness user purchase history user account status with the vendor or the platform and the like. In an example a user with good credit may be offered to defer payment until a later time while fulfilling the offer requirements at the time of the transaction. In this way the vendor provides credit to the user perhaps as a motivator for the user to accept the offer. In another example a user may accept an offer to pre pay for ring tones through a website of a vendor however the user s cellular phone account may be charged the pre payment amount and future transactions against the prepaid balance may be made through the website or the user s cellular phone. In another example a mobile phone user may accept to purchase an alternate offer of an upgrade to a mobile service plan as alternate payment for an upgraded phone. The user may complete the transaction by talking with a customer service or sales office of the mobile service provider and the payment for the service upgrade may be charged to the user s credit card mobile phone account deducted from a credit balance of a user account with the mobile service provider and the like.

The method of payment may be associated with a payment facilitator or offer consolidator . The method of payment may be based at least in part on aspects of the payment facilitator or offer consolidator . A payment facilitator may support other types of payment such as contingent payment deferred payment third party payment co payment and the like. In an example a payment facilitator may facilitate receiving payment from a user that is contingent on another event such as a user selling an item on an auction website e.g. E Bay or U bid . The payment facilitator may receive direct payment from the purchaser of the user auctioned item and based on the payment meeting contingency criteria facilitate payment to the vendor such as through the platform to complete the offer. The payment facilitator may deduct certain fees for facilitating the transaction from the amount received through the auction. In addition to selling an item on an auction website any other sort of contingency may be used such as a tax refund an insurance payment an annuity a social security payment a bank deposit a security transaction and the like.

The method of payment for an alternate offer may differ from the method of payment for a primary offer . The method of payment may be associated with and based at least in part on aspects of the secondary and primary offers. An alternate offer may include a discounted price for the primary offer resulting in the user making a reduced payment for the primary offer . The user may also make a payment for the alternate offer . The user method of payment for the primary offer may in such a situation be different than the user method of payment for the alternate offer . There may also be differences between the methods of payment accepted for the primary offer and those accepted for the alternate offer . In example and without limitation certain payment types may be possible for a primary offer such as cash a personal check a credit card payment a debit card payment or a gift card payment but other methods such as a PayPal transaction bank transfer and the like may not be available as options for an alternate offer payment. In this example payment for an alternate offer may be possible by using any of the aforementioned payment types including those methods not available for primary offer payment. In this way a user may specify a different source of payment for the alternate offer than may have been possible for the primary offer . In another example a user may indicate a different source of payment for the alternate offer even if identical payment types are available for both primary and alternate offers . The alternate offer may include the user receiving a credit balance such as a gift card that is useable for the primary offer . In an example a user may receive a reduced price for the primary offer by completing the alternate offer and may further receive a gift card associated with the alternate offer that may be used to further reduce or completely pay the reduced purchase price for the primary offer . In this way a user may use a credit card to purchase the alternate offer and may use the gift card to purchase the primary offer . The gift card may be provided by the secondary offeror an offer consolidator the platform and the like. The gift card may be provided simply for the user completing the alternate offer transaction or it may be provided when the user provides contact information for a friend to the secondary offeror offer consolidator and the like. There are many other conditions that may be associated with a user receiving a gift card or other credit and all are within the scope of this disclosure.

In addition to the method of payment being substituted the currency exchange transactions associated with a transaction may occur away from the transaction. The currency used for payment of the alternate offer may differ from the currency used to express pricing of the alternate offer . Exchange of the currency may occur as part of a financial transaction between the payment provider e.g. a credit card or bank and the vendor platform payment facilitator or the like. However the transaction may complete independently of the currency exchange. In an example a user may purchase an offer expressed in US dollars. At a later time or through another transaction the vendor platform payment facilitator and the like may cause an exchange of the transaction currency for a currency associated with the vendor platform payment facilitator and the like. For a given alternate offer expressed in a particular country s currency a user may indicate that payment may be made using a different currency the same currency or a combination of currencies. In an example and without limitation a user located in the United States may select an alternate offer from a British entity where the pricing is indicated in British pounds. In this example payment for the alternate offer may be made using the United States dollar. In a later or separate transaction the US dollars associated with the alternate offer transaction may be exchanged for British pounds by the vendor payment facilitator offer consolidator and the like.

Vendors may participate in a referral system associated with the platform . A vendor may be a referrer or a referee in a referral relationship with another vendor. A referee may have been referred to the platform by a vendor of the platform . A referrer may have referred a vendor to the platform . A vendor may receive compensation for referring another vendor to the alternate payment platform . In an example and without limitation a first vendor may refer a second vendor to the alternate payment platform . The second vendor revenue that is associated with the platform may be a basis for compensating the first vendor. The compensation to the first vendor may be based on a percent of the second vendor revenue. Alternatively referral compensation may be graduated. The graduation may be based on a number of transactions an amount of revenue a number of referrals and the like. In an example and without limitation a primary vendor may receive a 5 referral commission for the first 1000 transactions made by the second vendor and then receives only a 1 referral commission for subsequent transactions. In another example a primary vendor may receive a 1 referral commission for the first 1000 transactions made by the second vendor and then receive a 5 referral commission for all subsequent transactions. In another example a referral commission may be a flat fee provided to the first vendor. The fee may be based on the second vendor completing a minimum number of offer transactions through the platform . Alternatively the flat fee may be paid whether or not any revenue is generated by the second vendor. In any event the total sum paid as a referral commission the total time that a referral commission may be accumulated or any variation or combination of total sum and total time may be limited to a pre set maximum. Many different types of referral commission structures may be associated with the alternate payment platform such as applying a commission value to an outstanding balance or establish a credit balance to pay the referrer vendor fees associated with the platform .

Referral commissions may be tracked so that they may be displayed and analyzed through a vendor interface of the alternate payment platform . The alternate payment platform may record each referral agreement each transaction of a referrer and or a referee and the like necessary to support referral commission tracking. The vendor interface may allow vendors to monitor and manage referral commissions. In an example and without limitation referees may be able to track referral commissions paid to their referrer and referrers may track display and manage referral commissions on behalf of their referees. Referral commission reports may be generated by the vendor interface. The vendor interface may also allow vendors to indicate a referral update the status of a referral request that a referral commission be paid and the like.

Subsidizing offers may facilitate optimizing aspects of the alternate payment platform such as sales. Subsidizing offers facilitates providing offers that result in a loss under limited conditions. Offer subsidizing may involve using revenue from one offer to subsidize a negative cash flow offer. Subsidizing may facilitate increasing alternate offer acceptances to more quickly reach a secondary offeror higher paying price tier . In an example and without limitation Zagat may indicate that they would accept payment of 20 for every primary offer and that they prefer eBay to be presented as an alternate offer . However eBay may only be willing to pay 16 to the platform when a user accepts an alternate offer . In order to cover the gap of a 20 Zagat payout and a 16 eBay payment a 4 portion of revenue from a different alternate offer transaction may be allocated to fund the eBay alternate offer . However the 16 payment by eBay may increase when the number of accepted alternate offer exceeds a price tier threshold. If the eBay payment increases to 20 once the alternate offer quantity price tier is reached the eBay alternate offer may no longer be subsidized. The platform may automatically and dynamically configure subsidy relationships based at least on primary vendor pricing and secondary offeror pricing tiers . Additionally vendor rules and constraints that may limit the alternate offer available based on pricing requirements such as those herein described may be overcome by subsidizing offers in order to introduce alternate offer that may have a revenue maximizing outcome.

An alternate offer may be associated with multiple events such as sub offers. An accepted alternate offer that may be associated with a secondary offeror and a user known to the alternate payment platform may have independent pay events. Events associated with the user and the secondary offeror such as purchases transactions auction sales user referrals and the like may occur after the user accepts the alternate offer . These associated events may be tracked by the secondary offeror and or the platform so that the platform may debit the secondary offeror appropriately. In an example and without limitation a user may select an eBay alternate offer . The user may activate an eBay account make a bid make a winning bid execute a Buy It Now transaction and the like which may be tracked by the secondary offeror and or the platform so that the platform can recognize revenue from the secondary offeror . In another example an alternate offer transaction may be linked with a user account in the alternate payment platform so that a record of the secondary transaction e.g. user secondary offeror offer and the like may be maintained for later reference. When there is new activity associated with a previous transaction such as a transaction between the user and the secondary offeror e.g. a subscription renewal a repeat purchase of the same offer a sub offer and the like additional revenue may be generated and associated with the user account.

Revenue generated from multiple events and or sub offers may be allocated to the alternate payment platform a platform facilitator a primary vendor a combination of platform participants and the like. Revenue may be generated on a per event basis or on a volume of events basis. In the scenario described above for eBay each individual event may be valued and accumulated on a per event basis a Buy It Now transaction may generate 0.03 while a winning bid may be valued at 0.05. Events may be tracked and payment may be made when a minimum event volume threshold is reached. Alternatively each event or sub offer may count toward an event threshold so that reaching the threshold perhaps within a specified time frame results in the secondary offeror paying the platform . The amount paid may be a variable amount based on for example how quickly the threshold was achieved. Revenue thusly generated may be tracked and managed through a vendor interface to the platform .

A participant of the alternate payment platform such as a user a primary vendor a secondary offeror a facilitator and the like may ascertain the status of fulfillment of alternate offer requirements for obtaining a primary offer . The platform may track user activity associated with fulfillment of an alternate offer that the user selected. The platform may present the user alternate offer related activity on a user interface to the platform a webpage in an SMS a pager an IVR an email and the like. In an example and without limitation if the alternate offer requires that two winning bids be placed on eBay the platform may track account activation bid placement outbid activity losing bids and the number of winning bids. Once the user has accumulated two winning bids the platform may provide confirmation that the alternate offer requirements have been met and may provide access to the primary offer such as through activation codes passwords serial numbers and the like associated with the primary transaction facility as herein described.

A participant or user of the alternate payment platform may manage fulfillment of alternate offer requirements through the platform . The user may view such as through a user interface of the platform the alternate offer requirements in such a way that the user may access the resources websites and the like for fulfilling the requirements through the platform . In an example a user may be required to perform a purchase by winning a bid or using Buy it Now and make the payment for the purchase through PayPal. The platform may provide access to eBay and PayPal so that the user can complete the requirements without accessing eBay or PayPal outside of the platform . In this way a user known to the platform may perform any or all actions and meet any or all requirements of a primary and alternate offer through the platform .

Transaction auditing may be associated with the alternate payment platform . The platform may include accounting associated with aspects of the platform such as transactions. In addition to providing financial accounting services platform accounting may provide the transaction auditing for the platform . Platform accounting may use transaction auditing to verify financial activity associated with transactions such as comparing actual amounts received e.g. checks cash electronic transfers deposits and the like to transaction amounts. Transaction auditing may access transaction information including individual transaction data aggregated transaction data multi pay events sub offers downstream activities stemming from an alternate offer pricing volume threshold crossings charge backs cancelled transactions vendor fees currency conversion and the like. The value associated with the transaction information may be used by transaction auditing to calculate and compare advertiser fees referral commissions and the like with actual amounts such as payments from vendors. If the comparison determines that a vendor has overpaid a credit may be issued to the vendor and a status alert may be generated notifying platform accounting of the overpayment. If the comparison determines that the vendor has paid the correct amount a status alert may be generated notifying platform accounting that the vendor has no payment currently due. If the comparison determines that the vendor has paid too little a status alert may be generated notifying platform accounting of the underpayment. Additionally an alert may be automatically delivered to the vendor for notification of such underpayment. Delivery of the alert may be by email SMS IVR postal mail and the like.

The alternate payment platform may have access controls. The access control may include individualized log ins. An individualized login such as a user credential associated with the platform may include certain capabilities associated with access and change control that may determine what aspects of the user can access and what aspects of the platform the user can change. In an example and without limitation a vendor may have a primary contact and a number of secondary contacts associated with the platform . Contact credentials for access and change control may differ for primary contacts and secondary contacts allowing certain tasks and capabilities to be available to primary contacts but not to secondary contacts and vice versa. In an example and without limitation a primary contact may be able to change a secondary contact s access level whereas a secondary contact may not be able to change their level of access.

The access control may include audit logging. Audit logging may include recording changes such as inserts updates deletions logon errors and the like. Recording may include writing to a database such as an audit database so that entries may be managed reported aggregated reviewed and the like. Writing to the audit log may be performed automatically. Audit logging may be enabled or disabled for individual users vendors transactions offers actions action types access criteria and the like. The audit log may be searched sorted viewed and the like. Details of the audit log may be viewed chronologically by event type and the like.

The access control may include access restrictions. Access to the alternate payment platform may be based on the identity of a user identity of a group the action the user may be performing rules permissions and the like. In an example and without limitation a rule may permit only the primary contact from a vendor to access a profile change webpage. In another example a matrix of groups and rules permissions such as access control rules for the various tiers pages of the alternate payment platform may be described.

The alternate payment platform may include vendor cross pollinating. The platform may identify one or more offers to present to the user based at least in part on aspects of the user interaction with the platform . Aspects of user interaction may include primary offers alternate offer demographic data user preferences user queries and the like.
