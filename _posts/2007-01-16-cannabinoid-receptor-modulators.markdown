The present invention relates to cannabinoid receptor modulators particularly antagonists or inverse agonists of the CBreceptor useful for the treatment of obesity metabolic disorders addiction diseases of the central nervous system cardiovascular disorders respiratory disorders and gastrointestinal disorders pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and methods of treatment using the compounds and compositions to treat conditions such as obesity metabolic disorders addiction diseases of the central nervous system cardiovascular disorders respiratory disorders and gastrointestinal disorders.

The CBreceptor is one of the most abundant neuromodulatory receptors in the brain and is expressed at high levels in the hippocampus cortex cerebellum and basal ganglia e.g. Wilson et al. 2002 vol. 296 678 682 . Selective CBreceptor antagonists for example pyrazole derivatives such as rimonabant e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 432 984 can be used to treat various conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome e.g. Bensaid et al. 2003 vol. 63 no. 4 pp. 908 914 Trillou et al. 2002 vol. 284 R345 R353 Kirkham 2002 vol. 284 R343 R344 neuroinflammatory disorders e.g. Adam et al. 2002 vol. 12 no. 10 1475 1489 U.S. Pat. No. 6 642 258 cognitive disorders and psychosis e.g. Adam et al. 2002 vol. 12 pp. 1475 1489 addiction e.g. smoking cessation U.S. Patent Publ. 2003 0087933 gastrointestinal disorders e.g. Lange et al. 2004 vol. 47 627 643 and cardiovascular conditions e.g. Porter et al. 2001 vol. 90 45 60 Sanofi Aventis Publication Bear Steams Conference New York Sep. 14 2004 pages 19 24 .

Preparation of 4 5 Di hetero aryl octahydro benzo 1 2 5 thiadiazole 2 2 dioxides and 4 5 Di hetero aryl octahydro benzoimidazol 2 ones

4 5 Di hetero aryl octahydro benzo 1 2 5 thiadiazole 2 2 dioxides and 4 5 di hetero aryl octahydro benzoimidazol 2 ones represented by bg and bh can be prepared as shown in General Scheme M above. Triflate bc generated from ketone bb by treatment with LDA i.e. lithium diisopropylamide followed by triflic anhydride can undergo Stille coupling with vinyl tributyltinhydride to give the diene bd. Diels Alder reaction of diene bd with maleic anhydride can give the anhydride be. Compound be can undergo Curtius rearrangement e.g. using the procedure of R. Seito et. al 59 1689 1986 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety to form the diamine bf. The diamine bf can be readily converted to compounds bg and bh by treatment with sulfurylchloride and carbonyldiimidazole respectively.

solactone bl and isolactam bp can be prepared according to General Scheme N above. Cinnamyl alcohol bi can undergo coupling with a substituted propargylic acid to give the ester bj which under selective hydrogenation conditions can yield bk. Standard Diels Alder cyclization of bk and subsequent reduction of the internal double bond can provide compound bl. Similarly bi can be converted to the amine bm. Amine bm can be converted to Diels Alder precursor bo by reaction with a propargylic acid and subsequent selective reduction. Thermal Diels Alder reaction of bo can give the lactam bp after reduction of the double bond.

The synthesis of an embodiment of the formula I involves the application of Diels Alder reaction. The Diels Alder precursor IIIcan be readily prepared by coupling the dienoic acid Iand the allyl amine II. The amide can be either protected with an appropriate functional group Ris a protecting group or it can be used without any protection Ris hydrogen . When IIIis subjected to the Diels Alder reaction it gives the cyclization product IV. The yield and selectivity of the products in this step can depend on a variety of reaction conditions such as the solvent used the temperature employed for the cyclization the additives used in the reaction medium such as Lewis acids etc. Following the Diels Alder reaction an Rgroup can be introduced and the double bond reduced to provide Vwhich can be subjected to the deprotection conditions to cleave the protecting group to give VI. The substitution of Aror Arcan be further functionalized or transformed. Non limiting examples of protecting groups for Rinclude all those known to protect a nitrogen and examples may be found in Green et al. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by T. W. Greene and P. G. Wuts 1999 Third edition John Wiley Sons Inc. Preferred amide protecting groups include but are not limited to tert butoxycarbonyl Boc benzyl oxycarbonyl Cbz para methoxy benzyl 3 4 dimethoxybenzyl allyl trimethylsilyl ethyl TMSE methoxy methyl MOM benzyloxymethyl BOM methoxy tert butyldimethylsilyl TBDMS Triisopropylsilyl TIPS methoxy carbonyl and ethoxycarbonyl etc. Preferred electrophilic reagents include for example optionally substituted alkyl halides e.g. methyl iodide ethyl iodide propyl iodide Br CHCH OTBS optionally substituted benzyl halides e.g. benzyl bromide para cyano benzyl bromide ortho cyano benzyl bromide and meta cyano benzyl bromide . Electrophilic reagents are electron deficient reagents that can react with another molecule by accepting a pair of electrons to form a new bond. The electrophiles which are also a Lewis acids can be positively charged have an atom which carries a partial positive charge or have an atom which does not have an octet of electrons see Page 541 of Mechanism and Theory in Organic Chemistry by T.

Competition binding assays for cannabinoid CBand CBaffinity were performed by incubating commercially purchased membranes prepared from cells expressing each receptor subtype 8 g pro with 0.5 nM H CP55 940 a non selective cannabinoid agonist along with concentrations of drug ranging from 0.0001 3 M in Buffer A 5 mM MgCl 2.5 mM EDTA and 013 BSA . Non specific binding was defined in the presence of 10 M CP55 940. For saturation studies concentrations of H CP55 940 ranging from 0.1 5 nM were incubated with membranes in the presence and absence of 10 M CP55 940. Assays were terminated after incubation for 1 hours by rapid filtration onto 0.3 polyethylenamine treated GF C filterplates using a BRANDEL cell harvester. The plates were dried and MICROSCINT scintillation cocktail was added after which the bound radioactivity was quantified using a TOPCOUNT scintillation counter.

The dissociation constant K of H CP55 940 at the CBand CBreceptor were determined by plotting specific binding at each concentration of radioligand and analysis by non linear regression. For competition studies the concentration of each drug that inhibited 50 percent of H CP55 940 binding IC was determined by non linear regression analysis of the radioligand displacement curves. Affinity constants K were calculated using the equation derived by Cheng and Prusoff 1973 defined as IC 1 conc. ligand K .

The functional efficacy of compounds to activate second messengers within the cell was determined utilizing the GTP S binding assay. Guanine nucleotides are phosphorylated within the plasma membrane of the cell following binding and activation by agonists. A radiolabelled derivative of guanine triphosphate GTP is utilized in this assay as it cannot be dephosphorylated and therefore accumulates following agonist binding. The simultaneous presence of an antagonist into this system will shift the agonist concentration curve to the right with increasing concentrations of antagonist producing a greater rightward shift in the dose response curve of the agonist.

Commercially purchased membranes were incubated with 10 mM GDP to allow sufficient substrate for phosphorylation in the presence of agonist. The membranes were then pre incubated with increasing concentrations of test compound for 30 minutes to determine if they were capable of stimulating phosphorylation alone. Increasing concentrations of the non selective cannabinoid agonist WIN55 122 were then added in the presence or absence of each concentration of test compound. The assay was then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. To complete the assay S GTP S was added and the assay incubated for another 30 minutes. Assays were terminated by rapid filtration onto 10 mM sodium phosphate treated GF C filterplates using a BRANDEL cell harvester. The plates were dried and Microscint scintillation cocktail was added after which the bound radioactivity was quantified using a TOPCOUNT scintillation counter.

The stimulation of S GTP S binding as a function of the concentration of the agonist WIN55 122 in the absence and presence of test compound was plotted and the ECdetermined by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. A Schild analysis of the rightward shift in the dose response curve of WIN55 122 in the presence of test compound was determined by plotting the concentration of test compound against the negative log of the dose ratio 1 ECagonist test compound EC50 of agonist alone . A linear regression analysis yields the Kb defined as the X intercept of the linear equation.
