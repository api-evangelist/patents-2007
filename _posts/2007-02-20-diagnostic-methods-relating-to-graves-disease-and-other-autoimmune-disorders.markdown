This invention was made with government support under grant numbers EY8976 EY11708 EY016339 RR017304 DK063121 and RR00425 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

This invention relates generally to molecular medicine and autoimmune diseases and more specifically to methods for diagnosis of Graves disease GD .

The immune system is a complicated network of cells and molecules that normally work to defend the body and eliminate infections caused by bacteria viruses and other invading microbes. If a person has an autoimmune disease the immune system mistakenly attacks self targeting the cells tissues and organs of a person s own body. A collection of immune system cells and molecules at a target site is broadly referred to as inflammation.

Cells responsible for the specificity of the immune system are referred to as lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are a class of white blood cells. The antigen specific immune system comprises a variety of differentiated T cells thymus derived lymphocytes and B cells bone marrow derived lymphocytes . Different categories and sub categories of lymphocytes are defined by expression of different cell surface antigens. Specifically various categories and sub categories of T cells have been identified by characteristic patterns of cell surface antigen expression.

There are many different types of autoimmune diseases that each affect the body in different ways. For example the autoimmune reaction is directed against the brain in multiple sclerosis and the gut in Crohn s disease. In other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus affected tissues and organs may vary among individuals with the same disease. Ultimately damage to certain tissues by the immune system may be permanent as with destruction of insulin producing cells of the pancreas in Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

While the incidence of most individual autoimmune diseases is rare as a group autoimmune diseases afflict millions of Americans. Most autoimmune diseases strike women more often than men in particular they affect women of working age and during their childbearing years.

In a number of autoimmune diseases including for example Graves disease GD Rheumatoid Arthritis RA myasthenia gravis insulin resistant diabetes Type I antibodies to cell membrane receptors lead to anti receptor hypersensitivity reactions that alter cellular function as a result of the binding of antibody to membrane receptors which can have a stimulatory or a blocking effect. For example in animal models of myasthenia gravis the production of antibodies by immunization to the acetylcholine receptor has resulted in the typical muscle fatigue and weakness noted in affected humans where this antibody has been shown to be present in serum and on muscle membranes and further prevents the binding of endogenously produced acetylcholine to its receptor thereby preventing muscle activation. Similarly in some diabetic individuals with extreme insulin resistance antibodies to insulin receptors have been shown that prevent the binding of insulin to its receptor.

Graves disease GD is a systemic autoimmune process characterized by several immune system abnormalities including the production of IgG directed against the thyrotropin receptor expansion of CD45RO T cells Bossowski et al. J. Ped Endocrinol Metab 16 63 70 2003 and lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid and connective tissue of the orbit Akamizu et al. 44 633 646 1997 . Thyroid associated ophthalmopathy TAO represents the orbital manifestation of GD. Extra ocular muscles and fat expand become inflamed and are remodeled extensively Akamizu et al. 44 633 646 1997 . Cytokines and lipid mediators synthesized by infiltrating T lymphocytes monocytes and mast cells drive tissue remodeling including the accumulation of hyaluronan an abundant non sulfated glycosaminoglycan Smith et al. 268 C382 C388 1995 Prabhakar et al. 24 802 835 2003 . The unique phenotype of orbital fibroblasts and their exaggerated responses to cytokines such as IL 1 represent the basis for disease susceptibility of these tissues Smith supra 1995 Wang et al. 271 22718 22728 1996 Young et al. 95 8904 8909 1998 Han et al. 277 16355 16364 2002 Cao and Smith Am J Physiol 277 1999 Cao et al. 273 29615 29625. 1998 . Why immunocompetent cells are recruited to the orbit in TAO remains uncertain.

For GD the mechanism through which immunocompetent cells are trafficked to affected tissues is critical to understanding and ultimately to developing therapies that address both the glandular as well as the non glandular manifestations of Graves Disease. IGF 1R is expressed by a disproportionately large fraction of fibroblasts from individuals with GD Pritchard et al. 170 6348 6354 2003 . When treated with IGF 1 or with IgG derived from these individuals GD IgG GD fibroblasts but not those from control donors synthesize high levels of IL 16 and RANTES two powerful T cell chemoattractants Pritchard et al. supra 2003 . In addition orbital fibroblasts from individuals with GD synthesize increased levels of hyaluronan when treated with GD IgG an action mediated by IGF 1R Smith and Hoa. 89 5076 5080 2004 . Auto antibodies directed against IGF 1R can be detected in almost all individuals with GD but in few individuals without the disease Pritchard et al. J Immunol 170 6348 6354 2003 Smith and Hoa. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 89 5076 5080 2004 Smith Autoimmunity 36 409 415 2003 .

The insulin like growth factor receptor IGF 1R pathway plays important and diverse roles in growth and development Benito et al. 66 221 230 1996 . This tyrosine kinase receptor has been implicated in several metabolic neoplastic and immunological diseases Walenkamp and Wit 66 221 23 2006 Kurmasheva and Houghton 1766 1 22 2006 Bateman and McNeill 63 1701 1705 2006 . . IGF 1R and associated IGF 1 binding proteins constitute a cell surface signaling complex De Meyts et al. 262 160 171 2004 Li and Miller 281 23785 23791 2006 . An IGF 1 binding domain resides in the extracellular domain of IGF 1R while three tyrosine residues represent auto phosphorylation sites namely Tyr1131 Tyr1135 and Tyr1136 within the activation loop of the IGF 1R catalytic domain Li and Miller supra 2006 . Phosphorylation at all three is required for optimal receptor activation. This culminates in the recruitment of multiple docking proteins and the generation of intracellular signaling De Meyts et al. 262 160 171 2004 .

IGF 1 and IGF 1R play important roles in hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation and normal immune function Zumkeller W. 43 487 491 2002 . Peripheral blood T and B cells and monocytes from control human donors express low levels of IGF 1R in vivo Kooijman et al. 131 2244 2250 1992 Kooijman et al. 25 931 935 1995 . Administration of IGF 1 increases the circulating pool of CD4 T cells and splenic B cells in mice Clark et al. 92 540 548 1993 Jardieu et al. 152 4320 4327 1994 suggesting a role for this growth factor in myelopoietic cell expansion Alpdogan et al. 75 1977 1983 2003 . It promotes T cell proliferation during early activation Hettmer et al. 66 95 103 2005 and inhibits apoptosis of both immature and mature T cells through at least three distinct mechanisms Liu et al. 54 919 925 2003 Navarro and Baserga 142 1073 1081 2001 . IGF 1 stimulates inflammatory cytokine production in T cells and monocytes including IL 2 Kooijman et al. 149 351 356 1996 TNF Renier et al. 137 4611 4618 1996 and IL 8 Kooijman et al. 15 1091 1098 2003 . It can bias lymphocyte development toward a Th2 phenotype by enhancing IL 10 Kooijman and Coppens 76 862 867 2004 IL 4 and IL 13 synthesis Wynes and Riches 171 3550 3559 2003 while inhibiting IFN function Bemabei et al. 102 2933 2939 2003 . With regard to B cell differentiation IGF 1 promotes immunoglobulin production in chimeric immunodeficient mice reconstituted with IGF 1R fetal liver cells Baudler et al. 174 5516 5525 2005 . It also enhances T cell independent humoral immune responses Baudler et al. supra 2005 . These findings indicate that functional IGF 1R may be required for T cell independent B cell responses and support its important role in B cell differentiation and antibody production.

Thus there exists a need for identification of immune system components that are implicated in the IGF 1R mediated autoimmune response. The present invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well.

The methods of the invention can be performed by determining the expression of cell surface markers by any method desired by the user including cytometric analysis Western blot RT PCR or a combination thereof. The methods of the invention can be practiced in combination with other diagnostic tools for GD including but not limited to measurement of serum hormone levels assessment of fT4 sensitive TSH or the Free T4 Index FTI thyroid scanning antibody test thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin or iodine response tests. This is especially useful in cases where the diagnosis is not at all obvious and reliance on a single diagnostic method is insufficient for example in patients severely ill with other disease elderly patients with apathetic hypothyroidism or when the presenting symptom is unusual such as muscle weakness or psychosis and diagnosis depends on clinical alertness and laboratory tests or when orbital changes are not accompanied by thyroid abnormalities or other laboratory alterations normally used to diagnose the disease. It also is useful in patients whom the other usual tests are negative and the thyroid hormone levels are normal. The patient might present with proptosis and other signs of orbital involvement. This is termed euthyroid Graves disease refers to such individuals who must be distinguished from those with bilateral orbital tumors.

In further embodiments the invention provides methods for choosing a therapy for an individual afflicted with a GD methods for prognosing staging and or monitoring GD or a predisposition thereto assigning a risk group methods of predicting an increased risk of relapse methods of predicting an increased risk of developing secondary complications methods of choosing a therapy for an individual methods of predicting response to a therapy for an individual methods of determining the efficacy of a therapy in an individual and methods of determining the prognosis for an individual. For each of these embodiments the method steps described above can be modified by selecting the appropriate control or series of controls to compare against in the final step. For methods directed to prognosis staging monitoring relapse prediction choosing a therapy or predicting a response to therapy or evaluating efficacy of therapy the sample is compared to a positive control or a series of positive controls to allow matching the sample to the closest control. In this series of controls each member of the series corresponds to a particular outcome along a spectrum of varying prognoses stages likelihoods of relapse therapy responses or efficacies.

Up regulation of the IGF 1 IGF 1R pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of human disease. With regard to malignancies neoplastic transformation can result in elevated IGF 1R levels the consequence of altered tumor suppressor gene function and constitutive Akt activity Tanno et al. 61 589 593 2001 . In hematopoietic cell lines p53 mutations are linked to increased IGF 1R gene expression and exaggerated proliferative responses to IGF 1 Gimita et al. 60 5278 5283 2000 . Expression of wild type p53 diminishes IGF 1R levels and the magnitude of these cellular responses Werner et al. 93 8318 8323 1996 . Constitutively active Akt and Src activated Akt up regulate IGF 1R levels in pancreatic cancer cells promoting cell survival Tanno et al. supra 2001 . Akt activity also mediates the anti apoptotic effects of IGF 1 in human T cells Walsh et al. 107 461 471 2002 .

With regard to autoimmune diseases IGF 1R cells pervade affected intestinal tissues in Crohn s disease focused primarily in the mucosa and sub mucosa El Yafi et al 139 526 533 2005 . Expression of IGF 1R by sub mucosal fibroblasts and adipocytes is confined to areas of fibrosis and inflammation. This is also true in chronic inflammatory lung diseases where increased numbers of IGF 1R and IGF 1 fibroblasts and infiltrating macrophages are found in pulmonary fibrosis and systemic sclerosis Lee et al. 69 157 164 1997 Aston et al. 151 1597 1603 1995 . IGF 1 generated by infiltrating cells promotes lung fibroblast proliferation Harrison et al. 86 141 148 1994 . A similar pattern has been described in GD where IGF 1 and IGF 1R are also expressed in thyroid tissue Maiorano et al. Int J Mol Med 2 483 486 1998 Maciel et al. Endocr Pathol 6 207 215 1995 . Analogous to orbital fibroblasts cultured thyrocytes express IGF 1R while IGF 1 and GD IgG induce IL 16 and RANTES in a time dependent manner Gianoukakis et al. 147 1941 1949 2006 . The actions of IGF 1 and GD IgG participate directly in recruitment of inflammatory cells to targeted tissues in GD.

As exemplified herein nearly uniform IGF 1R display was discovered by early myeloid cells in control bone marrow and from a patient with GD . This expression is retained by peripheral erythrocytes monocytes and NK cells Zumkeller W. 43 487 491 2002 . IGF 1R is also strongly expressed on T cells within the marrow but not by the majority of control mature T cells Kooijman et al. 131 2244 2250 1992 Kooijman et al. 25 931 935 1995 . A greater proportion of circulating mature lymphocytes retain the IGF 1R phenotype in GD showing that the gradient between receptor display prior to and following release from the marrow is diminished in the disease.

IGF 1 plays a critical role in early development and expansion of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow and thymus Alpdogan et al. 75 1977 1983 2003 . It induces granulopoiesis and the formation of granulocyte monocyte colonies in bone marrow cultures Schwartz et al. 14 337 350 1996 . IGF 1 also enhances the proliferation of promyelocytic erythroid and lymphocytic cell lines and bone marrow blast colony formation in vivo in patients with myeloid leukemia Sinclair et al. 72 66 72 1988 Zadik et al. 6 79 83 1993 . Expansion of CD4 T cells and splenic B cells occurs in mice following systemic administration of IGF 1 Jardieu et al. 152 4320 4327 1994 Alpdogan et al. supra 2003 . IGF 1R can be detected in thymic tissue and administration of IGF 1 in vivo promotes T cell and stromal re population of atrophic thymus in diabetic rats Binz et al. 87 3690 3694 1990 and following cyclosporine A treatment Beschomer et al. Transplantation 52 879 884 1991 . These effects are mediated through coordinate promotion of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. IGF 1R appears to mediate proliferative effects of IGF 1 in T and B lymphoblasts several T cell lines including Jurkat cells and T cells infected with HTLV 1 or 2 Lal et al. 17 31 35 1993 Lee et al. 62 28 35 1986 Cross et al. 160 205 210 1995 . Jurkat cells and those infected with HTLV 1 constitutively express IGF 1R and respond to IGF 1. These effects are inhibited by receptor blocking monoclonal antibodies. While IGF 1 does not typically enhance the proliferation of mature inactive T cells activation through TCR induces IGF 1R expression in vitro and facilitates IGF 1 dependent proliferation Kooijman et al. 38 95 104 1992 . As exemplified herein anti CD3 Ab PHA and anti TCR Ab expand IGF 1R cells Kozak et al. 109 318 331 1987 Johnson et al. 148 63 71 1992 Segretin et al. 59 276 280 2003 . As further exemplified herein T cells from patients with GD stably express IGF 1R and faithfully maintain their exaggerated proliferative response to IGF 1 in culture . In addition as shown below disease derived T cells treated with IGF 1 exhibit greater resistance to apoptosis. Thus increased IGF 1R display by T cells in GD underlies lymphocyte expansion through at least two distinct mechanisms.

IGF 1 inhibits the apoptosis of immature CD45RA and mature CD45RO T cells by attenuating PHA induced Fas expression and by inhibiting apoptosis resulting from growth factor withdrawal Tu et al. 165 1331 1336 2000 . This latter action is independent of Fas FasL Tu et al. supra 2000 . IGF 1 also promotes the transition of cord blood CD45RA T cells to a CD45RO phenotype by increasing the RA to RO conversion following antigen stimulation Tu et al. supra 2000 . This progression results from the survival of antigen specific CD4 T cells and antigen driven expansion of effector CD8 T cells. Over representation in peripheral blood of CD4 CD45RO and CD8 CD45RO T cells in GD has been demonstrated previously Bossowski et al. 16 63 70 2003 Aust et al. 104 50 58 1996 .

As disclosed herein most na ve CD4 and CD8 CD45RA T cells both from patients with GD and from control donors display IGF 1R while few IGF 1R CD45RO T cells were found in control donors Kooijman et al. 25 931 935 1995 . In contrast the vast majority of CD45RO T cells from patients with GD particularly those with the CD8 phenotype display IGF 1R. IGF 1 and GD IgG directly promote the survival or expansion of antigen specific T cells in GD through their interaction with IGF 1R. This discovery has to be viewed in the context of exaggerated IGF 1R expression by fibroblasts in this disease and the functional consequences of the interactions with anti IGF 1R activating GD IgG by those cells Pritchard et al. 170 6348 6354 2003 . Generation of chemoattractants IL 16 and RANTES constitute the basis for T cell infiltration in affected tissues Pritchard et al. 173 3564 3569 2004 . The disproportionate number of IGF 1R CD45RO T cells found in GD underlies memory T cell expansion in this disease and further implicates IGF 1R in its pathogenesis.

The invention also provides a method of reducing the severity of a condition associated with the expansion of memory T cells by blocking the activity of IGF 1R on the memory T cells thereby interrupting the expansion of memory T cells.

In one embodiment the invention provides a method of reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration by administering to a individual an effective amount of at least one substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin.

In a related embodiment the invention provides a method of reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration by administering to a individual an effective amount of at least one substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by reducing the release by a cell type for example fibroblasts of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule that attracts immunocompetent cells.

In a further embodiment the invention provides a method of reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration by administering to a individual an effective amount of at least one substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule that is normally released by fibroblasts and that attracts immunocompetent cells.

A substance that inhibits the fibroblast mediated influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues can be for example a substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin a substance that inhibits the interaction between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor or a substance that neutralizes at least one type of chemoattractant. Furthermore a substance that inhibits the influx of T lymphocytes to affected tissues can be for example a substance that inhibits the interaction between the IGF 1R autoantigen which can be located on a fibroblast or any other cell type for example a lymphocyte and an endogenous disease specific immunoglobulin G IgG a substance that inhibits the interaction between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor or a substance that neutralizes at least one type of chemoattractant molecule. A substance that inhibits the influx of T lymphocytes to affected tissues also can be for example any agent that interferes with the signaling cascade that lies downstream of the self antigen receptor and leads to chemoattractant recruitment or with the activity or expression of any molecule that is activated as a consequence of the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin.

Also provided by the invention disclosed herein are methods of diagnosing or predicting the susceptibility to an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration in an individual suspected of having a such a disease and methods of identifying a substance that can modulate fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor IGF 1R is an autoantigen recognized by endogenous disease specific immunoglobulins and upon activation can induce the recruitment of T lymphocytes by effecting the release of one or more chemoattractant molecules for example RANTES or IL 16. The IGF 1R that serves as the autoantigen can be located for example on fibroblasts as described herein but also can be located on other cell types including on the T lymphocytes themselves.

According to the invention a control can be a normal or negative control and or a GD or positive control against which a test level of CD3 IGF 1R T cells can be compared. The level of CD3 IGF 1R T cells is determined as the fraction of CD3 IGF 1R T cells among the T lymphocytes. Therefore it can be determined based on the control or baseline level of CD3 IGF 1R T cells whether a sample to be evaluated for CD3 IGF 1R T cells has a measurable difference or substantially no difference in the fraction of CD3 IGF 1R T cells as compared to the baseline level. In one aspect the baseline control is a indicative of the CD3 IGF 1R T cells of a normal e.g. healthy negative control non GD individual. Therefore the term negative control can be used in reference to a baseline level of CD3 IGF 1R T cells typically refers to a baseline level of expression from a population of individuals which is believed to be normal i.e. not having the GD . For other embodiments the test sample will be compared to a baseline that has been established from a individual or population of individuals with GD. Such a baseline level also referred to herein as a positive control refers to a level of CD3 IGF 1R T cells established from one or preferably a population of individuals who had been diagnosed with GD.

In one embodiment when the goal is to monitor the progression or regression of GD in an individual for example to monitor the efficacy of treatment of the disease or to determine whether a individual that appears to be predisposed to the disease or begins to develop the disease one baseline control can include the measurements of CD3 IGF 1R T cells in a sample from the individual that was taken from a prior test in the same individual. In this embodiment a new sample is evaluated periodically e.g. at annual or more regular physicals and any changes in CD3 IGF 1R T cells in the individual compared to the prior measurement and most typically also with reference to the above described normal and or positive controls are monitored. Monitoring of a individual s CD3 IGF 1R T cells profile can be used by the clinician to prescribe or modify treatment for the individual based on whether any differences in the fraction of CD3IGF 1R T cells is detected.

If desired the control or baseline levels of CD3IGF 1R T cells are obtained from peripheral blood cells can be collected from matched individuals . Matched individuals are chosen from control individuals on the basis of one or more characteristics such as gender age race or any relevant biological or sociological factor that may affect the baseline of the control individuals and the individual e.g. preexisting conditions consumption of particular substances levels of other biological or physiological factors . The number of matched individuals from whom control samples must be obtained to establish a suitable control level e.g. a population can be determined by those of skill in the art but should be statistically appropriate to establish a suitable baseline for comparison with the individual to be evaluated. The values obtained from the control samples are statistically processed using any suitable method of statistical analysis to establish a suitable baseline level using methods standard in the art for establishing such values. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that a baseline need not be established for each assay as the assay is performed but rather a baseline can be established by referring to a form of stored information regarding a previously determined control level of CD3IGF 1R T cells. Such a form of stored information can include for example but is not limited to a reference chart listing or electronic file of population or individual data regarding normal negative control or GD positive control a medical chart for the individual recording data from previous evaluations or any other source of data regarding control CD3IGF 1R T cells that is useful for the individual to be diagnosed or evaluated.

Throughout this specification and claims the word comprise or variations such as comprises or comprising will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.

The methods of the invention provide tools useful in choosing a therapy for an individual afflicted with a GD including methods for prognosing staging and or monitoring GD or a predisposition thereto assigning a risk group methods of predicting an increased risk of relapse methods of predicting an increased risk of developing secondary complications methods of choosing a therapy for an individual methods of predicting response to a therapy for an individual methods of determining the efficacy of a therapy in an individual and methods of determining the prognosis for an individual.

As used herein the term effective amount is a predetermined amount calculated to achieve the desired therapeutic effect for example to alter the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin or other biological activity resulting in reduction of the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. The required dosage will vary with the particular treatment and with the duration of desired treatment however it is anticipated that dosages between about 10 micrograms and about 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day will be used for therapeutic treatment. It may be particularly advantageous to administer such a substance in depot or long lasting form as discussed herein. A therapeutically effective amount is typically an amount of a substance that when administered in a physiologically acceptable composition is sufficient to achieve a plasma concentration of from about 0.1 g ml to about 100 g ml preferably from about 1.0 g ml to about 50 g ml more preferably at least about 2 g ml and usually 5 to 10 g ml. Therapeutic antibodies can be administered in proportionately appropriate amounts in accordance with known practices in this art.

As used herein reduction in severity is intended to refer to an arrest decrease or reversal in signs and symptoms physiological indicators secondary manifestations biochemical markers or metabolic indicators associated with a particular autoimmune disease. Symptoms of an autoimmune disease depend on the particular organ or tissue attacked by the host s immune system and can include for example tissue remodeling swelling of the joints neurological impairments neuroinflammation gastrointestinal inflammation skin inflammation decrease in insulin release in Type 1 diabetes reduced cortisol and aldosterone in autoimmune adrenal failure. Biochemical markers of an autoimmune disease can include for example disease specific immunoglobulins.

The invention method is useful for the treatment of a variety of autoimmune conditions that involve the activation of one or more cell types that express an autoantigen receptor for example fibroblasts resulting in the recruitment of immunocompetent cells. Immunocompetent cells are recruited to sites of inflammation through a mechanism that is initiated by activation of one or more cell types as a result of binding of endogenous antibodies to receptor autoantigens on cell surface of that cell type for example fibroblasts. As described herein Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor IGF 1R a tyrosine kinase represents an autoantigen that is expressed on fibroblast cells and initiates the fibroblast activation and subsequent cascade of events resulting in recruitment of immunocompetent cells. The IGF 1R nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are described for example by Ullrich et al. 5 10 2503 2512 1986 which is incorporated by reference. IGF 1R also is expressed on cell types other than fibroblasts such as for example on lymphocytes themselves where it can similarly serve as a mediator of T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration.

Insulin like growth factors IGF 1 and IGF 2 possess structural similarities with pro insulin. IGFs are synthesized largely by the liver in response to growth hormone and play important paracrine roles in a variety of tissues. IGF 1 exists largely bound to binding proteins and exerts its biological actions through an association with IGF 1 receptor IGF 1R a surface tyrosine kinase receptor Adams et al. 57 1050 1093 2000 . IGF 1R resembles the insulin receptor and mediates the growth promoting activities of both IGF 1 and IGF 2.

The human IGF 1R surface tyrosine receptor amino acid and corresponding nucleic acid sequence are publicly available for example in the NCBI Genbank database under Accession Nos. CAA28030 and X04434 respectively. The mature IGF 1R has a sequence of 1367 amino acids as described by Ullrich et al. 5 10 2503 2512 1986 which is incorporated herein by reference. This receptor involves a family of insulin receptor substrate proteins which in turn interact with the mitogen activated protein kinases. IGF 1R has been implicated in the pathogenesis of growth and neoplastic disorders.

This invention is based in part on the surprising discovery that IGF 1R plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of human autoimmunity. Many different cell types are known to express IGF 1R including those of the fibroblast lineage. Therefore the methods of the invention can be practiced with IGF 1R mediated orchestration of an autoimmune response regardless of whether the IGF 1R is present on fibroblasts or on another cell type for example monocytes or macrophages.

In one embodiment the invention method is useful for the treatment of an autoimmune disease in which activated cells for example fibroblasts that express the autoantigen recognized by the disease specific antibodies for example drive the recruitment of immunocompetent cells for example in Graves disease GD Rheumatoid Arthritis RA autoimmune thyroiditis Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 autoimmune adrenal failure pemphigus Lupus autoimmune nephritis autoimmune carditis pseudotumor of the orbit neuritis autoimmune pneumonitis.

As used herein the term autoimmune disease refers to a disorder that occurs because of autoimmunity a disease that is caused by an immune response to the body of the individual himself or herself. Autoimmunity is an etiology which means that it is a cause of disease and autoimmune diseases are classified based on their common etiology. The results of an autoimmune reaction vary and range from fever to destruction of diverse types tissues such as blood vessels cartilage myelin and skin. Autoimmunity can affect any organ in the body including for example the brain skin kidney lungs liver heart intestine and thyroid. Therefore autoimmune disease is anatomically diverse and the clinical expression of the disease depends upon the site affected. The resulting inflammation and tissue damage can cause kidney failure breathing problems abnormal heart function pain deformity delirium and death. Autoimmune diseases can affect connective tissues which are those tissues that bind together various tissues and organs.

A large number of conditions almost certainly have an autoimmune cause or component including for example Graves disease rheumatoid arthritis RA Insulin dependent Diabetes Type I Alopecia Areata Ankylosing Spondylitis Antiphospholipid Syndrome Autoimmune Addison s Disease Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Autoimmune Hepatitis Behcet s Disease Bullous Pemphigoid Cardiomyopathy Celiac Sprue Dermatitis Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome CFIDS Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy Churg Strauss Syndrome Cicatricial Pemphigoid CREST Syndrome Cold Agglutinin Disease Crohn s Disease Discoid Lupus Essential Mixed Cryoglobulinemia Fibromyalgia Fibromyositis Guillain Barr Hashimoto s Thyroiditis Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura ITP IgA Nephropathy Juvenile Arthritis Lichen Planus Lupus M ni re s Disease Mixed Connective Tissue Disease Multiple Sclerosis Myasthenia Gravis Pemphigus Vulgaris Pernicious Anemia Polyarteritis Nodosa Polychondritis Polyglandular Syndromes Polymyalgia Rheumatica Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis Primary Agammaglobulinemia Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Psoriasis Raynaud s Phenomenon Reiter s Syndrome Rheumatic Fever Sarcoidosis Scleroderma Sj gren s Syndrome Stiff Man Syndrome Takayasu Arteritis Temporal Arteritis Giant Cell Arteritis Ulcerative Colitis Uveitis Vasculitis Vitiligo Wegener s Granulomatosis.

Various autoimmune diseases are characterized by the presence of specific pathogenic antibodies that interact with fibroblast to mediate one or more manifestations of the particular disease as described for example for RA by Matsumoto et al. 286 1732 1999 and for Graves disease by Pritchard et al. 168 942 950 2002 both of which are incorporated herein by reference. For example in Graves disease disease specific endogenous immunoglobulins GD IgGs recognize and bind to the IGF 1R in order to activate fibroblasts that as a result express and release the T lymphocyte chemoattractant molecules RANTES and IL 16. Thus the invention provides a method of reducing the severity of an autoimmune condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration by administering to a individual an effective amount of at least one substance that inhibits the interaction between IGF 1R and an endogenous immunoglobulin for example IgG.

As described herein IGF 1R represents an autoantigen that is associated with the tissue manifestations of Graves disease at the sites of the orbit pre tibial skin and thyroid. In particular IGF 1R mediates both the glandular and extrathyroidal components of Graves disease by driving the infiltration of T lymphocytes to connective tissue. The thyroid stimulating hormone receptor TSHR which is involved in the thyroidal component of Graves disease provides a further example of an autoantigen involved in mediation of the manifestations of an autoimmune disease as described by Laugwitz et al. 93 116 1996 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The mediation of a condition associated with recruitment of T lymphocytes resulting from the binding and activation of an endogenous immunoglobulin to the autoantigen receptor IGF 1R can involve IGF 1R located on fibroblasts as well as on other cell types for example monocytes and macrophages. Therefore the invention also provides a method of reducing the severity of a condition associated with T lymphocyte infiltration by administering an effective amount of a substance that inhibits the interaction between IGF 1R and an endogenous disease specific immunoglobulin.

A substance that is useful in the invention methods for reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration or with IGF 1R mediated T lymphocyte recruitment where the IGF 1R autoantigen can be located on a non fibroblast cell can be for example a substance that inhibits the interaction between the IGF 1R autoantigen which can be located on a fibroblast or other cell type for example monocytes or macrophages and an endogenous disease specific immunoglobulin G IgG a substance that inhibits the interaction between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor or a substance that neutralizes at least one type of chemoattractant molecule. A substance useful in the invention methods for reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration or with IGF 1R mediated T lymphocyte recruitment where the IGF 1R autoantigen can be located on a non fibroblast cell can be for example an anti idiotype antibody directed against the antigen specific part of the sequence of a disease specific antibody for example an GD IgG or an RA IgG. Antigenic specificities are defined by the unique sequences idiotopes of the antigen combining site and anti idiotype antibodies recognize these specific sequences idiotopes of the disease specific antigen binding site and can for example resemble the epitope to which the disease specific IgG reacts. The substances described herein which modulate the influx of immunocompetent cells are collectively referred to herein as modulatory substances.

Graves Disease is characterized by hyperthyroidism caused by a generalized overactivity of the entire thyroid gland. The leading cause of hyperthyroidism Graves disease represents a basic defect in the immune system causing production of immunoglobulins which stimulate and attack the thyroid gland thereby leading to the growth of the gland and the overproduction of thyroid hormone. In addition to the glandular manifestations Graves disease also is associated with extrathyroidal manifestations Thyroid associated opthalmopathy TAO and dermopathy in which the auto antibodies attack the tissues in the eye muscles and in the pretibial skin respectively and cause extensive remodeling of the connective tissue. Connective tissue remodeling associated with TAO and dermopathy represents a secondary manifestation of a fibroblast mediated condition associated with T lymphocyte infiltration such as Graves disease that can be partly or wholly alleviated by administering an effective amount of at least one substance that inhibits the interaction between IGF 1R and an endogenous immunoglobulin.

As exemplified herein Rheumatoid Arthritis is a further autoimmune disease that can be reduced in severity by administering to a individual an effective amount of at least one substance that inhibits the interaction between IGF 1R and an endogenous immunoglobulin for example immunoglobulin G. Rheumatoid arthritis RA involves inflammation of the lining of body joints most commonly the small joints of the hands. Inflammation and thickening of the joint lining called the synovium can cause pain stiffness swelling warmth and redness. The affected joint may also lose its shape resulting in loss of normal movement and if uncontrolled may cause destruction of the bones deformity and eventually disability. In some individuals RA can also affect other parts of the body including the blood lungs skin and heart. As described herein RA specific antibodies RA IgGs activate RA fibroblasts by recognition of and binding to the IGF 1R which serves as an autoantigen expressed on the surface of the RA fibroblasts.

The methods of the invention also are useful for reducing the severity of a neuroinflammatory disorder for example an demyelinating disease. A central mechanism in the pathology of neuroinflammatory demyelinating diseases is the organ specific migration of activated T lymphocytes into the brain. Similar to models of neuroinflammatory disease such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE injury to the spinal cord precipitates the activation of resident microglia and the recruitment of circulating inflammatory cells including macrophages and lymphocytes. In the EAE rat model these cells can cause tissue damage and loss of neurological function via autoimmune reactions to myelin proteins. Consistent with the concept of trauma induced autoimmune reactions T lymphocytes isolated from spinal injured rats can cause neurologic deficits and histopathologic changes similar to EAE when injected intravenously into naive animals as described by Popovich et al. 45 4 349 363 1996 which is incorporated herein by reference. Based on the existence of trauma induced autoimmunity by which the autoreactive repertoire regulates ongoing central nervous system CNS immunologic responses the methods of the invention are applicable in the context of CNS trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as for example Multiple Sclerosis MS Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy Amyotrophic Laterial Sclerosis ALS and Alzheimer s Disease.

Demyelinating diseases are an important group of neurological disorders because of the frequency with which they occur and the disability that they cause. Demyelinating diseases have in common a focal or patchy destruction of myelin sheaths that is accompanied by a neuroinflammatory response. Neuroinflammatory demyelinating diseases can be divided into processes affecting myelin of the central nervous system and those affecting myelin of the peripheral nervous system. Multiple Sclerosis MS is a central nervous system demyelinating disease with an autoimmune etiology as reviewed in Martin et al. 10 153 187 1992 which is incorporated herein by reference. Other demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system include for example acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ADE including postinfectious and postvaccinal encephalomyelitis acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis and progressive necrotizing myelopathy. Demyelinating diseases of the peripheral nervous system include for example acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy Guillain Barr syndrome chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy CIDP demyelinating neuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy and neuropathy associated with sclerosing myeloma.

A modulating substance can inhibit for example the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin or the interaction between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor. A modulating substance that inhibits for example the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can act either directly to disrupt or prevent the interaction or can act indirectly as for example a blocking agent that renders functionally inactive either the receptor autoantigen or the immunoglobulin. Such an inhibitory modulating substance which is useful for practicing the invention can effect a decrease in the extent amount or rate of autoantigen receptor or immunoglobulin expression or activity a decrease in the extent amount or rate of expression or activity of a chemoattractant molecule or its receptor or a decrease in the extent amount or rate of release of a chemoattractant molecule. An effective amount is the amount of a modulating substance necessary to effect a reduction in the extent amount or rate of fibroblast activation. For example an effective amount of a substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin or the interaction between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor or the release of a chemoattractant molecule can cause a two fold five fold ten fold 20 fold 100 fold or more reduction in the amount or rate of fibroblast activation. A modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between for example a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can be an agent that effects a decrease in the extent amount or rate of the receptor autoantigen expression or effecting a decrease in the activity of receptor autoantigen for example IGF 1R. Inhibitory modulating substances useful for practicing the claimed invention include for example binding molecules such as antibodies fragments of antibodies or antibody like molecules that bind the autoantigen receptor for example IGF 1R but do not lead to activation of the fibroblast.

An example of a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin is any molecule that binds either the receptor autoantigen or the endogenous immunoglobulin with sufficient affinity to decrease fibroblast activation. Additionally an inhibitory modulating substance can be any molecule binds to a regulatory molecule or gene region so as to inhibit or promote the function of the regulatory protein or gene region and effect a decrease in the extent or amount or rate of receptor expression or activity. An example of a substance that inhibits the interaction between the IGF 1R autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can include an antisense nucleic acid molecule a dominant negative IGF 1R mutant or a transcriptional inhibitor that binds to an IGF 1R 5 promoter regulatory region.

Such a modulating substance can be produced using methods which are generally known in the art and include the use of a purified autoantigen receptor polypeptide for example IGF 1R to produce antibodies or to screen libraries of compounds as described previously for those which specifically bind a corresponding autoantigen polypeptide but do not trigger T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration. For example in one aspect an antibody that is selective for an autoantigen receptor polypeptide of the invention can be used directly as an antagonist or indirectly as a targeting or delivery mechanism for bringing a cytotoxic or cytostatic agent to disease specific fibroblast cells that express the corresponding autoantigen receptor. Such agents can be for example radioisotopes. The antibodies can be generated using methods that are well known in the art and include for example polyclonal monoclonal chimeric humanized single chain Fab fragments and fragments produced by a Fab expression library.

Biologically effective antisense molecules as well as dominant negative mutant versions of a receptor autoantigen for example the IFG 1R are suitable substances for practicing the invention methods. Antisense nucleotide sequences as well as sequences encoding for a dominant negative IGF1 R can be placed in an appropriate plasmid vector and employed to inhibit the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin or as a substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues.

In one aspect an antisense molecule to a nucleic acid molecule that encodes for example a receptor autoantigen a chemoattractant molecule a chemoattractant molecule receptor can be used to block the transcription or translation of the corresponding mRNA. Specifically cells can be transformed with sequences complementary to a nucleic acid molecule encoding for example IGF 1R. Such methods are well known in the art and sense or antisense oligonucleotides or larger fragments can be designed from various locations along the coding or control regions of sequences encoding autoantigen receptor polypeptides or nucleic acids. These antisense molecules may be DNA stable derivatives of DNA such as phosphorothioates or methylphosphonates RNA stable derivatives of RNA such as 2 O alkyl RNA or other oligonucleotide mimetics. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 652 355 and 5 652 356 which describe the synthesis and effect of physiologically stable antisense molecules are incorporated herein by reference. Thus antisense molecules may be used to indirectly inhibit the interaction between for example a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin or a chemoattractant molecule and its corresponding receptor or to prevent the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by reducing the release by fibroblasts of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule that attracts immunocompetent cells.

A dominant negative mutant of the IGF 1R for example the dominant negative mutant of IGF 1R designated IGF 1R 486 STOP described herein also can serve as a substance that can inhibit the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin or as a substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by reducing the release by fibroblasts of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule that attracts immunocompetent cells.

Host cells transformed with a nucleotide sequence that encodes a dominant negative mutant of the present invention may be cultured under conditions suitable for the expression and recovery of the encoded protein from cell culture. Embodiments of the present invention are host cells transformed with a purified polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid sequence that corresponds to a dominant negative IGF 1R polypeptide. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that cells of this type or preparations made from these cells also can be used in the methods of the invention for identifying a modulating substance described herein.

Expression vectors derived from retroviruses adenovirus adeno associated virus AAV herpes or vaccinia viruses or from various bacterial plasmids can be used for delivery of antisense nucleotide sequences to the fibroblast or other cell population. The viral vector selected should be able to infect the targeted cells for example fibroblast cells and be safe to the host and cause minimal cell transformation. Retroviral vectors and adenoviruses provide an efficient useful and well characterized means of introducing and expressing foreign genes into mammalian cells. These vectors are well known in the art and have very broad host and cell type ranges express genes stably and efficiently. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct such recombinant vectors and are described in Sambrook et al. Sambrook et al. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press Plainview N.Y. 1989 which is incorporated herein by reference. Even in the absence of integration into the DNA such vectors can continue to transcribe RNA molecules until they are disabled by endogenous nucleases. Transient expression can last for a month or more with a non replicating vector and even longer if appropriate replication elements are part of the vector system.

Eukaryotic recombinant host cells are especially preferred. Examples include but are not limited to yeast mammalian cells including but not limited to cell lines of human bovine porcine monkey and rodent origin and insect cells including but not limited to Drosophila and silkworm derived cell lines. Cell lines derived from mammalian species are particularly suitable and can be obtained from a variety of commercial sources known in the art.

The expression vector may be introduced into host cells via any one of a number of techniques including for example transformation transfection lipofection protoplast fusion and electroporation. Commercially available kits including well characterized vectors transfection reagents and conditions and cell culture materials are well established and readily available for example from Clonetech Palo Alto Calif. Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. Pharmingen San Diego Calif. and Stratagene La Jolla Calif. . The expression vector containing cells are clonally propagated and individually analyzed to determine the level of polypeptide production. Identification of host cell clones which express for example a dominant negative mutant can be performed by several means including but not limited to immunological reactivity with antibodies and or the presence of host cell associated specific biological activity. A variety of protocols for detecting and measuring the expression of the dominant negative mutant using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the protein are known in the art. Examples include for example enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA radioimmunoassay RIA and fluorescent activated cell sorting FACS .

Ribozymes which are enzymatic RNA molecules can be used to catalyze the specific cleavage of an autoantigen receptor mRNA for example IGF 1R mRNA. The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target autoantigen receptor RNA followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are identified by scanning an autoantigen receptor RNA for ribozyme cleavage sites which include the following sequences GUA GUU and GUC. Once identified short RNA sequences of between 15 and 20 ribonucleotides corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site can be evaluated for secondary structural features which can render the oligonucleotide inoperable. The suitability of candidate targets can also be evaluated by testing accessibility to hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides using ribonuclease protection assays. Antisense molecules and ribozymes of the invention can be prepared by any method known in the art for the synthesis of nucleic acid molecules.

As described herein a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between for example a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin or between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor can be a compound or molecule that binds either the receptor or its ligand for example IGF 1R with sufficient affinity to reduce or inhibit the specific interaction that leads to receptor activation and subsequent T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration. The autoantigen can be located on a fibroblast or any other cell type. A modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between for example a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin or between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor can be a macromolecule such as polypeptide nucleic acid carbohydrate or lipid. Thus a substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can be an antibody antisense nucleic acid a dominant negative mutant of a receptor autoantigen or any compound identified by the methods described below. A modulating substance that inhibits for example the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin or between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor can also be a derivative analogue or mimetic compound as well as a small organic compound as long as the interaction between the receptor and ligand that leads to T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration is reduced or inhibited in the presence of the substance. The size of a modulating substance such as one that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin is not important so long as the molecule exhibits or can be made to exhibit inhibitory activity with regard to the interaction that leads to fibroblast activation. For example a substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can be as little as between about one and six and as large as tens or hundreds of monomer building blocks which constitute a macromolecule or chemical binding molecule. Similarly an organic compound can be a simple or complex structure so long as it has sufficient activity with regard to inhibiting the interaction for example between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin or between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor that leads to T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration.

Examples of a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin include for example IGF 1R antisense nucleic acid and transcriptional inhibitors that bind to the IGF1R promoter regulatory region. Additionally receptors ligands growth factors cytokines or chemokines for example which inhibit fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration are useful for practicing the methods of the invention. Furthermore as described above DNA binding polypeptides such as transcription factors and DNA replication factors are also modulatory substances useful for practicing the invention methods so long as they have selective activity with regard to inhibiting the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin that leads to fibroblast activation inhibiting the interaction between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor neutralizing a chemoattractant molecule inhibiting the release by a fibroblast of a chemoattractant molecule or any of the mechanisms described herein or known to those of skill in the art for inhibiting T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration. Finally polypeptides nucleic acids and chemical compounds such as those selected from random and combinational libraries can also be modulating substances that inhibit the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin that leads to receptor activation resulting in T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration.

As described herein a modulating substance useful for practicing the invention methods can have selective activity with regard to directly or indirectly inhibiting the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin that leads to fibroblast activation inhibiting the interaction between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor neutralizing a chemoattractant molecule inhibiting the release by a fibroblast of a chemoattractant molecule or any of the mechanisms described herein or known to those of skill in the art for inhibiting T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration.

Various approaches can be used for identifying a modulating substance that reduces the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration upon being administered in an effective amount. For example one approach is to use the information available regarding the structure and function of IGF 1R to generate binding molecule populations from molecules known to function as protease binding molecules or known to exhibit or be capable of exhibiting binding affinity specific for a particular autoantigen receptor polypeptide. As set forth herein a modulating substance that upon being administered in an effective amount reduces the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can be an antibody and other receptor of the immune repertoire that prevents fibroblast activation resulting in T lymphocyte infiltration compound. An antibody that recognizes a catalytic site of a molecule associated with mediation of fibroblast activation is especially useful for practicing the invention method of reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration by administering to a individual an effective amount of at least one substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin. The normal function of such immune receptors is to bind essentially an infinite number of different antigens and ligands. Therefore generating a diverse population of binding molecules from an immune repertoire for example can be useful for identifying a modulating substance that if administered in an effective amount reduces the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

A modulating substance that inhibits for example the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin and prevents fibroblast activation can further be identified from a large population of unknown molecules by methods well known in the art. Such a population can be a random library of peptides or small molecule compounds. The population can be generated to contain a sufficient diversity of sequence or structure so as to contain a molecule that will bind to an endogenous autoantigen receptor molecule such as for example IGF 1R or its corresponding nucleic acid. Those skilled in the art will know what size and diversity is necessary or sufficient for the intended purpose. A population of sufficient size and complexity can be generated so as to have a high probability of containing a modulating substance that binds for example an endogenous autoantigen receptor molecule such as IGF 1R with sufficient affinity to modulate activity. Numerous other types of library molecule populations exist and are described further below.

While the descriptions set forth herein mostly utilize as an example a receptor autoantigen and corresponding immunoglobulin it is understood that the types of modulatory substances and identification methods described herein are applicable to any modulating substance described herein for practicing the invention methods including a modulatory substance that has selective activity with regard to inhibiting the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin inhibiting the interaction between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor neutralizing a chemoattractant molecule inhibiting the release by a fibroblast of a chemoattractant molecule or any additional mechanism described herein or known to those of skill in the art for directly or indirectly inhibiting T lymphocyte recruitment and infiltration.

Any molecule that binds to an endogenous autoantigen receptor to a gene region that controls expression of such an autoantigen or to a regulatory molecule that modulates activity or expression of an endogenous autoantigen receptor as well as to any regulatory molecule that modulates expression an endogenous autoantigen receptor for example IGF 1R and reduces or inhibits fibroblast activation is a modulating substance useful for practicing the invention. For example a substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can be a regulatory molecule that affects the expression of an autoantigen such as IGF1R by modulating the action of a transcription factor that controls or upregulates transcription of the autoantigen receptor nucleic acid.

An example of a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin useful for practicing the claimed invention can be an antibody against a regulator molecule that modulates expression or activity of a receptor autoantigen or an endogenous disease specific immunoglobulin. Alternatively it may be desired to use populations of random peptide populations to identify a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin. Given the guidance provided herein those skilled in the art will know or can determine what type of approach and what type of modulating substance is appropriate for practicing the methods of the invention.

A moderate sized population for identification of a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can consist of hundreds and thousands of different binding molecules within the population whereas a large sized binding molecule population will consist of tens of thousands and millions of different binding molecule species. More specifically large and diverse populations of binding molecules for the identification of a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin will contain any of about 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 or more different molecule species. One skilled in the art will know the approximate diversity of the population of test substances sufficient to identify a modulating substance of the invention a term collectively referred to herein to describe a substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin a substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin a substance that inhibits the interaction between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor or a substance that neutralizes at least one type of chemoattractant.

Recombinant libraries of test substances can be used to identify a modulating substance of the invention since large and diverse populations can be rapidly generated and screened. Recombinant libraries of expressed polypeptides useful for identifying a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can be engineered in a large number of different ways known in the art. Recombinant library methods similarly allow for the production of a large number of test substance populations from naturally occurring repertoires. Whether recombinant or otherwise essentially any source of test substance population can be used so long as the source provides a sufficient size and diversity of different compounds to identify a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin.

A phage expression library in which lysogenic phage cause the release of bacterially expressed binding molecule polypeptides is a specific example of a recombinant library that can be used to identify a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin. In another type of phage expression library large numbers of potential modulating substances that inhibit the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can be expressed as fusion polypeptides on the periplasmic surface of bacterial cells. Libraries in yeast and higher eukaryotic cells exist as well and are similarly applicable in the methods of the invention. Those skilled in the art will know or can determine what type of library is useful for identifying a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin.

In addition to the methods described above which utilize purified polypeptide to screen libraries of compounds for those that inhibit the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin an inhibitory modulating substance can be identified by using purified polypeptide to produce antibodies. For example antibodies which are specific for IGF 1R or another endogenous autoantigen receptor can be used as a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin and can be generated using methods that are well known in the art. Such a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can be both a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody against IGF 1R for example the IGF 1R blocking antibody 36491 Pharmingen San Diego Calif. or any other endogenous autoantigen receptor as well as antigen binding fragments of such antibodies including Fab F ab 2 Fd and Fv fragments and the like as long as the antibody or fragment by virtue of the inhibiting the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin reduces or inhibits fibroblast activation is a modulating substance useful for practicing the invention methods. In addition a modulating substances useful for practicing the methods of the invention can be a non naturally occurring antibody including for example a single chain antibody chimeric antibody bifunctional antibody complementarity determining region grafted CDR grafted antibody or humanized antibody as well as an antigen binding fragment thereof. Such an antibody antibody like molecule or fragment thereof is useful as a modulating substance as long as it inhibits the recruitment and infiltration of T lymphocytes.

Methods of preparing and isolating antibodies including polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies using peptide immunogens are well known to those skilled in the art and are described for example in Harlow and Lane Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1988 which is incorporated herein by reference. Non naturally occurring antibodies can be constructed using solid phase peptide synthesis can be produced recombinantly or can be obtained for example by screening combinatorial libraries consisting of variable heavy chains and variable light chains as described by Huse et al. 246 1275 1281 1989 which is incorporated herein by reference. These and other methods of making for example chimeric humanized CDR grafted single chain and bifunctional antibodies are well known to those skilled in the art Hoogenboom et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 564 332 issued Oct. 15 1996 Winter and Harris 14 243 246 1993 Ward et al. 341 544 546 1989 Hilyard et al. IRL Press 1992 Borrabeck 2d ed. Oxford University Press 1995 each of which is incorporated herein by reference .

A substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin so as to inhibit or reduce T lymphocyte recruitment or infiltration can be labeled so as to be detectable using methods well known in the art Hermanson Academic Press San Diego 1996 Harlow and Lane supra 1988 chap. 9 . For example a modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin can be linked to a radioisotope or therapeutic agent by methods well known in the art. A modulating substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin by directly binding to an endogenous autoantigen or to a disease specific immunoglobulin when linked to a radioisotope or other moiety capable of visualization can be useful to diagnose or stage the progression of a clinical stage of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

Methods for raising polyclonal antibodies for example in a rabbit goat mouse or other mammal are well known in the art Harlow and Lane supra 1988 . The production of anti peptide antibodies commonly involves the use of host animals such as rabbits mice guinea pigs or rats. If a large amount of serum is needed larger animals such as sheep goats horses pigs or donkeys can be used. Animals are usually chosen based on the amount of antiserum required and suitable animals include rabbits mice rats guinea pigs and hamsters. These animals yield a maximum of 10 50 L 100 200 L and 1 2 mL of serum per single bleed respectively Harlow and Lane supra 1988 . Rabbits are very useful for the production of polyclonal antisera since they can be safely and repeatedly bled and produce high volumes of antiserum. Two injections two to four weeks apart with 15 50 g of antigen in a suitable adjuvant such as for example Freund s Complete Adjuvant can be followed by blood collection and analysis of the antiserum.

In addition monoclonal antibodies can be obtained using methods that are well known and routine in the art Harlow and Lane supra 1988 . A peptide portion of a protein such as IGF 1R or as described further below of a chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES IL 16 or their respective receptors for use as an immunogen can be determined by methods well known in the art. Spleen cells from an immunized mouse can be fused to an appropriate myeloma cell line to produce hybridoma cells. Cloned hybridoma cell lines can be screened using a labeled protein to identify clones that secrete the corresponding antibodies respectively. Hybridomas expressing the monoclonal antibodies having a desirable specificity and affinity can be isolated and utilized as a continuous source of the antibody.

Humanized antibodies can be constructed by conferring essentially any antigen binding specificity onto a human antibody framework. Methods of constructing humanized antibodies are useful to prepare an antibody appropriate for practicing the methods of the invention and avoiding host immune responses against the antibody neutralizing agent when used therapeutically. The antibodies described herein can be used to generate therapeutic modulating substances for reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated.

T lymphocyte infiltration by methods well known in the art such as complementary determining region CDR grafting and optimization of framework and CDR residues. For example humanization of an antibody neutralizing agent can be accomplished by CDR grafting as described in Fiorentini et al. 3 1 45 59 1997 which is incorporated herein be reference. Briefly CDR grafting involves recombinantly splicing CDRs from a nonhuman antibody neutralizing agent into a human framework region to confer binding activity onto the resultant grafted antibody or variable region binding fragment thereof. Once the CDR grafted antibody or variable region binding fragment is made binding affinity comparable to the nonhuman antibody neutralizing agent can be reacquired by subsequent rounds of affinity maturation strategies known in the art. Humanization of a rabbit polyclonal antibody can be accomplished by similar methods as described in Rader et al. 275 18 13668 13676 2000 which is incorporated herein be reference.

Humanization of a nonhuman antibody useful as a modulating substance for practicing a method of the invention can also be achieved by simultaneous optimization of framework and CDR residues which permits the rapid identification of co operatively interacting framework and CDR residues as described in Wu et al. 294 1 151 162 1999 which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly a combinatorial library that examines a number of potentially important framework positions is expressed concomitantly with focused CDR libraries consisting of variants containing random single amino acid mutations in the third CDR of the heavy and light chains. By this method multiple Fab variants containing as few as one nonhuman framework residue and displaying up to approximately 500 fold higher affinity than the initial chimeric Fab can be identified. Screening of combinatorial framework CDR libraries permits identification of monoclonal antibodies with structures optimized for function including instances in which the antigen induces conformational changes in the monoclonal antibody. The enhanced humanized variants contain fewer nonhuman framework residues than antibodies humanized by sequential in vitro humanization and affinity maturation strategies known in the art.

It is further contemplated that a modulating substance useful for practicing a method of the invention can be a human antibody. Human antibodies can be produced by methods known in the art that involve immunizing a transgenic nonhuman animal with the desired antigen. The transgenic nonhuman animal can be modified such that it fails to produce endogenous antibodies but instead produces B cells which secrete fully human immunoglobulins. The antibodies produced can be obtained from the animal directly or from immortalized B cells derived from the transgenic nonhuman animal. Alternatively the genes encoding the immunoglobulins with human variable regions can be recovered and expressed to obtain the antibodies directly or modified to obtain analogs of antibodies such as for example single chain Fmolecules. Thus it is contemplated to produce a modulating substance useful for practicing a method of the invention that is a fully human immunoglobulin to a specific antigen or to produce an analog of the immunoglobulin by a process that includes immunizing a nonhuman animal with antigen under conditions that stimulate an immune response.

The nonhuman animal that produces a human antibody can be modified to be substantially incapable of producing endogenous heavy or light immunoglobulin chain but capable of producing immunoglobulins with both human variable and constant regions. In the resulting immune response the animal produces B cells which secrete immunoglobulins that are fully human and specific for the antigen for example IGF 1R RANTES or IL 16. The human immunoglobulin of desired specificity can be directly recovered from the animal for example from the serum or primary B cells can be obtained from the animal and immortalized. The immortalized B cells can be used directly as the source of human antibodies or alternatively the genes encoding the antibodies can be prepared from the immortalized B cells or from primary B cells of the blood or lymphoid tissue for example spleen tonsils lymph nodes bone marrow of the immunized animal and expressed in recombinant hosts with or without modifications to produce the immunoglobulin or its analogs. In addition the genes encoding the repertoire of immunoglobulins produced by the immunized animal can be used to generate a library of immunoglobulins to permit screening for those variable regions which provide the desired affinity. Clones from the library which have the desired characteristics can then be used as a source of nucleotide sequences encoding the desired variable regions for further manipulation to generate human antibodies or analogs with these characteristics using standard recombinant techniques. Various techniques for preparing human antibodies using transgenic nonhuman animals for example transgenic mice are well known in the art and described for example in Fishwild et al. 14 845 851 1996 Heijnen et al. 97 331 338 1996 Lonberg et al. 368 856 859 1994 Morrison 368 812 813 1994 Neuberger 14 826 1996 Chadd and Chamow 12 2 188 94 2001 Russel et al. 1820 1826 2000 Gallo et al. 30 534 540 2000 Davis et al. 18 4 421 5 1999 Green 231 11 23 1999 Yang et al. 66 401 410 1999 Jakobovits 31 33 42 1998 Green and Jakobovits 188 3 483 495 1998 Jakobovits 7 4 607 614 1998 Mendez et al. 15 146 156 1997 Jakobovits 194.1 194.7 1996 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore various techniques known in the art for preparation of a human antibody are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 162 963 6 150 584 6 114 598 6 111 166 6 096 311 and 6 075 181 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

As described herein an antibody can be modulating substance useful for practicing a method of the invention and can include for example a polyclonal antibody monoclonal antibody as well as recombinant versions and functional fragments thereof. Recombinant versions of antibodies include a wide variety of constructions ranging from simple expression and co assembly of encoding heavy and light chain cDNAs to specialty constructs termed designer antibodies. Recombinant methodologies combined with the extensive characterization of polypeptides within the immunoglobulin superfamily and particularly antibodies provides the ability to design and construct a vast number of different types styles and specificities of binding molecules derived from immunoglobulin variable and constant region binding domains. Specific examples include chimeric antibodies where the constant region of one antibody is substituted with that of another antibody and humanized antibodies described above where the complementarity determining regions CDR from one antibody are substituted with those from another antibody.

Other recombinant versions of antibodies include for example functional antibody variants where the variable region binding domain or functional fragments responsible for maintaining antigen binding is fused to an Freceptor binding domain from the antibody constant region. Such variants are essentially truncated forms of antibodies that remove regions non essential for antigen and Freceptor binding. Truncated variants can be have single valency for example or alternatively be constructed with multiple valencies depending on the application and need of the user. Additionally linkers or spacers can be inserted between the antigen and Fc receptor binding domains to optimize binding activity as well as contain additional functional domains fused or attached to effect biological functions other than for example binding to a receptor autoantigen so as to inhibit its interaction with an endogenous immunoglobulin binding to a chemoattractant molecule or its receptor to neutralize the cell recruitment activity of the chemoattractant molecule or binding to a chemoattractant molecule receptor to prevent the release of the chemoattractant molecule from a fibroblast cell. Those skilled in the art will know how to construct recombinant antibodies in light of the art knowledge regarding antibody engineering and given the guidance and teachings herein. A description of recombinant antibodies functional fragments and variants and antibody like molecules can be found for example in Antibody Engineering 2nd Edition Carl A. K. Borrebaeck Ed. Oxford University Press New York 1995 .

Additional functional variants of antibodies that can be used as modulating substances useful for practicing a method of the invention include antibody like molecules other than antigen binding Freceptor binding domain fusions. For example antibodies functional fragments and fusions thereof containing a Freceptor binding domain can be produced to be bispecific in that one variable region binding domain exhibits binding activity for one antigen and the other variable region binding domain exhibits binding activity for a second antigen. Such bispecific antibody neutralizing agents can be advantageous in the methods of the invention because a single bispecific antibody will contain two different target antigen binding species. Therefore a single molecular entity can be administered to achieve neutralization of for example both RANTES and IL 16.

An antibody useful as a modulating substance for practicing the method of the invention can also be an immunoadhesion or bispecific immunoadhesion. Immunoadhesions are antibody like molecules that combine the binding domain of a non antibody polypeptide with the effector functions of an antibody of an antibody constant domain. The binding domain of the non antibody polypeptide can be for example a ligand or a cell surface receptor having ligand binding activity. Immunoadhesions can contain at least the Freceptor binding effector functions of the antibody constant domain. Specific examples of ligands and cell surface receptors that can be used for the antigen binding domain of an immunoadhesion include for example a T cell receptor such as the CCR5 receptor that recognizes RANTES. It is understood that other ligands and ligand receptors known in the art can similarly be used for the antigen binding domain of an immunoadhesion. In addition multivalent and multispecific immunoadhesions can be constructed for use as a modulating substance for reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. The construction of bispecific antibodies immunoadhesions bispecific immunoadhesions and other heteromultimeric polypeptides which can be used in the invention methods is the individual matter of for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 807 706 and 5 428 130 which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention also provides a method of reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration by administering to a individual an effective amount of at least one modulating substance that modulating substance prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule that is normally released by fibroblasts and that attracts immunocompetent cells.

As further described below the chemoattractant molecule can be cytokine including a chemotactic cytokine more commonly referred to as a chemokine. In one embodiment of the invention method the chemoattractant molecule is a C C chemokine for example the chemoattractant molecule RANTES. In a further embodiment of the invention methods the chemoattractant molecule is a cytokine that serves as a specific CD4 ligand for example the chemoattractant molecule IL 16.

A successful host response to inflammation generally requires the accumulation of specialized host cells at the site of tissue damage. This cellular accumulation is a critical step in the normal inflammatory process and is mediated by a family of over forty structurally and functionally related proteins known as cytokines. Cytokines are soluble glycoproteins in the range of 5 20 kDa that are released by cells of the immune system and that act nonenzymatically through specific receptors to regulate immune responses. Cytokines resemble hormones in that they act at low concentrations bound with high affinity to a specific receptor.

Interleukin 16 IL 16 formerly known as lymphocyte chemoattractant factor or LCF is a CD4 cell specific cytokine detected in asthma RA Crohn s Disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. IL 16 is synthesized as a precursour molecule of 69 kDa and subsequently undergoes cleavage by caspase 3 which results in release of 17 kDa to 20 kDa polypeptides form the cell. Activity is subsequently conferred by the multimerization of four identical subunits to a 56 kDa molecule. IL 16 is a CD4 specific ligand that activates T lymphocytes monocytes and eosinophils displaying CD4. CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes airway epithelium B lymphocytes and mast cells can express IL 16. In addition IL 16 expression has been demonstrated in cytokine activated fibroblasts as described by Sciaky et al. 164 3806 2000 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Chemokines represent a subset of cytokines. Chemokines are homologous 8 to 10 kDa heparin binding proteins that possess a conserved structural motif containing two cysteine pairs and are divided into subfamilies based on the relative position of the cysteine residues in the mature protein. There are at least four subfamilies of chemokines but only two chemokines and chemokines have been well characterized. In the chemokines the first two cysteine residues are separated by a single amino acid CXC whereas in the chemokines the first two cysteine residues are adjacent to each other CC . The C X C chemokines include for example interleukin 8 IL 8 human platelet derived factors IP 10 and Mig. Members of the C C chemokine subfamily include for example regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted RANTES macrophage chemoattractant and activating factor MCAF macrophage inflammatory protein 1 MIP 1 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 MIP 1 .

Chemokines induce cell migration and activation in at least two ways first through direct chemoattraction and second by binding to specific G protein coupled cell surface receptors on target cells. Chemokines selectively attract leukocyte subsets some chemokines act specifically toward eosinophils others toward monocytes dendritic cells or T cells as reviewed by Luster 338 436 445 1998 which is incorporated herein by reference. In general CC chemokines chemoattract monocytes eosinophils basophils and T cells and signal through specific chemokine receptors. More than 10 distinct chemokine receptors each expressed on different subsets of leukocytes have been identified. Chemokine receptors are constitutively expressed on some cells whereas they are inducible on others.

RANTES utilizes at least four GTP protein coupled receptors including CCR5 and activates basophils eosinophils monocytes as well as resting and activated naive and memory T lymphocytes. In T lymphocytes RANTES engagement of CCR5 activates Janus kinase kinases and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and multiple downstream signaling pathways as described by Wong et al. 276 11427 2001 which is incorporated herein by reference.

As described herein release of the chemoattractant molecules IL 16 and RANTES by activated immunocompetent cells leads to the recruitment and infiltration of T lymphocytes. Once a tissue has been infiltrated with immunocompetent cells including T cells and monocytes these cells secrete high levels of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL 1. CD40 a member of the tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF alpha receptor family of surface molecules is expressed by a variety of cell types including nonlymphoid cells such as fibroblasts endothelia and epithelial cells in culture. Recent evidence suggests participation of the CD40 CD40 ligand bridge in the cross talk between resident thyroid cells and bone marrow derived cells recruited to the thyroid. Therefore once a tissue has been infiltrated with immunocompetent cells that secrete high levels of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL 1 a feedback loop can be initiated as fibroblasts respond by further propagating the inflammatory cascade.

As described herein the release by fibroblasts of a chemoattractant molecule that attracts immunocompetent cells for example T lymphocytes can be inhibited by reducing or preventing the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin. In a further embodiment the invention also can be practiced by administering to a individual an effective amount of at least one modulating substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by reducing the release by fibroblasts of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule that attracts immunocompetent cells. In a related embodiment the invention is practiced by administering to a individual an effective amount of at least one modulating substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule that is normally released by fibroblasts and that attracts immunocompetent cells.

A modulating substance that neutralizes the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 modulates the chemoattractant molecule sufficiently to reduce its activity related to cell recruitment. Such a neutralizing substance can be a macromolecule such as polypeptide nucleic acid carbohydrate or lipid. A modulating substance that neutralizes the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule can also be a derivative analogue or mimetic compound as well as a small organic compound as long as cell recruitment activity is reduced in the presence of the neutralizing agent. The types of molecules that can be neutralizing substances useful for practicing the methods of the invention as well as the methods of administration described herein with reference to chemoattractant molecules are equally applicable to both cytokines and chemokines. A neutralizing substance can be as little as between about one and six and as large as tens or hundreds of monomer building blocks which constitute a macromolecule or chemical binding molecule. Similarly an organic compound can be a simple or complex structure so long as it binds the targeted chemoattractant molecule with sufficient affinity to reduce activity. A substance that neutralizes a chemoattractant molecule can be a polypeptide nucleic acid or chemical compound as described herein and further can be identified via any of the methods described herein for identifying a modulating substance of the invention. In particular a substance that neutralizes a chemoattractant molecule can be an antisense polynucleotide directed to a polynucleotide encoding said chemokine a nucleotide aptamer that affects the binding of said chemokine to at least one chemokine receptor a peptide aptamer that affects the binding of said chemokine to at least one chemokine receptor and a small molecule that affects the binding of said chemokine to at least one chemokine receptor.

Therefore the library and screening methods described herein for identification of a substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin are equally applicable to identification of a substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16.

Neutralizing substances specific for a chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 can include antibodies and other receptor or ligand binding polypeptides of the immune system. Such other molecules of the immune system include for example T cell receptors TCR including CD4 cell receptors. Additionally cell surface receptors such as integrins growth factor receptors and chemokine receptors as well as any other receptors or fragments thereof that bind the chemoattractant molecule or can be made to bind the chemoattractant molecule with sufficient affinity to reduce activity are also neutralizing substances useful for practicing the methods of the invention. Additionally receptors growth factors cytokines or chemokines for example which inhibit the expression of the chemoattractant molecule or its receptor for example RANTES or IL 16 are also neutralizing substances useful for practicing the methods of the invention. Furthermore DNA binding polypeptides such as transcription factors and DNA replication factors are likewise included within the definition of the term binding molecule so long as they have selective binding activity for the targeted chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 or regulatory molecules that control the expression or activity of the targeted chemoattractant molecule or gene regions that control the expression of the targeted chemoattractant molecule. Finally polypeptides nucleic acids and chemical compounds such as those selected from random and combinational libraries as described above are also included within the definition of the term so long as such a molecule binds the targeted chemoattractant molecule with sufficient affinity to decrease cell recruitment activity.

Various approaches can be used for identifying a modulating substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 that is normally released by fibroblasts and that attracts immunocompetent cells. For example one approach is to use the information available regarding the structure and function of the targeted chemoattractant molecule to generate binding molecule populations from molecules known to function as cytokine binding molecules or known to exhibit or be capable of exhibiting binding affinity specific for the chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 such as fragments or mimetics of the CCR5 receptor found on CD4 T cells. A modulating substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 can be an antibody and other receptor of the immune repertoire. The normal function of such immune receptors is to bind essentially an infinite number of different antigens and ligands. Therefore generating a diverse population of binding molecules from an immune repertoire for example can be useful for identifying a modulating substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16.

A modulating substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 can further be identified from a large population of unknown molecules by methods well known in the art and described herein. Such a population can be a random library of peptides or small molecule compounds and can be generated to contain a sufficient diversity of sequence or structure so as to contain a modulating substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 or their respective nucleic acids. Those skilled in the art will know what size and diversity is necessary or sufficient for the intended purpose. A population of sufficient size and complexity can be generated so as to have a high probability of containing a modulating substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 with sufficient affinity to decrease cell recruitment activity. Numerous other types of library molecule populations exist and are described further below.

Any substance that binds to a receptor to a gene region that controls expression or to a regulatory molecule that modulates activity or expression of the targeted chemoattractant molecule as well as any substance that binds to a regulatory molecule that modulates receptor expression of the targeted chemoattractant molecule can be an inhibitory modulating substance useful for practicing the invention. Any substance that modulates or regulates activity or expression of the targeted chemoattractant molecule activity or expression of the corresponding receptor a gene region that controls expression of the targeted chemoattractant molecule or a regulatory molecule that modulates activity or expression of the targeted chemoattractant molecule as well as any regulatory molecule that modulates or regulates expression of the corresponding receptor is a modulating substance useful for practicing the invention. Thus a substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 can act directly through a binding or non binding interaction with the chemoattractant molecule itself as well as indirectly through a binding or non binding interaction with any other molecule that regulates or modulates expression or activity of the targeted chemoattractant molecule.

A substance can modulate the expression or activity of a targeted chemoattractant molecule sufficiently to decrease its activity is useful for practicing the claimed methods of reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration by preventing the influx of immunocompetent cells. In addition such a neutralizing modulating substance can decrease activity or expression of the chemoattractant molecule by modulating a corresponding receptor a regulatory molecule that in turn modulates the activity or expression of the chemoattractant molecule or a gene region that controls expression of the chemoattractant molecule. For example a substance useful for practicing the claimed invention can be an antibody against a regulator molecule that modulates expression or activity of the targeted chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16. For example an anti RANTES or anti L 16 antibody is a useful neutralizing substance for practicing the methods of the invention. In addition since chemoattractant molecules are secreted proteins known to bind to a specific T cell receptor a neutralizing substance useful for practicing the invention can be any binding polypeptide receptor or fragment thereof of the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors. Alternatively it may be desired to use populations of random peptide populations to identify further substances that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16. Based on the guidance provided herein and that which is known in the art those skilled in the art will know or can determine what type of approach and what type of neutralizing agent is appropriate for practicing the methods of the invention for reducing the severity of a of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

As described above for identification of a substance that inhibits the interaction between a receptor autoantigen and an endogenous immunoglobulin a moderate sized population for identification of a substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 can consist of hundreds and thousands of different molecules for example binding molecules within the population whereas a large population will consist of tens of thousands and millions of different molecule species. More specifically large and diverse populations of molecules for the identification of a substance useful for practicing the invention methods will contain any of about 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 or more different molecule species. One skilled in the art will know the approximate diversity of the population of molecules sufficient to identify a substance that prevents the influx of immunocompetent cells to affected tissues by neutralizing the activity of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16.

A antibody with specific binding activity for a chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 can be raised using as an immunogen a substantially purified chemoattractant molecule which can be prepared from natural sources or produced recombinantly or a peptide portion of the targeted chemoattractant molecule including synthetic peptides. A non immunogenic peptide portion of a chemoattractant molecule can be made immunogenic by coupling the hapten to a carrier molecule such bovine serum albumin BSA or keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH or by expressing the peptide portion as a fusion protein. Various other carrier molecules and methods for coupling a hapten to a carrier molecule are well known in the art see Harlow and Lane supra 1988 see also Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques Academic Press 1996 which is incorporated herein by reference . As described above an antibody useful as a substance that neutralizes the activity of a chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 can also be raised against a regulatory molecule that modulates the expression or activity of the targeted chemoattractant molecule rather than against the chemoattractant molecule directly.

In one embodiment of the invention the polynucleotides encoding IGF 1R RANTES IL 16 or regulatory molecules that modulate the expression or activity of these molecules or any fragment thereof or antisense molecules can be used as substances useful for practicing the invention for therapeutic purposes. As an example antisense molecules to the RANTES or IL 16 encoding nucleic acids can be used to block the transcription or translation of the mRNA. Specifically cells can be transformed with sequences complementary to these nucleic acids. Such methods are well known in the art and sense or antisense oligonucleotides or larger fragments can be designed from various locations along the coding or control regions of sequences encoding for example a targeted chemoattractant molecule. Thus antisense molecules may be used as substances to neutralize activity or to achieve regulation of gene function in the methods of the invention.

The activity of a chemoattractant as well as the neutralizing activity of a substance can be confirmed by in vitro assays known in the art. For example a chemotaxis assay can be used to evaluate the ability of defined signals to induce directional migration of a targeted cell population for example T lymphocytes. The activity of RANTES or IL 16 can be neutralized with for example a human monoclonal antibody and the effect of this treatment on T cell migration to the site of inflammation can be determined. A hallmark of chemokine binding to a specific chemokine receptor is a change in intracellular calcium levels. Intracellular calcium in single receptor expressing T cells can be determined using a digital imaging system with a light sensitive camera. Recombinant human proinflammatory molecule can be incubated with or without the candidate neutralizing substance and added to separate chambers of cells. The Ca2 i is determined before and after stimulation.

As described herein neutralization of a chemoattractant molecule also can be achieved by inhibiting the interaction between the chemoattractant molecule and its corresponding receptor for example a chemokine and a chemokine receptor a cytokine and a cytokine receptor. The substance inhibiting the interaction between the chemoattractant molecule and its receptor can be a modified chemoattractant molecule an antibody or fragment thereof that binds specifically to the chemoattractant molecule receptor an antisense polynucleotide directed to a polynucleotide encoding the chemoattractant molecule a nucleotide aptamer that affects the binding of the chemoattractant molecule to at least one chemoattractant molecule receptor a peptide aptamer that affects the binding of the chemoattractant molecule to at least one chemoattractant molecule receptor and a small molecule that affects the binding of the chemoattractant molecule to at least one chemoattractant molecule receptor. As an example the substance can be a modified RANTES molecule for example modified by addition of an aminooxypentane AOP group to the beginning of the protein sequence. Modified in this fashion AOP RANTES retains its capacity to bind CCR5 but cannot induce any of RANTES biological activities with regard to the attraction or activation of T cells. AOP RANTES can also displace other chemokines bound to CCR5 binding more tightly to the receptor. A chemically modified IL 16 molecule modified so as to retain its capacity to bind the CD4 receptor but without the capacity to induce any of IL 16 biological activities with regard to the attraction or activation of T cells also is useful for practicing the claimed methods. Furthermore a fragment or peptidomimetic of a chemoattractant molecule that binds the target chemoattractant molecule receptor with sufficient affinity to decrease its activity is useful for practicing the claimed methods.

The term specifically binds is intended to mean the polypeptide will have an affinity for the target polypeptide that is measurably higher than its affinity for a non specific interaction. A modified chemoattractant molecule a fragment or peptidomimetic of a chemoattractant molecule or an antibody or fragment thereof that can bind to the chemoattractant molecule receptor with low or high affinity so long as the binding is sufficient to inhibit the interaction between a chemoattractant molecule and its receptor. For example a modified chemoattractant molecule can bind to the corresponding chemoattractant molecule receptor with a binding affinity Kd of about 10M or less 10M or less 10M or less about 10M or less including about 10M or less such as 10M or less. Several methods for detecting or measuring polypeptide binding are known in the art.

The substances useful for practicing the methods of the invention can be formulated and administered by those skilled in the art in a manner and in an amount appropriate for the condition to be treated the rate or amount of inflammation the weight gender age and health of the individual the biochemical nature bioactivity bioavailability and side effects of the particular compound and in a manner compatible with concurrent treatment regimens. An appropriate amount and formulation for decreasing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration in humans can be extrapolated from credible animal models known in the art of the particular disorder. It is understood that the dosage of a therapeutic substance has to be adjusted based on the binding affinity of the substance such that a lower dose of a substance exhibiting significantly higher binding affinity can be administered compared to the dosage necessary for a substance with lower binding affinity.

The total amount of a substance can be administered as a single dose or by infusion over a relatively short period of time or can be administered in multiple doses administered over a more prolonged period of time. Such considerations will depend on a variety of case specific factors such as for example whether the disease category is characterized by acute episodes or gradual or chronic deterioration. For a individual affected with chronic deterioration for example as associated with neuroinflammatory disorder such as MS the substance can be administered in a slow release matrice which can be implanted for systemic delivery or at the site of the target tissue. Contemplated matrices useful for controlled release of therapeutic compounds are well known in the art and include materials such as DepoFoam biopolymers micropumps and the like.

The substances administered in the methods of the invention can be administered to the individual by any number of routes known in the art including for example systemically such as intravenously or intraarterially. A therapeutic substance can be provided in the form of isolated and substantially purified polypeptides and polypeptide fragments in pharmaceutically acceptable formulations using formulation methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These formulations can be administered by standard routes including for example topical transdermal intraperitoneal intracranial intracerebroventricular intracerebral intravaginal intrauterine oral rectal or parenteral e.g. intravenous intraspinal intrathecal subcutaneous or intramuscular routes. Intrathecal administration of a therapeutic substance into the intradural or subarachnoid space is a preferred route for practicing the methods of the invention for decreasing the severity of a neuroinflammatory condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. Intravenous administration of a therapeutic substance also is a preferred route for practicing the methods of the invention. In addition a therapeutic substance administered in the methods of the invention can be incorporated into biodegradable polymers allowing for sustained release of the substance useful for reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. Biodegradable polymers and their use are described for example in Brem et al. 74 441 446 1991 which is incorporated herein by reference.

A therapeutic substance administered in the methods of the invention also can be administered as a solution or suspension together with a pharmaceutically acceptable medium. Such a pharmaceutically acceptable medium can include for example sterile aqueous solvents such as sodium phosphate buffer phosphate buffered saline normal saline or Ringer s solution or other physiologically buffered saline or other solvent or vehicle such as a glycol glycerol an oil such as olive oil or an injectable organic ester. A pharmaceutically acceptable medium can additionally contain physiologically acceptable compounds that act for example stabilize the neutralizing agent increase its solubility or increase its absorption. Such physiologically acceptable compounds include for example carbohydrates such as glucose sucrose or dextrans antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or glutathione receptor mediated permeabilizers which can be used to increase permeability of the blood brain barrier chelating agents such as EDTA which disrupts microbial membranes divalent metal ions such as calcium or magnesium low molecular weight proteins lipids or liposomes or other stabilizers or excipients. Those skilled in the art understand that the choice of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier depends on the route of administration of the compound containing the neutralizing substance and on its particular physical and chemical characteristics.

Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non aqueous sterile injection solutions such as the pharmaceutically acceptable mediums described above. The solutions can additionally contain for example buffers bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Other formulations include for example aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which can include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations can be presented in unit dose or multi dose containers for example sealed ampules and vials and can be stored in a lyophilized condition requiring for example the addition of the sterile liquid carrier immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders granules and tablets of the kind previously described.

For applications that require the compounds and compositions to cross the blood brain barrier formulations that increase the lipophilicity of the compound are particularly desirable. For example the neutralizing agent can be incorporated into liposomes Gregoriadis 2nd ed. CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1993 . Liposomes which consist of phospholipids or other lipids are nontoxic physiologically acceptable and metabolizable carriers that are relatively simple to make and administer.

A therapeutic substance administered in the methods of the invention can also be prepared as nanoparticles. Adsorbing peptide compounds onto the surface of nanoparticles has proven effective in delivering peptide drugs to the brain see Kreuter et al. 674 171 174 1995 . Exemplary nanoparticles are colloidal polymer particles of poly butylcyanoacrylate with a therapeutic substance to be administered in the methods of the invention adsorbed onto the surface and then coated with polysorbate 80.

Image guided ultrasound delivery of a therapeutic substance administered in the methods of the invention through the blood brain barrier to selected locations in the brain can be utilized as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 752 515. Briefly to deliver a therapeutic substance past the blood brain barrier a selected location in the brain is targeted and ultrasound used to induce a change detectable by imaging in the central nervous system CNS tissues and or fluids at that location. At least a portion of the brain in the vicinity of the selected location is imaged for example via magnetic resonance imaging MRI to confirm the location of the change. An therapeutic substance administered in the methods of the invention into the individual s bloodstream can be delivered to the confirmed location by applying ultrasound to effect opening of the blood brain barrier at that location and thereby to induce uptake of the substance.

In addition polypeptides called receptor mediated permeabilizers RMP can be used to increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier to molecules such as therapeutic or diagnostic substances as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 268 164 5 506 206 and 5 686 416. These receptor mediated permeabilizers can be intravenously co administered to a host with molecules whose desired destination is the cerebrospinal fluid compartment of the brain for example in the treatment of a autoimmune neuroinflammatory condition. The permeabilizer polypeptides or conformational analogues thereof allow therapeutic substances to penetrate the blood brain barrier and arrive at their target destination.

In current treatment regimes for autoimmune diseases more than one compound is often administered to an individual for management of the same or different aspects of the disease. Similarly in the methods of the invention involving reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration a therapeutic substance can advantageously be formulated with a second therapeutic compound such as an anti inflammatory compound immunosuppressive compound or any other compound that manages the same or different aspects of the disease. Such compounds include for example methylprednisolone acetate dexamethasone and betamethasone. As an example for treatment of Graves disease a therapeutic substance can advantageously be formulated with a second therapeutic compound such as antithyroid drugs including propylthiouracil PTU and methimazole Tapazole beta adrenergic blocking drugs including atenolol Tenormin nadolol Corgard metoprolol Lopressor and propranolol Inderal and radioiodine.

Contemplated methods of reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration include administering a therapeutic substance useful in the methods of the invention alone in combination with or in sequence with such other compounds. Alternatively combination therapies can consist of fusion proteins where the therapeutic substance useful in the methods of the invention is linked to a heterologous protein such as a therapeutic protein.

The invention also provides a method of diagnosing or predicting the susceptibility to an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration in a individual suspected of having a such a disease by obtaining a test tissue sample of the individual measuring the level of antibodies specific for the IGF 1 Receptor and comparing the measured expression levels of antibodies to levels of antibodies from a control tissue sample wherein a 2 fold or more increase of antibody levels in the test sample compared to the control sample indicates the presence of an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

The invention further provides method of diagnosing or predicting the susceptibility to an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration in a individual suspected of having such a disease by obtaining a test tissue sample of the individual measuring the level of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule capable of recruiting T lymphocytes and comparing the measured expression levels of the chemoattractant molecule to levels from a control tissue sample wherein a 2 fold or more increase in the measured level of the chemoattractant molecule in the test sample compared to the control sample indicates the presence of an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

As used herein the term sample is intended to mean any biological fluid cell tissue organ or portion thereof that includes or potentially includes disease specific auto antibodies for example anti IFG1R or a chemoattractant molecule associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte recruitment. The term includes samples present in an individual as well as samples obtained or derived from the individual. For example a sample can be a histologic section of a specimen obtained by biopsy or cells that are placed in or adapted to tissue culture. A sample further can be a subcellular fraction or extract or a crude or substantially pure nucleic acid or polypeptide preparation.

The diagnostic and prognostic methods of the invention are useful for determining if a individual is at risk for or afflicted with an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration in an individual. The diagnostic and prognostic methods of the invention can be used to identify individuals likely to experience an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration in an individual so that suitable therapies can be offered.

Autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration include for example Graves Disease and the Rheumatoid Arthritis. As described herein based on the existence of trauma induced autoimmunity by which the autoreactive repertoire regulates ongoing central nervous system CNS immunologic responses the diagnostic and predictive methods of the invention also are applicable in the context of CNS trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. The methods herein are applicable for the diagnosis or treatment of any or all conditions associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

The invention provides a method of diagnosing or predicting an autoimmune condition based on the finding of a positive correlation between the expression of auto antibodies directed against the IFG1Receptor on fibroblasts cells and the degree or extent of the condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. The diagnostic methods of the invention are applicable to numerous conditions and pathologies as described above. One consequence of progression into these conditions is an increased expression of IgGs that specifically bind to the IGF 1 Receptor which serves as the autoantigen. This increase in anti IGF 1R antibody expression in individuals suffering from a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can be measured by comparing the amount or concentration of anti IGF 1R antibody to that found for example in normal blood lymph or tissue samples for example lymph node samples. A two fold or more increase in anti IGF 1R antibody expression in a test sample relative to samples obtained from control tissue sample is indicative of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. Similarly an increase in anti IGF 1R antibody expression leading to two fold or more secretion into the blood or other circulatory fluids of the individual compared to normal blood or fluid samples also is indicative of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

As a diagnostic indicator anti IGF 1R antibodies can be used qualitatively to positively identify a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration as described above. Alternatively anti IGF 1R antibodies also can be used quantitatively to determine the degree of or susceptibility to a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. For example successive increases in the expression levels including levels of anti IGF 1R antibodies in circulating fluids can be used as a predictive indicator of the degree or severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration for example Graves disease or Rheumatoid Arthritis because increased expression leading to a rise in accumulated levels for example also can positively correlate with increased severity of such a condition. The higher the level of auto antibody expression the later the stage of the condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. Disease specific auto antibodies and chemoattractant molecules associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration also can be used quantitatively to distinguish between distinguish between the different types of autoimmune conditions.

Correlative increases can be determined by comparison of disease specific auto antibodies or chemoattractant molecules associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration from the individual having or suspected of having a particular condition to corresponding expression levels from known samples determined to exhibit the particular condition. Alternatively correlative increases also can be determined by comparison of disease specific auto antibodies or chemoattractant molecules associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration expression from the test individual in combination with expression levels of other known markers of a particular condition such as for example thyrotropin antibodies directed against the Thyrotropin receptor anti TSH R antibodies or thyroid hormone levels in Graves individuals SR proteins or anti SR autoantibody levels for systemic lupus erythematosus see Neugebauer et al. 43 8 1768 78 2000 . Similarly other known markers associated with particular autoimmune diseases can be used for example as an internal or external standard for correlation of stage specific expression with increases in the expression of other known markers associated with a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. Conversely a regression in the severity of a condition or pathology can be followed by a corresponding decrease in disease specific auto antibodies or chemoattractant molecules expression levels and can similarly be assessed using the methods described above.

Given the teachings and guidance provided herein those skilled in the art will know or can determine the stage or severity of a particular condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration based on a determination of disease specific auto antibody or chemoattractant molecule expression and using known procedures and marker comparisons other than those described above. For a review of recognized values for such other marker in normal versus pathological tissues see for example Endocrinology Degroot and Jameson Eds. 4th ed. 2001 W B Saunders Philadelphia Werner and Ingbar s the Thyroid A Fundamental and Clinical Text Braverman and Utiger Eds. 7ed. 1996 Lippincott Philadelphia both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Therefore the invention provides a method for both diagnosing and prognosing a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration for example Graves disease GD and Rheumatoid Arthritis RA as well as other autoimmune conditions.

The use of disease specific auto antibody or chemoattractant molecule expression levels in tissue samples or samples obtained from the circulatory system as a diagnostic indicator of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration allows for early diagnosis as a predictive indicator when no physiological or pathological symptoms are apparent. The methods are applicable to any individuals suspected of being afflicted with or at risk for an autoimmune disease for example women in their childbearing years with a family history of autoimmune diseases. In this regard it is known that about 75 percent of autoimmune diseases occur in women most often during their childbearing years. A genetic component of autoimmune diseases is suspected since multiple family members may be affected although not always with the same disease. For Graves disease studies have shown that 75 of monozygotic twins are discordant for the disease. Because the severity of the disease can change after pregnancy or menopause hormones also are suspected to play a role. In addition onset may follow viral or bacterial infections suggesting that autoimmune diseases can be triggered by certain pathogens that ultimately cause an abnormal immune response against the body.

Taking into account the above cited and other art known risk factors the diagnostic methods of the invention are applicable to individuals predicted to be at risk for a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration prior to onset of overt clinical symptoms. By determining the expression levels of a disease specific auto antibody for example anti IGF 1R antibody or a chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 in tissue test samples or test samples obtained from the circulatory system and comparing the measured level to that of an appropriate control sample it is possible to determine whether there is an increase in these levels in the individual suspected of having a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration compared to normal individuals. Those skilled in the art will know by using routine examinations and practices in the field of medicine those individuals who are candidates for diagnosis by the methods of the invention.

For example individuals suspected of having a particular autoimmune condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can be identified by exhibiting presenting signs of the particular condition which are known in the art and depend on the specific disease and the organ or tissue that is affected but generally can include for example low grade fever malaise and fatigue. Prognostic methods of this invention also are applicable to individuals after diagnosis of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration for example to monitor improvements or identify a remission.

Therefore the invention provides a method of predicting the onset of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. The method consists of determining increased expression levels of a disease specific auto antibody for example anti IGF 1R antibody or a chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 in a test sample from an individual having or suspected of having a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration and comparing the measured expression level to a control sample isolated from a normal individual where an increased expression level of a disease specific auto antibody for example anti IGF 1R antibody or a chemoattractant molecule for example RANTES or IL 16 in the sample indicates the onset of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

The diagnostic methods of the invention are applicable for use with a variety of different types of samples isolated or obtained from an individual having or suspected of having a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. For example samples applicable for use in one or more diagnostic formats of the invention include tissue and cell samples. A tissue or cell sample can be obtained for example by biopsy or surgery. As described below and depending on the format of the method the tissue can be used whole or can be disassociated into smaller pieces cell aggregates or individual cells. When measuring polypeptide or activity levels amplification of the signal with enzymatic coupling or photometric enhancement can be employed using only a few or a small number of cells. Whole tissue obtained from a biopsy of for example a lymph node is one example of a cell sample. Of particular interest for practicing the invention methods fibroblast strains for example orbital fibroblasts can be initiated from surgical waste. Dermal fibroblasts can be derived for example from punch biopsies or obtained from a third party source for example the American Type Culture Collection ATCC . Whole tissue cell samples can be assayed employing any of the formats described below.

Individual cells and cell aggregates from an individual having or suspected of having a particular condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration is another example of a cell sample which can be analyzed for increased expression of polypeptide or activity. The tissue or cell sample can be obtained directly from the individual or alternatively it can be obtained from other sources for testing. Similarly the cell sample can be tested when it is freshly isolated or it can be tested following short or prolonged periods of cryopreservation without substantial loss in accuracy or sensitivity. If the sample is to be tested following an indeterminate period of time it can be obtained and then cryopreserved or stored at 4 C. for short periods of time for example. An advantage of the diagnostic methods of the invention is that they do not require histological analysis of the sample. As such the sample can be initially desegregated lysed fractionated or purified and the active component stored for later diagnosis.

Fluid samples that can be measured for expression levels of for example a disease specific immunoglobulin or autoantibody autoantigen chemoattractant molecule include for example blood serum and lymph. Other bodily fluids are known to those skilled in the art and are similarly applicable for use as a sample in the diagnostic methods of the invention. One advantage of analyzing fluid samples is that they are readily obtainable in sufficient quantity without invasive procedures as required by biopsy and surgery. Analysis of fluid samples such as blood serum and lymph will generally be in the diagnostic formats described above and below which measure levels or activity. As the polypeptide is circulating the methods will be similar to those which measure expression levels from cell lysates fractionated portions thereof or purified components.

A suitable control for comparison can be a sample obtained from a donor individual known not to have the particular condition targeted by the diagnostic or prognostic method. The control sample for comparison can be measured simultaneously with one or more test samples or alternatively expression levels can be established for a particular type of sample and standardized to internal or external parameters such as protein content cell number or mass of tissue. Such standardized control samples can then be directly compared with results obtained from the test sample. An increase of two fold or more of for example a disease specific immunoglobulin or autoantibody autoantigen chemoattractant molecule expression levels indicates the presence of the particular condition in the tested individual.

The diagnostic procedures described above and below can additionally be used in conjunction with other biomarkers such as for example anti TSHR antibodies in the case of Graves disease GD for simultaneous or independent corroboration of a sample. Those skilled in the art will know which markers are applicable for use in conjunction with a particular condition to delineate more specific diagnostic information such as that described above.

Therefore the invention provides a method of diagnosing or predicting the susceptibility to an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration in an individual suspected of having such a disease by obtaining a test tissue sample of the individual measuring the level of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule capable of recruiting T lymphocytes and comparing the measured expression levels of the type of chemoattractant molecule to levels of chemoattractant molecules from a control tissue sample. A 2 fold or more increase in the measured level of the type of chemoattractant molecule in the test sample compared to the control sample indicates the presence of an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. Further as described herein the invention provides a method of diagnosing or predicting the susceptibility to an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration in an individual suspected of having such a disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration by obtaining a test tissue sample of the individual measuring the level of antibodies specific for the IGF 1 Receptor and comparing the measured expression levels of antibodies to levels of antibodies from a control tissue sample wherein a 2 fold or more increase of antibody levels in the test sample compared to the control sample of antibodies indicates the presence of an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

In a further embodiment the invention provides a method of identifying a substance that modulates fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration by inducing fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration in a population of cells contacting a first sub population of the cells with a test substance and a second sub population of the cells with a control substance and comparing the amount of fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration between the first and second sub populations of cells wherein a difference in the amount of fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration between the first and second sub populations of cells indicates that the test substance modulates fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

In a related embodiment the invention provides a method of identifying a substance capable of modulating the interaction between an IGF 1 Receptor and an endogenous immunoglobulin by contacting a sample containing the IGF 1 Receptor and an endogenous immunoglobulin with a test substance under conditions that allow for the interaction between the IGF 1 Receptor and the endogenous immunoglobulin and measuring the interaction between the IGF 1 Receptor and the endogenous immunoglobulin wherein a decrease in the amount of interaction between the IGF 1 Receptor and the endogenous immunoglobulin in the presence of the test substance compared to the absence of the test substance indicates that the substance is capable of modulating the interaction between the IGF 1 Receptor and the endogenous immunoglobulin.

A substance capable of modulating the interaction between an IGF 1 Receptor and an endogenous immunoglobulin can decrease the amount of interaction. Such a substance is useful in the therapeutic embodiments of the invention directed to reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

The invention also provides a method of identifying a substance capable of inhibiting the release of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule from fibroblasts by contacting a fibroblast cell sample with a test substance under conditions that are associated with the release of the chemoattractant and measuring the amount of the chemoattractant that is released from the fibroblast cell sample wherein a decrease in the amount of the chemoattractant that is released from the sample in the presence of the test substance compared to the absence of the test substance indicates that the substance is capable of inhibiting the release of the type of chemoattractant molecule from fibroblasts. The fibroblast cell sample can be contacted with a control substance under conditions that are associated with the release of said type of chemoattractant molecule for example a chemokine such as the C C chemokine RANTES or a cytokine such as the specific CD4 ligand IL 16. For example the fibroblast cell sample can be contacted with disease specific antibodies that are known to specifically bind and activate an autoantigen receptor resulting in the subsequent release of a chemoattractant molecule that recruits immunocompetent cells. In addition as described in Example IV induction of IL 16 expression and release of this chemoattractant molecule from fibroblasts involves the FRAP mTOR pathway and activation of the serine threonine kinase p70. This pathway can be inhibited by the macrolide rapamycin as described by Brennan et al. 19 4729 1999 which is incorporated herein by reference. Thus rapamycin is a modulating substance that can prevent the release by a fibroblasts of a chemoattractant molecule. Similarly the release of the chemoattractant molecule IL 16 from fibroblasts is caspase 3 dependent Example III such that a caspase 3 inhibitor is a further modulating substance that can prevent the release by a fibroblasts of a chemoattractant molecule.

As described herein a substance capable of inhibiting the release of at least one type of chemoattractant molecule from fibroblasts represents a modulating substance useful in the therapeutic embodiments of the invention directed to reducing the severity of a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. A suitable test sample can be a fibroblast cell sample obtained from an individual afflicted with an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. A suitable fibroblast test sample can contain cells that express the autoantigen and can be obtained for example by punch biopsy from the dermis or from a site of tissue remodeling of an individual known to be afflicted with a condition associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in the methods described herein the absence of a test substance can represent the presence of a control substance.

In order to confirm the modulatory activity of a test substance it is necessary to induce the conditions that are associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. Such a condition can be induced for example by exposing the fibroblast test and control samples to an immunoglobulin obtained from an individual afflicted with an autoimmune disease associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration for example Graves disease GD a manifestation of Graves disease GD associated with connective tissue remodeling such Thyroid associated opthalmopathy TAO and dermopathy Rheumatoid Arthritis or a condition associated with neuroinflammation.

Fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can be induced in a variety of ways. Any compound or process that results in fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can be used to induce this process in the methods of the invention. For example compounds that mimic the endogenous anti IFG1R immunoglobulin or a chemoattractant molecule that is naturally released by fibroblasts to attract T lymphocytes can be used in the screening methods of the invention. Induction of fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can occur through activation of IFG1R or through other mechanisms. Likewise activation of IFG1R can occur through the binding of an endogenous immunoglobulin or a different compound. For example a truncated form of an anti IFG1 immunoglobulin that retains the ability to bind to the IGF 1R and lead to fibroblast activation can induce fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

It is understood that a fragment of an endogenous immunoglobulin that recognizes IFG1R can be sufficient in order to induce the conditions that are associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. For example a fragment of an endogenous immunoglobulin that retains substantially the same ability to specifically bind to IFG1R as the entire polypeptide is useful for practicing the invention methods. A fragment of a chemoattractant molecule that recognizes its corresponding receptor can similarly be sufficient to produce the conditions that are associated with fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. Fragments can include for example amino terminal carboxyl terminal or internal deletions of a full length substance chemoattractant molecule. For example a fragment can contain at least about 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 or more contiguous or non contiguous amino acid residues of a full length polypeptide. Polypeptide fragments can be generated for example using recombinant DNA methods or enzymatic or chemical cleavage of larger polypeptides. In addition various molecules such as other polypeptides carbohydrates or lipids or small molecules can be attached to a chemoattractant molecule or an endogenous immunoglobulin including fragments of these molecules. For example a label moiety can be attached to a chemoattractant molecule.

It is understood that limited modifications can be made to an antibody without destroying its specific binding activity with regard to for example an autoantigen such as IFG1R. Various modifications of the primary amino acid sequence can result in polypeptides having substantially equivalent decreased or enhanced function as compared to the endogenous immunoglobulin. Those skilled in the art recognize that such modifications can be desirable at times in order to enhance the bioactivity bioavailability or stability of a polypeptide or to facilitate its synthesis or purification. Contemplated amino acid substitutions to the native sequence of a polypeptide can include for example conservative changes wherein a substitutive amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties for example replacement of a polar amino acid with another polar amino acid or replacement of a charged amino acid with a similarly charged amino acid. Those skilled in the art also recognize that non conservative changes for example replacement of an uncharged polar amino acid with a non polar amino acid or replacement of a charged amino acid with an uncharged polar amino acid can also be made without affecting a function of a polypeptide such as an anti IFG1R antibody or a chemoattractant molecule. In addition a variety of polypeptide modifications are known in the art for constraining the structure of polypeptides to enhance stability or binding Cabezas and Satterthwait supra 1999 Stanfield et al. supra 1999 .

Cells used in the screening methods of the invention can include primary cells as well as cell lines. Primary cells in a tissue section or grown in cell culture can be used in the invention. For example human fibroblasts can be used in the methods of the invention and can be grown in cell culture either in an isolated form or with other cells that can be used to provide better growth of the fibroblasts. In addition the fibroblasts can be used in the invention as a tissue slice for example a lymph node tissue slice that is used directly after isolation or that has been maintained in tissue culture. Cell and tissue culture techniques are well known in the art.

Cell lines can also be used in the methods of the invention. Several neuronal and non neuronal cell lines have been established and are well known in the art. Appropriate cell lines are available from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC or from individual investigators. In addition cells can be isolated from an individual afflicted with a particular disease and immortalized by methods well known in the art. Non fibroblast cell lines can be used in the invention for example any cell line that can be transfected with IFG1R. Non neuronal cell lines that can be transfected include for example 293T HeLa COS 7 and Jurkat cells among others. Transfection techniques such as calcium phosphate lipids and electroporation are well known in the art. Furthermore stem cells or other pluripotent cells can be used in the invention. These cells can be used either as primary cells or cell lines in either an undifferentiated or differentiated state.

The level of fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can be measured by any of a variety of methods known to one skilled in the art. For example a chemotaxis assay can be used to evaluate the directional migration of T lymphocytes. Once fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration has been induced in a cell the invention methods contemplate contacting the cell with a test substance to identify a substance that modulates fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. The methods provided by the invention are particularly useful to identify from among a diverse population of molecules those substances that modulate fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. Methods for producing libraries containing diverse populations of molecules including chemical or biological molecules such as simple or complex organic molecules peptides proteins peptidomimetics glycoproteins lipoproteins polynucleotides and the like are well known in the art Huse U.S. Pat. No. 5 264 563 Blondelle et al. 14 83 92 1995 York et al. 274 1520 1522 1996 Gold et al. 94 59 64 1997 Gold U.S. Pat. No. 5 270 163 . Such libraries also can be obtained from commercial sources.

Since libraries of diverse molecules can contain as many as 10to 10different molecules a screening assay of the invention provides a simple means for identifying those substances in the library that can modulate fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration. In particular a screening assay of the invention can be automated which allows for high through put screening of randomly designed libraries of agents to identify those particular agents that can modulate fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration.

A screening assay can assay two or more samples simultaneously in order to identify a substance with the desired activity. Several formats are available for screening which can allow for a low number or high number of samples to be screened simultaneously. For example 10 100 1000 10 000 100 000 1 000 000 or more compounds can be assayed simultaneously using low or high thorough put formats. Screening assays often utilize isolated cells or tissues but can also use a cell free system such as a chemical or biological solution or a cell free extract derived from cells. In addition a screening assay could utilize whole organisms or animals. As understood by one skilled in the art the particular design of a screening assay depends on the desired activity of the compound one is seeking and the available reagents.

As described below substance that modulates fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can be a compound or molecule that binds IFG1R or any other molecule with sufficient affinity to modulate fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration and can be a macromolecule such as polypeptide nucleic acid carbohydrate or lipid. Thus a substance that modulates fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can be an antibody antisense nucleic acid and any compound identified by the methods described below. A substance that modulates fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can also be a derivative analogue or mimetic compound as well as a small organic compound as long as fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration is modulated in the presence of the compound. The size of a substance that modulates fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration compound is not important so long as the molecule exhibits or can be made to exhibit such modulating activity. For example a substance that modulates fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can be as little as between about one and six and as large as tens or hundreds of monomer building blocks which constitute a macromolecule or chemical binding molecule. Similarly an organic compound can be a simple or complex structure so long as it has sufficient activity.

A substance that modulates fibroblast mediated T lymphocyte infiltration can be incorporated in a therapeutic formulation that increases target specificity. For example a particular cell type for example fibroblast monocyte or macrophage may express a unique cell surface marker cell surface receptor or a ligand for a particular receptor. In such a case an antibody for example a disease specific IgG can be raised against the unique cell surface marker and a modulating substance can be linked to the antibody. Upon administration of the drug antibody complex to the individual the binding of the antibody to the cell surface marker results in the targeted delivery of a relatively high concentration of the substance. The modulating substance also can be linked to the specific ligand or to the receptor respectively thus providing a means to target a relatively high concentration.

Various cell types can express unique markers and therefore provide potential targets for homing molecules that can target a modulating substance of the invention to a desired cell type for example fibroblasts.

Those skilled in the art know how to identify specific target cell markers that are expressed in only one or a few tissues or and to identify molecules that specifically interact with such markers. Various cell types can express unique markers and therefore provide potential targets for homing molecules. Methods are now available for producing large populations of molecules and for screening libraries of molecules to identify those of interest for example phage peptide display libraries can be used to express large numbers of peptides that can be screened in vitro with a particular target molecule or a cell of interest in order to identify peptides that specifically bind a target molecule or cell. Screening of such phage display libraries has been used for example to identify ligands that specifically bind various antibodies and cell surface receptors. Screening of a phage display library generally involves in vitro panning of the library using a purified target molecule. Phage that bind the target molecule can be recovered individual phage can be cloned and the peptide expressed by a cloned phage can be determined. Such a peptide can be useful for delivery of a substance linked to the peptide to cells expressing the target molecule for example fibroblasts.

Accordingly the following examples are intended to illustrate but not limit the present invention.

This example demonstrates that serum from individuals with Graves disease elicits IgG mediated release of lymphocyte chemoattraction activity from fibroblasts.

Human fibroblasts derived from individuals with Graves disease and from normal donors that are maintained under basal culture conditions release very low levels of chemoattractant activity when the conditioned medium in which they are incubated is subjected to cell migration assays using NWNA T lymphocytes as the targets.

Briefly the results described herein were obtained utilizing human fibroblasts from individuals with Graves disease or from donors without known thyroid disease. Orbital fibroblast strains were initiated from surgical waste. Dermal fibroblasts were derived from punch biopsies of normal appearing skin or were purchased from American Type Tissue Collection Rockville Md. . All individuals were thought to be euthyroid at the time of tissue donation. Sera were collected from individuals with Graves disease either without or with clinically apparent TAO and from individuals without thyroid disease controls . These included adult men and women. The diagnosis of Graves disease was made on clinical grounds including suppressed TSH elevated serum T4 levels the presence of anti thyroid antibodies goiter and typical symptoms and signs of thyrotoxicosis. Most of the individuals were euthyroid at the time of blood drawing while few were hyperthyroid. IgG was prepared by the method previously described using protein A as described by Hardy in Handbook of Experimental Immunology Volume I Immunochemistry D. M. Weir ed. Oxford Blackwell Scientific 1986 . Fibroblast monolayers were covered with Eagle s medium supplemented with 10 FBS antibiotics and glutamine as described by Smith 74 2157 1984 . The cultures were incubated in a 37 C. humidified 5 COatmosphere and were serially passaged with gentle treatment with trypsin EDTA. Fibroblast strains were utilized between the third and twelfth passage. They have been shown to not express Factor VIII or smooth muscle specific actin Smith et al. 80 2620 1995 . There were no differences in the morphology of cultures from normal controls and individuals with Graves disease.

As shown in the upper panel of when unfractionated serum from a individual with Graves disease is added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1 covering fibroblast monolayers in this case from orbit subcutaneous connective tissue and thyroid derived from a single donor and incubated for 24 hours T lymphocyte chemoattractive activity is dramatically increased. A substantial fraction of the up regulated chemotaxis can be blocked by anti IL 16 monoclonal antibody white column 5 g ml added to the migration assay. The black column represents chemotaxis in the absence of the anti IL 16 monoclonal antibody. Migration of 0.135 was significant at a 5 confidence limit.

Briefly for the various chemotaxis assays described herein fibroblasts were plated in 24 well plates and were allowed to proliferate to confluence. After rinsing the monolayers with phosphate buffered saline PBS cultures were shifted to medium containing 1 FBS overnight before addition of nothing control IL 1 10 ng ml human serum final concentration 1 or protein A purified human IgG to the medium. Cultures were incubated for the times indicated in the text and figure legends. At the end of these incubations culture medium was collected quantitatively and stored at 800 C. until assayed.

Chemotaxis was assessed in a modified Boyden chemotaxis chamber utilizing human NWNA T lymphocytes as the cellular targets as described previously 30 . Briefly 50 l of a cell suspension 107 cells ml were placed in the upper compartments of 48 well micro chemotaxis chambers separated from 32 l of samples by 8 m micropore nitrocellulose filters Neuroprobe Cabin John Md. and subsequently incubated at 370 C. in 5 CO2 environment for 3 hours. Filters were fixed stained with hematoxylin dehydrated and mounted on glass slides and viewed under light microscopy. Lymphocyte migration was quantified by counting the total number of cells migrating beyond a certain depth set routinely to identify a baseline migration under control conditions of 10 to 15 cells per high power field. Five high power fields were counted in duplicate for each sample and the means and standard deviations were calculated and expressed as percentage values of baseline cell migration in control buffer alone 100 . For each set of experimental conditions at least three separate experiments were performed and the differences between experimental and control conditions were analyzed by the Student t test using the absolute values obtained for lymphocyte migration with statistical significance accepted at the 5 level of confidence.

To assess the chemoattractant activity attributable to IL 16 neutralizing experiments were conducted by incubating culture supernatants for 15 minutes with affinity purified anti IL 16 mAb clone 14.1 10 g ml which neutralizes the chemoattractant activity of 50 ng ml rIL 16 . The affinity purified polyclonal rabbit anti rIL 16 Ab was prepared from rIL 16 immunized rabbit sera as described by Cruikshank et al. 91 5109 1994 . To determine the RANTES dependent fraction anti RANTES mAb 5 g ml possessing an ND50 of 200 ng ml for rRANTES was added to the migration assay. An ELISA assay for RANTES was purchased from BioSource and neutralizing anti RANTES antibodies were purchased from R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. .

Also shown in lower panel when fibroblast medium from Graves disease serum treated fibroblasts was subjected to a specific IL 16 ELISA levels of the chemoattractant were found to be greatly elevated. IL 16 was undetectable in control cultures.

Briefly results described herein that involve the quantitation of IL 16 protein released from the fibroblast monolayers were obtained by subjecting aliquots of conditioned medium to a specific ELISA assay performed as described by Sciaky et al. 164 3806 2000 . Samples from each culture were assayed in duplicate and rIL 16 and aliquots of conditioned medium were diluted in PBS to the desired concentrations. Samples of culture medium 100 l were incubated in a 96 well microtiter plate Nunc Naperville Ill. at 37 C. for 1 hr. Subsequent maneuvers were performed at room temperature.

As shown in IL 16 inducing activity was completely adsorbed from Graves disease sera when they were subjected to protein A column chromatography. The effluent failed to influence T cell migration. As described above normal and Graves disease orbital fibroblasts were treated for 24 h with serum 1 IgG fraction 100 ng ml or effluent from protein A chromatography. Media were subjected to the T cell chemotaxis assay in the absence or presence of anti IL 16 neutralizing antibody 5 g ml . The data are expressed as the means SD of three independent determinations. T cell migration greater than 135 was significant at the 5 confidence limit.

As shown in the left panel of a high degree of correlation was found between the up regulation of IL 16 dependent T cell migration and IL 16 protein concentrations as determined by ELISA. In contrast sera and IgG from 12 of 13 individuals without known thyroid disease failed to increase the production of lymphocyte chemoattraction activity in fibroblasts or detectable IL 16 protein. Briefly culture wells with confluent Graves disease fibroblast monolayers were treated for 24 h with GD IgG the media were collected and subjected to the T cell chemotaxis assay or to the IL 16 ELISA both as described above. All samples were assayed in triplicate. IL 16 dependent migration represents the difference between T cell chemotaxis in the presence and absence of neutralizing antibodies. The data were subjected to linear regression analysis using the equation f x 0.1256108 15.37059. r 0.914 p 0.001 . IgG preparations from 2 individuals with active rheumatoid arthritis and 2 individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus failed to induce IL 16 in fibroblasts from individuals with Graves disease. These results demonstrate the specificity with regard to the type of autoimmune disease affecting the donor of IgG.

GD IgG might be ligating the TSHR and through that potential interaction initiating the events culminating in the induction of IL 16. The receptor is expressed on fibroblasts from several anatomic regions and is competent to signal through p70 Bell et al. 279 C335 2000 . Consequently Graves disease fibroblasts were incubated with high concentrations of rTSH up to 10 mU ml and it was determined that the hormone fails to induce T cell chemoattractant activity or detectable IL 16 protein synthesis by Graves disease fibroblasts. As shown in the right panel of no correlation exists between GD IgG provoked T cell migration activity IL 16 dependent plus IL 16 independent from immunoglobulin treated fibroblasts and respective concentrations of anti TSHR antibodies TRAb . Briefly aliquots of sera from 26 different donors with Graves disease were subjected to IgG preparation with protein A and were subjected to T cell migration assays ordinate or were subjected to a radio receptor assay for TRAb as indicated along the abscissa. r 0.065 p 0.62 . The radio receptor assay kit DYNOtest TRAK for determining TSHR antibodies was purchased from Brahms Hennigsdorf Germany and used according to the manufacturer s instructions. These findings suggest strongly that the T cell chemotaxis and IL 16 inductions provoked by GD IgG are not related to the anti TSHR activity present in Graves disease sera and that the TSHR is not mediating the up regulation by GD IgG of IL 16.

A panel of 11 different fibroblast strains from individuals with Graves disease and 5 from individuals without known thyroid disease were challenged with GD IgG 100 ng ml normal IgG 100 ng ml or IL 1 10 ng ml BioSource Camarillo Calif. for 24 h and assessed for T cell migration activity via a lymphocyte chemotaxis assay and IL 16 production . The normal and GD IgGs used in that survey each derived from either of 2 individual donors. These were not pooled. GD IgG induced IL 16 dependent cell migration in 10 of the Graves disease fibroblast strains that included those from the orbit or various anatomic regions of skin. Included were strains from the pretibial skin as well as the abdominal wall and the neck. The latter two sites rarely manifest Graves disease. A substantial fraction of the GD IgG provoked T cell migration activity in most of these strains was resistant to neutralization with anti IL 16.

To determine whether neutralizing antibodies directed at other chemoattractant molecules could block the residual activity the effect of anti RANTES on GD IgG provoked T cell migration activity was investigated . GD IgG up regulated both IL 16 and RANTES proteins in eight Graves disease derived fibroblast strains while RANTES was undetectable in two of the Graves disease strains exhibiting marked IL 16 inductions. GD IgG failed to up regulate T cell chemotaxis or to induce either IL 16 or RANTES protein in one Graves disease strain orbital strain 9 and in any of the 5 culture strains derived from donors without known thyroid disease. The control IgG failed to induce either IL 16 or RANTES expression in any of the fibroblast strains tested. In contrast IL 1 induced T cell chemoattraction in all fibroblast strains consistent with Sciaky et al. supra 2000.

This example demonstrates that Rheumatoid Arthritis IgGs RA IgGs and GD IgGs each induce a chemotactic response and chemokine expression in fibroblasts obtained from individuals afflicted with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Graves Disease respectively and that this induction is mediated through IGF 1R.

To determine whether T cell chemotaxis induced by RA IgGs and GD IgGs in fibroblasts obtained from individuals afflicted with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Graves Disease respectively the presence of an anti IGF 1R blocking antibody on T cell chemotaxis was observed utilizing the IGF 1R blocking antibody 36491 Pharmingen San Diego Calif. . As shown in the induction of chemotaxis by disease specific IgGs can be mimicked by adding IGF 1 and further can be attenuated by adding IGF 1R.

To determine whether IGF 1R could be directly implicated in the mediation of GD IgG dependent and RA IgG dependent respectively increases in IL 16 and RANTES expression cultures were challenged with the respective Igs in the absence or presence of the anti IGF 1R blocking antibody which binds the receptor subunit. As shown in presence of the anti IGF 1R blocking antibody results in the attenuation of the responses to disease specific IgGs in both Graves Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Thus the blockade of IGF 1R is associated with a near complete attenuation of these two disease specific IgG provoked responses.

This example demonstrates that GD IgG can provoke release of newly synthesized IL 16 from Graves disease fibroblasts in a caspase 3 dependent manner.

To determine whether GD IgG induces the de novo synthesis of IL 16 in Graves disease fibroblasts confluent fibroblast monolayers in this case from the skin were treated with GD IgG 100 ng ml for the durations indicated along the abscissa of . The confluent fibroblast monolayers were pulse labeled with 35S methionine 500 Ci ml for 6 h and immunoprecipitated with anti IL 16 clone 14.1 5 g ml conjugated to protein A beads washed and counted for radioactivity. The data shown in are expressed as the mean SD of three replicates. S IL 16 release was enhanced within 12 h of IgG addition to the culture medium. The maximal synthesis occurred by 30 h when it was at least 100 fold above baseline and was sustained for the duration of the study 48 h . IL 16 protein is synthesized as a pro molecule of 69 kDa that undergoes modification to the 56 kDa active molecule which is released from the cell Baier et al. 94 5273 1997 Zhang et al. 273 1144 1998 . In lymphocytes this processing involves a caspase 3 dependent cleavage Zhang et al. supra 1998 . Moreover in fibroblasts the induction by IL 1 of IL 16 involves this enzyme Sciaky et al. supra 2000 .

In order to determine whether inhibition of caspase 3 with a specific inhibitory peptide could block the GD IgG release of IL 16 in Graves disease fibroblasts the peptide designated Ac DEVD CHO a caspase 3 specific inhibitor was added to fibroblasts. In particular confluent fibroblast monolayers were treated with GD IgG 100 ng ml alone or in combination with the caspase 3 inhibitory peptide Ac DEVD CHO 100 M or a caspase 1 inhibitory peptide Ac YVAD Ald 100 M . Media were collected and subjected to either the T cell migration assay Top panel or an IL 16 ELISA Bottom panel . Migration was determined in the absence or presence of anti IL 16 5 g ml or anti RANTES 5 g ml antibodies. Data are expressed as the mean SD of triplicate determinations. As shown in addition of the peptide designated Ac DEVD CHO to fibroblast medium resulted in a dramatic decrease in the lymphocyte migration ascribable to IL 16 and to the induction by IgG of IL 16 protein as determined in the ELISA assay. In contrast the up regulation of RANTES was unaffected. The caspase 1 specific peptide inhibitor Ac YVAD Ald failed to influence either IL 16 or RANTES activity or protein release into the medium.

In order to determine whether GD IgG induces chemoattractant expression in GD fibroblasts by acting as a growth factor and binding an epitope on the surface of the fibroblast and initiating protein synthesis through the activation of one or more signaling pathways the possibility of involvement of FRAP mTOR pathway was investigated. The FRAP mTOR pathway and the activation of the serine threonine kinase p70play central roles in mediating the effects provoked by multiple factors acting at the cell surface Pullen and Thomas 410 78 1997 . A prominent characteristic of this pathway is its susceptibility to inhibition by the macrolide rapamycin Brennan et al. 19 4729 1999 . Significantly rapamycin at a concentration of 20 nM can block ca 50 of the chemoattractive activity elicited by GD IgG coinciding with an attenuation of IL 16 dependent T cell migration . The induction of IL 16 protein by GD IgG is blocked by rapamycin whereas that of RANTES is not.

To determine whether GD IgG increased levels of activated p70 western blot immunoblot analysis with a primary antibody specific for p70phosphorylated at Thr. Briefly p70S6k activation was assessed by subjecting cellular protein from IgG activated fibroblasts to immunoblot analysis. Fibroblasts were allowed to proliferate to confluence in 60 mm plates. Following incubations with the test compounds indicated monolayers were solubilized in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 1 mM EDTA 100 mM NaCl 0.5 deoxycholate 1 Triton X 100 10 glycerol 0.1 SDS 2 mM Na3VO4 20 mM NaP2O4 1 mM NaF and 1 mM microcystin 10 g ml aprotinin and 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysate samples normalized to their respective protein content were boiled in Laemmli buffer and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method described by Wang et al. 271 22718 1996 . The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes Bio Rad and subsequently incubated with primary phospho specific anti p70Thr 389 Cell Signaling Technology . Other aliquots of the sample were electrophoresed and blotted against a pan p70antibody Santa Cruz or anti actin antibody Sigma . Following extensive washes at room temperature the membranes were incubated with secondary peroxidase labeled antibodies for 1 hour. Following washes the ECL Amersham Corp. chemiluminescence detection system was used to generate the relevant signals. The bands were analyzed densitometrically with a scanner.

For the results shown in confluent monolayers of orbital fibroblasts from two individuals with Graves disease A and B or a single donor with normal orbital tissue C were incubated with nothing control normal IgG 100 ng ml GD IgG 100 ng ml or IL 1 10 ng ml for 15 min cells were rinsed and harvested in lysis buffer. Equivalent amounts of protein were subjected to western blot analysis as described above with pan anti p70 phospho specific anti p70Thr389 or anti actin antibodies. Column heights represent p70Thr389 signal densities corrected for their respective actin levels. As shown in GD IgG elicits an increase in activated p70. IgG from control subjects also increased phosphorylated p70 but the levels were considerably lower than those for GD IgG. Moreover normal fibroblasts challenged with either GD IgG or control IgG failed to exhibit substantial p70activation. Taken together these findings demonstrate that p70activation by IgG may alone be insufficient to up regulate IL 16 expression. Given the ability of rapamycin to block the activation of p70is essential for the induction by GD IgG of IL 16 in fibroblasts.

Glucocorticoids exert powerful modulatory actions on the expression of many pro inflammatory molecules and they have an important therapeutic role in Graves disease complicated with TAO. The impact of these steroids on the induction by GD IgG of chemoattractant expression in fibroblasts was determined by adding glucocorticoid Dexamethasone 10 nM to the medium in combination with GD IgG and fibroblasts followed by a 16 h incubation. As shown in the glucocorticoid could block both IL 16 and RANTES induction by GD IgG.

This example demonstrates that the IGF 1R is directly involved in the activities exerted by GD IgG in fibroblasts derived from Graves disease individuals.

Fibroblasts activated by pro inflammatory cytokines express substantial T cell chemotaxis promoting activity Skiaky et al. supra 2000 . Moreover as described herein GD IgG isolated from individuals without or with overt TAO can activate fibroblasts from individuals with Graves disease to express high levels of IL 16 and RANTES.

Serum from individuals with Graves disease contains anti TSHR antibodies. In order to determine whether TSHR represents the self antigen relevant to these effects in fibroblasts Graves disease fibroblasts were treated with TSH 2 mU mi for 24 h and were then assayed for chemoattractant expression.

As shown in TSH failed to influence either IL 16 or RANTES expression. This result demonstrates that TSHR activation is not mediating the actions of GD IgG on fibroblasts. IL 1 induces both IL 16 and RANTES levels and T cell chemotaxis in all fibroblast strains tested regardless of whether they were derived from individuals with Graves disease or from control subjects without known thyroid disease.

A large number of other compounds known to bind and activate receptors expressed by human fibroblasts were examined for their ability to induce IL 16 and RANTES since their respective receptors would then represent candidate antigens for GD IgG. Among those tested IGF 1 10 nM dramatically increased IL 16 and RANTES dependent T cell migration and the levels of both chemoattractants after a 24 h treatment of fibroblast cultures . The magnitude of the inductions was similar to that observed with IL 1 .

To define the specificity of the IGF 1 effect the IGF 1R specific ligands Des 1 3 IGF 1 and Leu24 IGF 1 were also tested and found to induce chemoattractant expression. shows induction of IL 16 protein and RANTES protein by GD IgGs and the IGF analog des 1 3 a truncated form of IGF 1 that lacks the N terminal tripeptide and is a IGF 1R specific ligand with much reduced affinity for IGF binding proteins IGFBP compared to natural IGF 1 as described by Bang et al. 124 620 629 1991 which is incorporated herein by reference. Leu24 IGF 1 is an analog of human IGF 1 with the substitution of a Leu for a Tyr at position 24. Leu24 IGF 1 has a strongly reduced affinity for the IGF 1R and a reduced affinity for some IGFBP. As shown in panel B of T cell chemotactic activity in Graves disease fibroblasts is attributable to GD IgGs and signaled through the IGF 1R per se rather than through accessory binding proteins IGFBP .

To test whether IGF 1 activities are similarly restricted several different fibroblast strains obtained from normal donors were tested. As shown in none of these fibroblasts responded to IGF 1 treatment under identical conditions to those used in studies with Graves disease fibroblasts. Thus intrinsic differences in Graves disease and normal fibroblasts underlie the responses to GD IgG and exogenous IGF 1 showing that IGF 1 and GD IgG act through the same or a related pathway. IL 1 induces both IL 16 and RANTES levels and T cell chemotaxis in all fibroblast strains tested regardless of whether they were derived from individuals with GD or from control subjects without known thyroid disease.

A large number of other compounds known to bind and activate receptors expressed by human fibroblasts were examined for their ability to induce IL 16 and RANTES since their respective receptors would then represent candidate antigens for GD IgG. Among those tested IGF 1 10 nM dramatically increased IL 16 and RANTES dependent T cell migration and the levels of both chemoattractants after a 24 h treatment of fibroblast cultures. The magnitude of the inductions was similar to that observed with IL 1.

To determine whether IGF 1R participates directly in the mediation of GD IgG dependent increases in IL 16 and RANTES expression cultures were challenged with Igs in the absence or presence of a highly specific receptor blocking antibody clone 1H7 which binds the receptor subunit. As shown in low concentrations of the antibody block the action of GD Ig. The concentrations of 1H7 tested ranged from 0.1 g ml to 5 g ml. Even at the lowest concentration used the attenuation of the responses to GD IgGs was 90 . Thus the blockade of IGF 1R is associated with a near complete attenuation of the GD IgG provoked responses.

To determine whether the impact of Graves disease serum on IGF 1R mediated chemoattractant expression could be generalized to the sera of most individuals with the disease several samples were tested on a single strain of Graves disease fibroblasts. As demonstrates all five sera samples provoked inductions of IL 16 and RANTES dependent T cell chemotaxis and in all cases anti IGF 1R antibodies blocked these inductions. Moreover the IgGs up regulated the levels of the two proteins as assessed by the cytokine specific ELISAs.

Another more direct approach to demonstrating the role of IGF 1R in mediating the GD IgG effects on chemotaxis produced by fibroblasts would involve targeting the receptor with a dominant negative DN mutant and interrupting its expression. Cultures were transiently transfected with the mutant IGF 1R 486 STOP or the empty vector as a control and determining the impact the DN has on cellular responses to GD IgG. Briefly cultures were allowed to proliferate to 80 confluence in medium containing 10 FBS. The plasmid containing 486 STOP DN IGF 1R was transiently transfected into the cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS system Invitrogen San Diego Calif. . In particular 0.75 g of the plasmid and 0.1 g of pRL TK vector DNA Promega serving as a transfection efficiency control were mixed with PLUS reagent for 15 minutes before being combined with LipofectAMINE PLUS for another 15 minutes. Some cultures received empty vector DNA as a control. The DNA lipid mixture was added to the culture medium for 3 h at 37 C. Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium containing 10 FBS replaced the transfection mixture overnight. Transfected cultures were then serum starved and some received GD IgG or normal IgG for 16 h. Media samples were collected and frozen until they were assayed for T cell migration promoting activity or for IL 16 and RANTES content in the respective ELISAs.

As shown in IFF 1R DN inhibited induction by GD IgG of T cell chemotactic activity and attenuated the induction of both IL 16 and RANTES by GD IgG. In contrast sham transfections and those with empty vector failed to alter the effects of GD IgG. Taken together with the results with the IGF 1R blocking antibodies and the IGF 1R specific agonists described above this result confirms that the IGF 1R receptor appears to be directly involved in the activities exerted by GD IgG in fibroblasts derived from Graves disease individuals.

This example shows that induction of IL 16 in Graves disease fibroblasts does not involve increases in IL 16 mRNA and that induction of RANTES in these cells is mediated at the pre translational level.

GD IgG induction of IL 16 and RANTES in fibroblasts involves divergent signaling pathways. As described herein the former up regulation is susceptible to rapamycin an inhibitor of the FRAP mTOR p70pathway whereas the latter is unaffected by the drug. Fibroblasts are known to express high levels of IL 16 mRNA constitutively and the levels are not affected by treatment with pro inflammatory cytokines that up regulate IL 16 protein synthesis and T cell chemotaxis attributed to it. As shown in the northern blot in GD IgG fails to increase the high levels of IL 16 mRNA over the course of the experiment up to 16 h . IL 1 also failed to influence steady state transcript levels. In contrast RANTES mRNA is not detected under basal culture conditions but there occurs a substantial and time dependent induction of the transcript with IgG treatment. There also occurred a strong induction in cultures treated with IL 1 .

For the Northern analysis fibroblasts were cultivated in 100 mm diameter plates to a confluent state and were then treated with the test agents. Briefly cellular RNA was extracted from rinsed monolayers by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi 162 156 159 1987 with an RNA isolating system purchased from Biotecx Houston Tex. . The nucleic acid was subjected to electrophoresis through denaturing 1 agarose formaldehyde gels. Integrity of the RNA was established by determining the 260 280 spectroscopic ratios and by staining the electrophoresed samples with ethidium bromide and inspecting them under UV light. The RNA was transferred to Zeta probe membrane Bio Rad and immobilized samples were hybridized with P dCTP labeled PGHS 1 PGHS 2 p23 and mPGES cDNA probes generated by the random primer method. Hybridization was conducted in a solution containing 5 SSC 50 formamide 5 Denhardt s solution 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5 1 SDS and 0.25 mg ml salmon sperm at 48 C. overnight. Membranes were washed under high stringency conditions and then the RNA DNA hybrids were visualized by autoradiography on X Omat film Kodak Rochester N.Y. following exposure at 70 C. Bands resulting from radioactive hybrids were scanned by densitometry. Membranes were then stripped according to the instructions of the manufacturer and rehybridized with a GAPDH cDNA probe and the band densities were normalized to this signal.

The cell surface display of IGF 1R by PBMCs was investigated. As with fibroblasts donors with GD exhibit a larger fraction of peripheral blood T cells CD3 IGF 1R expressing IGF 1R compared to controls.

Subjects aged 20 65 were recruited from the individual population of Jules Stein Eye Institute and Harbor UCLA Medical Center. Informed consent was obtained as approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Center for Health Sciences at UCLA and Harbor UCLA Medical Center. The study population comprised individuals evaluated for GD all of whom manifested either stable or active TAO. Control subjects were healthy volunteers without known GD or other autoimmune disease who presented for aesthetic or functional eyelid surgery. Individuals excluded from the study included those with non thyroid autoimmune disease asthma granulomatous disease sinusitis or HIV infection. Individuals with GD comprised a clinically heterogeneous group and included those who were hyperthyroid n 3 and euthyroid n 30 . A minority of individuals had active inflammatory disease Clinical Activity Score 3 n 8 while most exhibited stable TAO CAS

No association between IGF 1R display and disease duration or degree of orbital inflammation could be demonstrated. Bone marrow samples were derived from a individual with stable GD a healthy volunteer or at necropsy within 24 hours of death. Orbital tissue was obtained from surgical waste during orbital decompression surgery in individuals with GD or from healthy individuals during cosmetic surgery. The tissue was transported on ice homogenized and single cell suspensions prepared. Tissue was filtered using a 70 m filter and processed for flow cytometry.

Clinical data including age sex medications smoking history physical exam and laboratory values were recorded. Careful examination of the skin failed to detect evidence of thyroid related dermopathy in any of the study participants.

For flow cytometry peripheral blood approx. 5 ml was obtained and stored in tubes containing EDTA. Staining buffer SB was prepared in phosphate buffered saline containing 4 FBS with 0.1 sodium azide Sigma Aldrich . Staining for flow cytometry was performed within 24 h of blood collection according to the manufacturer s instructions BD Biosciences San Jose . Briefly 100 l whole blood or bone marrow aspirate was placed in 12 75 mm polypropylene tubes and fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies were added 1 g 106 cells . These were then incubated in the dark for 20 min at room temperature. FACSlyse solution 2 ml was added for 10 min at room temperature to disrupt RBCs. Cells were washed twice with SB re suspended in Cytofix BD Biosciences and kept in the dark at 4 C. until cytometric analysis within 24 h . Analysis was performed on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer BD Biosciences . Mean fluorescent intensity M.F.I. was calculated as a ratio of mean fluorescence sample isotype fluorescence. Percent positive expression was defined as the fraction of cells with increased fluorescent intensity compared to an isotype control.

PBMCs were prepared using a technique described previously 35 . Briefly whole blood was diluted 1 2 in PBS and layered over Ficoll Hypaque centrifuged at 500 g for 25 min and washed 3 times in PBS. 3 10cells ml were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with PHA 2 g ml or in plates coated with anti CD3 BD Biosciences or anti T cell receptor BD Biosciences antibodies 10 g ml . Purified CD3 T cells were negatively selected using magnetic cell sorting BD IMag according to the manufacturer s instructions BD Biosciences . For T cell preparation PBMCs were incubated in a cocktail of biotinylated antibodies not binding T lymphocytes BD Biosciences . Streptavidin particles were added to the cell suspension and T cells collected following magnetic depletion. They were enriched to greater than 97 purity without activation by analysis of CD69 and CD25 before and after enrichment.

Ficoll Hypaque was purchased from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. . FacLyse buffer Cytofix anti CD3 CyChrome anti IGF 1R PE clone 1H7 anti CD45RA APC and anti CD45RO APC and isotype mouse IgG1 FITC PE APC and CyChrome were purchased from BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. . Fetal bovine serum FBS was obtained from Life Technologies Grand Island N.Y. . IGF 1 and Des1 3 IGF 1 were supplied by Calbiochem San Diego Calif. and Gro Pep Adelaide Australia respectively.

The phenotypic profile of T cells derived from the orbital tissue of individuals with TAO mirrors that in the peripheral circulation and exhibits a disproportionately large fraction of IGF 1R T cells. Orbital and peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from the same donors. A relatively small percentage of both CD4 T cells and total T cells are IGF 1R in the peripheral blood of control donors 29 and 28 respectively . A similarly small fraction of T cells express IGF 1R in orbital tissue from these same donors CD4 23 total CD3 26 . In contrast orbital T cells from a individual with TAO are over represented by the IGF 1R phenotype CD4 51 CD3 56 and thus resemble those in the peripheral blood CD4 64 CD3 61 .

It was subsequently determined that the relative abundance of IGF 1R bone marrow T cells appears substantially greater than that found in the peripheral circulation of both control donors and those with GD. As demonstrated in marrow derived T cells CD3 CD19 CD45 CD15 CD14 from two control donors and a individual with GD uniformly express IGF 1R. The expected increased fraction in peripheral blood IGF 1R T cells is found in GD inset .

The fraction of CD45RA IGF 1R T lymphocytes from individuals and control donors appears similar . In contrast CD3 CD45RO IGF 1R cells account for a small fraction of T cells from control donors 8 4 n 5 but a substantially greater proportion of those from individuals 57 12 n 5 p

To determine whether IGF 1R display on T cells from individuals with GD is durable in culture and can be up regulated by CD3 activation peripheral blood T cells from those individuals and control donors were isolated and placed in culture without or with anti CD3 Ab 10 g ml . As expected an increased fraction of GD derived T cells expressed IGF 1R 68 compared to controls 25 immediately following isolation. These levels remained constant for 72 h in culture without stimulation. Addition of anti CD3 Ab expanded IGF 1R T cells after 72 h in cultures from both sources. In each experiment n 5 fewer IGF 1R T cells un stimulated and anti CD3 stimulated were found in control donor cultures than those from individuals with GD CD3 stimulated GD T cells 84 6 control T cells 57 5 p

IGF 1R activation has been shown previously to enhance normal T cell proliferation and confer resistance to apoptosis Tu et al. 165 1331 1336 2000 Walsh and O Connor 30 1010 1018 2000 . To determine whether the increased fraction of circulating IGF 1R T cells found in GD conveys a functionally different phenotype PBMCs were stimulated with plate immobilized anti CD3 10 g ml in the absence or presence of IGF 1 10 nM . IGF 1 significantly enhances T cell proliferation compared to cells receiving anti CD3 Ab alone for 48 h . Moreover Des 1 3 IGF 1 10 nM an analogue that binds and selectively activates IGF 1R 5 also enhances the mitogenic effects of anti CD3 Ab. In contrast PBMCs from control donors failed to respond to IGF 1 or Des 1 3 IGF 1 as measured by BrdU incorporation p

As expected IGF 1 failed to influence cell proliferation in the absence of anti CD3 Ab data not shown . GD IgG also binds IGF 1R and initiates signaling in fibroblasts from donors with GD Pritchard et al. 168 942 950 2002 . Here it promotes proliferation of GD derived T cells but fails to influence control cells . As data in that figure demonstrate purified T cells 97 stimulated with either PHA or immobilized TCR data not shown responded to IGF 1 similarly.

IGF 1 inhibits T cell apoptosis provoked by either anti Fas or anti CD3 Abs . Cells were stained with annexin V FITC and 7 AAD BD Pharmingen according to the manufacturer s directions and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell debris was excluded from analysis by adjusting the forward light scatter threshold. Cells staining positively with annexin V FITC but excluding 7 AAD were regarded as those undergoing apoptosis. The fraction of early apoptotic T cells following addition of either Ab was similar in cultures from GD and control individuals 17.2 and 16.2 respectively . Addition of IGF 1 reduced the T cell apoptosis to 6.8 in cultures from individuals compared to 15.5 in controls. Similarly addition of IGF 1 significantly inhibited Fas induced apoptosis in T cells from GD individuals but not in controls . Thus it would appear that IGF 1 exerts both mitogenic and anti apoptotic actions in peripheral circulating T cells derived from individuals with GD.
