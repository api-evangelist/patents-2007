title: Method and system for providing a bi-directional feedback loop between project management and personal calendar systems
abstract: A system providing a bi-directional feedback loop that assists project management to make timely decisions and alterations based on personal calendar data retrieved from team members' calendars. The system provides a project manager user with perceptible alerts in a project manager user interface in response to detecting a conflict between proposed or actual personal calendar events of a team member user and deliverables assigned to that team member user. The project manager user interface enables the project manager to take an action in the event such a conflict is detected. Project manager actions in this regard may include permitting a conflicting personal calendar event, forbidding the conflicting personal calendar event, delegating the conflicting deliverable to another team member, adjusting the deliverable requirements, and/or escalating the conflict to a higher level of management.

The present invention relates generally to computer applications for calendaring and project management and more specifically to a method and system for providing a bi directional feedback loop between project management and personal schedules.

As it is generally known popular computer application programs today include those referred to as electronic calendars that enable users to keep track of calendar events. These systems enable users to enter and view their daily schedules through a graphical user interface. User activities can be entered and subsequently viewed as calendar activities such as meetings vacations phone calls etc. Typical electronic calendars enable a user to set up to alerts that are generated at a certain time and or at recurring times. Some existing calendaring systems can be used to provide alert messages to groups of users and to allow users to view each other s calendars. Group scheduling functions are also sometimes provided allowing a user to set up meetings with other users. Meeting invitation messages may also be provided conveyed for example by way of electronic mail e mail messages and responses to such invitations may be collected and processed.

Project management applications are another type of existing computer application program. Project management applications are used to monitor the resources such as time and materials needed for and or allocated to a project. In existing project management applications tasks to be completed during a project are entered into a database the project management system determines dependencies between the tasks and may further determine a critical path consisting of the series of tasks with the least amount of slack time.

Problems with existing systems relate to the lack of effective two way integration between calendaring and project management applications. Specifically existing systems lack an effective mechanism that associates time allocations in personal calendars with project requirements. Existing systems fail to effectively highlight issues caused by changes in personal electronic calendars of team members through a relevant project management user interface view. Existing systems also do not allow a project manager to conveniently take meaningful actions with regard to changes in the personal electronic calendars of team members even when such changes have an impact on a project schedule. For example existing systems do not provide a project manager with any mechanism allowing him to take actions such as approve disapprove auto adjust schedule etc. with regard to personal electronic calendars of team members in order to prevent non project activities from having an impact on a project schedule. Existing systems accordingly also cannot convey any reason information regarding actions taken by a project manager with regard to team members individual electronic calendars for example to indicate why the project manager took a given action.

Some existing calendaring and scheduling applications such as IBM s Lotus Notes and Microsoft Outlook handle personal meetings and appointments so that they are easy for an individual user to manage. Existing project management PM tools such as Microsoft Project handle tasks for many users to make managing a project plan easy everything runs on schedule. In addition some software downloads from Microsoft allow exporting certain information from Microsoft Project to an Outlook calendar. While these downloads can be somewhat helpful they are significantly limited in their effectiveness and do not support using a team member s electronic calendar information to help flag problems and or drive a project plan. Such existing systems further do not help a project manager conveniently adjust task assignments in a project plan as team members schedules as become overloaded.

To address the above described and other shortcomings of previous approaches a new method and system for providing a bi directional feedback loop between project management and personal schedules are disclosed. The disclosed system accommodates the fact that during the normal life cycle of a project team members will participate in collaborative aspects of the project including meetings and e mail conversations and that other activities that further progress of the project. However the disclosed system recognizes that potential schedule delays can be detected in circumstances indicating a conflict between a team member s personal calendar and a project schedule. For example if too many non project activities e.g. meetings are on a team member s personal schedule this can be detected by the disclosed system and an indication provided to their project leader that the team member appears to be too overloaded to complete one or more of their project deliverables e.g. writing a design document required as part of a project plan.

The disclosed system provides a bi directional feedback loop that assists project management in making timely decisions and alterations based on accurate personal calendar data retrieved from individual team members calendars. The disclosed system provides a project manager user with a perceptible alert in a project manager user interface in response to detecting an apparent conflict between proposed or actual personal calendar activities of a team member user and one or more project deliverables i.e. tasks assigned to that team member user. The project manager user interface further enables the project manager to take an action in the event such a conflict is detected. Project manager actions in this regard may for example include permitting a conflicting calendar activity forbidding the conflicting calendar activity delegating the conflicting task to another team member adjusting the task requirements and or escalating the conflict to a higher level of management e.g. through an e mail message or the like . The results of such project manager actions are conveyed into the personal electronic calendar information of the impacted team member s and visual indications of such project manager actions may be provided through the personal electronic calendar user interfaces of such team member s . Similarly project manager actions may alternatively or additionally result in out of band messages e.g. e mail or other messages being sent to the impacted team member s notifying the team members of the specific action s taken by the project manager.

The disclosed system conveniently allows a project manager to adjust tasks placed on team members personal electronic calendars through an interactive process. Timely warnings to the project manager of team member overbooking allows for early schedule alterations instead of late in schedule surprises. The disclosed system enables project managers to receive early warnings of schedule slippage due to individual team members personal schedules. Project managers can then select from and initiate multiple options including commenting on conflicting calendar activities reassigning task responsibility forbidding conflicting calendar activities and others enabling them to reduce individual participation in non critical path activities e.g. meetings in order to keep team members on the path of meeting project deadlines.

The calendaring application server logic is shown communicably coupled to a number of team member client computer systems and the project management application server logic is shown communicably coupled to at least one project manager client system . For example the calendaring application server logic communicates with client application logic in a team member client system and with client application logic in a team member client system . The client application logic generates an electronic calendar user interface for team member user B while client application logic generates an electronic calendar user interface for a team member user A . The team member client system and team member client system may for example be made up of client computer systems such as desktop laptop or other specific type of client computer system and or other specific types of electronic devices capable of providing graphical user interfaces including the electronic calendar user interfaces and such as personal data assistants PDAs cell phones etc. The client application logic and may be made up of any specific type of client logic such as program code executing on the team member client systems and hardware circuitry contained in the client systems and and or some combination of such program code and hardware circuitry. For example the client application logic and may include or be part of Web browser application programs or the like executing on the team member client systems and .

Further in the example of the project management application server logic communicates with client application logic in project manager client system . The client application logic generates a project management user interface for project manager user . The project manager client system may for example be a client computer system such as a desktop laptop or other type of client computer system and or other specific type of electronic device including a graphical user interface operable to present the generated project management user interface to the project manager user such as a personal data assistant PDAs cell phones etc. The client application logic may be made up of any specific type of client logic such as program code executing on the project manager client system hardware circuitry contained in the project manager client system and or some combination of such program code and hardware circuitry. For example the client application logic may include or be part of Web browser application programs or the like executing on the project manager client system .

During operation of the components shown in a bi directional feedback loop is provided between the calendaring application server logic and project management application server logic as further described below.

The disclosed system may be embodied in various specific ways to provide the bi directional feedback loop of . illustrate three of many possible embodiments in this regard.

Upon detection of the events the project management application server logic causes a project manager e.g. the project manager user of to be notified that a team member has scheduled an amount of activities in their electronic calendar that appears to conflict with their project task assignments. Such a notification may for example be provided through a user interface associated with the project management application e.g. the project management user interface shown in .

As noted above the calendaring application server logic and project management application server logic are provided with two way communication which may be previously established or may be established at step . Examples of how the disclosed system may provide such two way communication are shown in but the disclosed system is not limited to those specific embodiments.

In one embodiment at step the calendar server notifies the project management server of each change in the personal calendars of group members that may have impact on any of the project plans entered at step . Such events may for example include the scheduling of vacation days meetings or other work activities not associated with a project etc. illustrates how such events may be passed from the calendaring application server logic to the project management application logic .

At step the project management server analyzes the events from the calendar server and assesses whether a calendar change likely impacts any project plan. For example events that might be provided from the calendar server indicating that a user has scheduled vacation days and or has scheduled meetings or other work activities not associated with a given project might cause the project management server to determine whether the total amount of time scheduled for such activities is likely to have an impact on a project schedule based on specific group member time allotments contained in one or more of the project plans entered at step .

The project management server determines at step one or more specific tasks that are put at risk by received calendar change events and highlights issues to the project manager by marking such tasks in a project management user interface e.g. project management user interface . For example the project management application server logic may operate at step to display one or more graphical representations of group member tasks in the project management user interface in a predetermined color e.g. red where the tasks in the project management user interface are each represented by graphical objects such as bars or lines arranged in a Gantt chart type configuration.

At step the project management user interface allows the project manager to select an action to be taken with regard to the potential conflict detected at step . For example a portion of the project management user interface may display a number of user selectable options to the project manager user where each of the displayed options is associated with an action regarding one or more calendar entries that have been determined to conflict with one or more tasks defined in the project plans entered at step . Such options may for example include approving of the conflicting calendar entry or entries and accordingly accepting the risk that a task may be impacted approving the conflicting calendar entry or entries and delegating the conflicting task to another group member user approving the conflicting calendar entry or entries and adjusting the conflicting portion of the project plan disapproving of the conflicting calendar entry or entries and or causing an escalation of the conflict to a higher level of management e.g. by causing an e mail message or the like to be sent to a higher level manager user .

In one embodiment at step the project manager user is allowed to provide a reason e.g. text explaining why a specific action was selected in step . At step based in the action selected by the project manager at step the project management server communicates with the calendar server e.g. generates one or more events that are propagated to the calendar server . For example such events might be events indicating the approval or disapproval of specific calendar entries and include any associated reason information entered by the project manager.

Upon receipt of the action information provided at step from the project management server at step the calendar server processes the specific actions indicated by that action information and annotates the affected dates and or times as displayed in the specific electronic calendar user interfaces of the affected team members. For example such annotations may include visual indications of disapproved calendar entries such as marking of disapproved calendar entries in a first pre determined color and or visual display format e.g. in red with a reason for the disapproval also displayed displaying approved calendar entries in a second pre determined color and or visual display format e.g. in green with a check mark displayed proximate to the entry etc. Any specific type of distinct colors or other visual indications may be used to indicate the specific actions taken by the project manager in response to detection of a schedule conflict. Moreover display of and or access to reason information in the electronic calendar user interfaces may be provided for any of actions that may be taken by the project manager in response to detection of a potential project schedule conflict detected by the disclosed system.
