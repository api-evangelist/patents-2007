The present invention relates to constructing declarative descriptions of stream processing requests and more particularly to a method for declarative semantic expression of user intent to enable goal driven stream processing.

Stream processing systems are information processing systems that operate on data at high input data rates. When under heavy load these systems generally do not have the resources to store all arriving data and thus must perform some amount of processing before storing a smaller subset of the incoming data and or presenting result data to end users. Generally stream processing systems execute stream processing applications that are an assembled collection of data components e.g. data sources and processing elements interconnected by communication channels e.g. streams . At run time the assembly of data processing components which together constitute a stream processing graph are deployed to one or more computers connected by a network. The data leaving one or more data sources is then sent to one or more components and the data produced by the components is sent to other components according to the configuration of the processing graph.

The stream processing system can produce a variety of different results depending on how components of the application are interconnected which components and which data sources are included in the processing graph and how the components of the processing graph are configured. Generally end users working with the system can easily describe their requirements on the outputs produced by the application but the same users do not have the expertise required to select the components and connect them such that the resulting stream processing application would produce the required results.

Recent advances in Semantic Web technologies have provided formal methods and standards for representing knowledge. Resource Description Framework RDF W3C Recommendation 10 Feb. 2004 a description of which can be found on the world wide web and more recently Web Ontology Language OWL are standards that are used for describing ontologies. OWL is an extension of RDF that in addition to basic RDF includes inferencing capabilities provided by reasoners for example a Description Logic DL reasoner.

The knowledge represented in RDF or OWL can be queried using SPARQL Query Language for RDF W3C Candidate Rec. which is a language for expressing queries against semantically described data e.g. data described using RDF graphs . SPARQL queries are stated by designating result variables and by describing using semantic graph patterns the characteristics of things e.g. RDF resources or OWL individuals that could be suitable values for the results. The descriptions are expressed as a graph comprised of RDF triples depicting the relationships connecting these variables with other variables of with other resources. If any subgraphs of the RDF graph are found to match the desired relationships the corresponding assignment of variables is included in the result set of the query with each assignment constituting a row in the result set.

Various stream processing architectures and systems exist or are being developed that provide a means of querying ephemeral streaming data. However most of these systems assume that the input streams contain structured data. In addition most of these systems focus on conventional relational operators and sliding window operators. Relational and time windowed analyses are necessary in a streaming environment. However stream processing applications may need to perform other kinds of operations in order to process the likely unstructured streaming data e.g. raw sensor data video or audio signals etc. into a meaningful response. Such operations include annotation classification transformation aggregation and filtering of specific kinds of data in the streams. While some of these operations are expressible in relational algebra expressing all of the needed stream processing functions would require a user with needed deep knowledge of both problem and solution domains and could result in extremely detailed possibly over constrained queries procedures that combine problem and solution descriptions.

Another challenge for stream processing systems lies in the construction of processing graphs that can satisfy user queries. With large numbers of disparate data sources and processing elements to choose from we cannot expect the end user to craft these graphs manually. The set of processing elements and data sources can also change dynamically as new sources are discovered or new processing elements are developed. Different end users express widely varying queries requiring a large number of different graphs to be constructed. Since there is an exponential number of possible graphs for a given number of data sources and processing elements it is not feasible to pre construct all the graphs manually to satisfy the wide variety of end user queries.

In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention a method for constructing a stream processing request so that a stream processing application satisfying the stream processing request can be assembled comprises inputting a stream processing request wherein the stream processing request includes a goal that is represented by a graph pattern that semantically describes a desired stream processing outcome and assembling a stream processing graph wherein the stream processing graph is assembled to include at least one processing element that satisfies the desired processing outcome by associating the graph pattern that semantically describes the desired processing outcome with a graph pattern that semantically describes an input of the at least one processing element and a graph pattern that semantically describes an output of the at least one processing element or to include at least one data source by associating the graph pattern that semantically describes the desired processing outcome with a graph pattern that semantically describes an output of the at least one data source.

The stream processing request is encoded in a request specification language. The request specification language is an inquiry specification language ISL .

The goal is a goal that requests production of data a goal that requests an update of retained state information a goal that requests installation of a processing element or a goal that requests removal of a processing element.

The method further comprises deploying a stream processing application embodying the at least one processing element or the at least one data source and operating the stream processing application.

Result data is produced when operating the stream processing application. The result data is an end result of the operated stream processing application or an intermediate result of the operated stream processing application wherein the intermediate result is an output of a data source or an output of a processing element.

When the goal is a goal that requests the production of data the result data includes an element that is a requested data item. The element is expressed as a variable. The element is defined in a where clause. The where clause explicitly references the variable. The where clause includes an assertion that constrains a type of data item acceptable as an element.

The assertion refers to a class description in an ontology description language. The ontology description language is a Resource Description Framework RDF or Web Ontology Language OWL .

When the goal is a goal that requests the production of data the stream processing request further includes a disposition that semantically describes a means of handling the result data. The disposition includes a condition expression that defines a condition under which the disposition is to occur. The condition expression is a Boolean expression. The disposition indicates that the result data is to be conveyed to a network destination the result data is to be retained for further processing the result is available for retrieval or the result data is to be conveyed to an external data store.

The stream processing request further includes a constraint that is represented by a graph pattern that semantically describes constraints on the assembly of the stream processing graph.

The constraint establishes a preference on the inclusion of a data source that is to feed data to the processing graph the inclusion of an algorithm or a processing element that is to be used in the processing graph or the interconnection of processing elements in the processing graph. The constraint is a hard constraint or a soft constraint.

In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention a system for constructing a declarative description of a stream processing requests so that a stream processing application satisfying the stream processing request can be assembled comprises a memory device for storing a program a processor in communication with the memory device the processor operative with the program to receive and compile a stream processing request wherein the stream processing request includes a goal that is represented by a graph pattern that semantically describes a desired stream processing outcome and assemble a stream processing graph that satisfies the desired processing outcome wherein the stream processing graph is assembled to include at least one processing element by associating the graph pattern that semantically describes the desired processing outcome with a graph pattern that semantically describes an input of the at least one processing element and a graph pattern that semantically describes an output of the at least one processing element or to include at least one data source by associating the graph pattern that semantically describes the desired processing outcome with a graph pattern that semantically describes an output of the at least one data source.

In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention a computer program product comprising a computer useable medium having computer program logic recorded thereon for constructing a declarative description of a stream processing requests so that a stream processing application satisfying the stream processing request can be assembled the computer program logic comprises program code for receiving and compiling a stream processing request wherein the stream processing request includes a goal that is represented by a graph pattern that semantically describes a desired stream processing outcome and program code for assembling a stream processing graph that satisfies the desired processing outcome wherein the stream processing graph is assembled to include at least one processing element by associating the graph pattern that semantically describes the desired processing outcome with a graph pattern that semantically describes an input of the at least one processing element and a graph pattern that semantically describes an output of the at least one processing element or to include at least one data source by associating the graph pattern that semantically describes the desired processing outcome with a graph pattern that semantically describes an output of the at least one data source.

The foregoing features are of representative embodiments and are presented to assist in understanding the invention. It should be understood that they are not intended to be considered limitations on the invention as defined by the claims or limitations on equivalents to the claims. Therefore this summary of features should not be considered dispositive in determining equivalents. Additional features of the invention will become apparent in the following description from the drawings and from the claims.

In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention a method for conveying a desired outcome of one or more stream processing applications using semantic descriptions of processing goals plus semantically described constraints on potential solutions is provided. The corresponding semantic descriptions when specified according to the method and interpreted in the presence of semantically described stream processing components are used by a planner compiler to automatically assemble an information processing application to fulfill the request.

In this embodiment semantic graph patterns are used to convey a user s goals and for constraining the means by which the outcomes are pursued constraining for example both the data sources that are or are not to be drawn upon and the processing methods that are or are not to be used. In this manner the goals and constraints prepared by the user do not convey in any direct way the mechanism by which the request is to be satisfied. This allows an automated stream processing application planner the freedom and flexibility to select from many alternative data sources and processing methods the ones that are best suited to request and best suited to the computational resources at the time of the request. In this way stream processing components not envisioned by the user can be applied potentially providing a higher quality result or a result consuming fewer computational resources or satisfying any of a number of desired processing characteristics than can be selected by the user.

It is to be understood that since the principal type of request for information processing actions is the production of information content the following description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention will focus on how the method is used to describe information production goals. However since other types of outcomes e.g. the modification of stored data or the initiation of a process are also in the realm of desired outcomes several other types of stream processing goals are envisioned for use with the present invention. Further since the set of all processing outcomes is never completely known the method provides a means of extending the set of defined outcomes as well as a means of extending the set of constraints that may be imposed on the solutions.

In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention a method for semantically describing stream processing components which can be dynamically added to a system embodying the present invention is provided. In accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention a method and system for processing all of these descriptions by using a planner compiler is provided. Here the planner compiler interprets the desired outcomes the descriptions of candidate data sources and processing methods and produces one or more stream processing applications believed to be responsive to the semantically expressed intent.

Since a processing graph will be referred to when describing exemplary embodiments of the present invention a description of a processing graph is now provided.

A processing request is a semantically expressed request for some processing to be performed in a stream processing system by a stream processing application. Typically this involves the observation and analysis of streaming data. Processing is performed on the fly on data from streaming data sources producing a desired effect for example the production of requested information.

A running stream processing application observes data on streams emanating from a number of streaming data sources. On rare occasions the data observed is exactly the data desired but most often some amount of processing is required to identify and or formulate the desired result. With structure prepared source data such as that found on a Really Simple Syndication RSS feed little or no data preparation is required before analytic processing can proceed. At the other extreme the streaming data might be unstructured requiring some amount of conditioning classification filtration etc. before analytic processing can proceed.

To accommodate this spectrum of processing needs processing is assumed to use multiple stream connectable software modules called processing elements. For a given request it is possible to configure a collection of data sources and processing elements into a processing graph see that can achieve the goal for the processing request.

A single request might draw from one or more data sources and may filter transform aggregate correlate etc. the data to provide the desired result. Consider for example a stock prediction model isolating the top thread in that draws upon a single Trades data stream and applies a Trade Analytics component and a Stock Price Predictor component to produce a single Stock Price Prediction. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction the application may analyze data from Trades TV News and Radio sources as shown in with the Stock Price Predictor component basing a prediction on feeds from each of the analytic chains each conveying some information about the company in question.

As can be gleaned for a given request any number of such graphs could be assembled each consuming possibly different amounts of computational resources and each producing some desired result at different levels of result quality. Manually assembling such a graph from a large library of components can be a daunting task. Preparing many such graphs in order to choose the top performers for given resource consumption levels is not practicable. Thus a means of automatically assembling such processing graphs given a machine interpretable specification of the request s goal and a collection of machine interpretable descriptions of the data sources and processing elements that could when properly assembled be used to produce the desired results was developed.

It is to be understood that all stream processing applications process streams of data. In most cases data streams are produced. Any streaming data observed by or produced by a stream processing application is potentially accessible as result data whether it be some intermediate result primarily intended as an input to another downstream component or a declared result produced in response to a stream processing request. Any described result data corresponds to a stream in the stream processing application that produces the data. However since stream processing requests may request outcomes other than information production it is conceivable that some stream processing applications will observe and process streaming data but not produce any streams that are of interest to the requestor.

A description of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be provided in the following order Specification of Processing Requests Modeling Components using Semantic Graph Transformations and Method and System for Automatic Composition of Stream Processing Applications.

Users convey to a system embodying the present invention their desired stream processing outcomes via processing requests. Processing requests are expressed via request specifications encoded in a request specification language. The request specification language is a machine interpretable encoding of the request. The specific encoding format is not important so long as the requisite elements are described and conveyed with enough formal machine interpretable descriptive content so that they can be interpreted by a request compiler planner. When feasible the compiler automatically assembles an application believed capable of achieving the processing outcome conveyed in the request specification.

A request specification is a declarative semantic expression of the desired effects of running a stream processing application and the constraints under which the application is assembled. Request specifications carry the least amount of description needed to convey intent without unnecessary detail of how the request is to be carried out. A request specification can be automatically transformed by a request compiler into an application that is represented as a processing graph.

Request specifications are built from semantic graph expressions which are to be evaluated according to a semantic model of the concepts from a domain or domains of interest. Users first create such semantic models using an ontology description language such as Web Ontology Language Description Logic OWL DL W3C Rec. 10 Feb. 2004 a copy of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety describing the concept classes in their domain of interest and potential required relationships between individuals elements in those concept classes. Based on one or more of these semantic models a user describing some stream processing outcome crafts a request goal as one more graph patterns expressed for example in SPARQL that define and convey the intent of their request along with additional constraints and or preferences on how their request is to be satisfied. These constraints are also described using graph patterns.

Request specifications are authored by a user or some user agent and convey at the very least an expression of the goals for the processing request for example the goal of producing a notification that a particular company s stock value is anticipated to change by an amount greater than 5 of its current value or non information production goals such as the goal of having a piece of software installed or having a particular device configured. The request specification may also contain constraints on how that goal is to be achieved for example to avoid the use of video surveillance cameras as data sources or to favor the use of K means clustering algorithms.

The goals along with the accompanying constraints are processed by a stream processing application compiler for example a specialized artificial intelligence AI planner that treats these constrained goal specifications as end effects deriving from them stream processing graphs which are stream processing applications capable of achieving the user s intended stream processing outcome.

For example consider a simple request to watch for factors that might anticipate a significant change in a company s stock price. The request might be expressed informally as watch for changes greater than 5 percent in the stock price of company Breakfast Foods Group ticker symbol BFG . 

The request BFG Stock Activity Prediction has one goal that is to produce one result with two result elements the variables PredictedStockPrice and PredictedPercentageChange.

The request is written with a domain ontology in mind as shown for example by a domain ontology fragment in and states that for a Breakfast Foods Company with Ticker symbol BFG the elements PredictedStockPrice and PredictedPercentageChange are part of a Prediction associated with the company.

Produce goals optionally describe result disposition specifications which are descriptions of what to do with the resulting data. Some result data is surfaced for further processing some retained for later reference some for export to external stores database DB knowledgebase KB . . . and some for external reference for example via notification.

Results can be dealt with in a number of ways according to a set of disposition instructions. For example to notify some interested person or their agent of the result to persist the result for some specified amount of time or to stream the result to some IP port on some remote host etc. Multiple dispositions can be expressed for each declared result and any disposition can be conditionally applied.

In the following produce goal the result is persisted for one month six months if the PredictedPercentageChange 5 percentage points and the inquirer will be notified via a default mechanism of any PredictedPercentageChange 5 percentage points.

Note that the request shown above neither specifies nor constrains the components to be used in the processing graph. This approach favors discovery of components for example individual algorithms or processing subgraphs in an attempt to avoid over constrained specifications. User designation of components is optional the absence of such designations enables the request compiler to identify sources and methods that users may not have been aware of or that may produce higher quality results than those produced by user specified sources and methods.

However a request specification can include constraints regarding various plan elements. Constraints convey a requestor s instructions to Prefer Avoid etc. specified plan elements such as Data Sources Methods etc. These expressions provide indirect guidance to the compiler as soft constraints on the assembly of processing graphs. Say for example a custom developed algorithm for interpreting stock ticker data is strongly preferred or the use of any surveillance video is to be avoided 

Constraints can be either hard e.g. absolute or soft e.g. preferences . Hard constraints specifically require or prohibit some element or property of the solution. Soft constraints provide less strict guidance as to the composition of the processing graph. The use of preferences rather than absolute designations allows for the discovery of better alternative solutions in the context of user preferences and is thus favored for this method. Using only soft constraints the request specification can guide choices a compiler might make requiring user knowledge only of the items to be constrained but not of how the processing graph is assembled. But because hard constraints are sometimes required the method also provides a means of expressing such constraints.

The ontology in this example defines a property of Company called hasStockPricePrediction with a range StockPricePrediction. This value of this property is not likely to be available from a data source. More likely a combination of components capable of producing such a result would be needed to establish that relation and populate the remainder of the price prediction submodel for example the hasPredictedStockPrice and the hasPercentChange properties.

While subtle this is a key element for operator extensibility. For example rather than enriching a language with function calls accessing user provided code modules request specifications declaratively express the goal or goals of analysis via concepts and relations in the ontologies. So rather than calling a function to perform a task request specifications describe a result that can be achieved by assembling a processing graph that can produce the result. Thus a goal specified declarative description is used rather than a function invoked in a query expression. Further instead of requiring the requestor to describe the operations needed to calculate a PredictedPercentChange some processing graph is automatically assembled to produce the result composed from the needed operators for example the data sources and software components that jointly surface the requested data.

Request specifications can be expressed and conveyed in a textual form as depicted in the BFG example above. Since request specifications are expected to be produced and consumed mostly by tools the predominant representation is expected to be an XML encoding conformant to an XML Schema W3C Rec. 28 Oct. 2004 a copy of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

For stream processing graph assembly to be automatable machine interpretable semantic descriptions of components functional characteristics are needed. Here the focus is on black box descriptions of each component providing semantic descriptions of the input requirements and output capabilities of each component and the output capabilities of each data source. Any machine interpretable description of a component s functional capabilities can be considered so long as there is a means by which those descriptions can be used by a planner compiler to create a suitable processing graph.

Inputs and outputs are modeled using semantic graph patterns. These graphs describe the objects conveyed between components and describe relationships with other specified objects. The graphs associated with a given component s inputs describe constraints that input data must satisfy in order for the component to work correctly. Hence the descriptions are used to determine which other components can provide input data to the component forming the basis for automated assembly of processing graphs.

These descriptions are represented using a semantic description technique for example OWL DL. Reasoning at an expressivity similar to DL reasoning is essential in the graph assembly process if any but the most trivial matching is to be pursued.

Semantic descriptions consist of processing component descriptions and descriptions of the data produced required by the components. Processing component descriptions are based on core concepts defined in the system ontologies and the data descriptions are based on sets of domain and shared ontologies. The system ontologies define concepts such as DataSource and SoftwareComponent and the relations produces requires and contains. Expressed below in RDF N3 format is an excerpt of an exemplary OWL representation 

From these basic building blocks specific Data Source Software Component Input and Output prototypes can be defined each describing specific Data Source Input Output and Software Component exemplars such as DataSource HubbleEarthImageSource  and SoftwareComponent ImagePatternRecognizer  and their respective inputs and outputs.

The contains relation for input and outputs provides the mechanism for associating to a component semantic description of data to be carried on its inputs and or outputs.

In HubbleEarthlmageSource  a DataSource produces an Output that contains HubbleEarthImage  an individual in the class InfraredImage 

The use of the double underscores   in  HubbleEarthImage  is a graphical shorthand indicating that Image  is also a Variable and an Exemplar represented above as being of type Variable and of type Exemplar both of which are special classes defined in the system ontology . The HubbleEarthImage  is an Exemplar that can take the value of an individual in the class InfraredImage and that has the appropriate captured By and image Of properties associated therewith. Note that Hubble and Earth do not really appear in the output instead they are semantic descriptions of the HubbleEarthImage  data which appears in the output. Hence the contains relation is a special relation that is only those data items that the output explicitly describes using the contains relation are actually contained in the output. The remainder of the objects Earth while not contained in the output form a rich semantic description of the objects contained in the output for example  HubbleEarthImage .

Software components are described as requiring some number of inputs and producing some number of outputs. An ImagePatternRecognizer processing component for example ImagePatternRecognizer  in is defined as requiring one input stream containing Image  an Image and as producing a single output stream containing Image  and a Keyword Keyword  such that Image  is describedBy Keyword . Here the preceding Image  is a graphical notation that Image  is a Variable not an Exemplar . This means that the ImagePatterRecognizer  requires an input object represented by a variable Image  and produces the same Imagee  as an output object annotated by a new thing for example  Keyword .

The ImagePatternRecognizer  is defined to perform a few functions that is it conveys a known Image from input to output it creates a new object Exemplar for example a Keyword and it establishes a new relation describedBy.

In order to connect two components together it is first determined if the output of a first component can be connected to the input of a second component and once the components are connected to each other the resulting output produced by the second software component is then determined.

Given the descriptions of inputs and outputs of components a process for determining if an output of a first component can be matched to an input of a second component will now be described. The component matching problem is treated as a graph embedding problem in which the question Can the graph describing the input be embedded in a graph describing another component s output is answered. This approach is different from traditional approaches where matching is generally based on simple type checking alone. The graph embedding approach is more powerful building on the expressivity of semantic graphs.

To formally describe the component matching problem let G V C E represent the input graph where Vis the set of variable modules Cis the set of non variable of constant nodes and Eis the set of edges of the form u p v where node u is related to node v through property p. Similarly let G V C E represent the output graph. Note that Gand Gare directed graphs.

Gcan be embedded in Gif there exists a graph homomorphism f G G that is there is a mapping f V C V Csuch that if u p v Ethen f u f p f v E. In addition for any x C f x x. This means that constant nodes can only be mapped to equivalent constant nodes in the other graph while variable nodes can be mapped to other variable nodes or constant nodes.

In addition DL reasoning is applied to the output graphs to enable more flexible matching. In other words graph Gis expanded with the results of DL reasoning to create graph G . Graph Gis then checked to see if it can be embedded in G . The use of reasoning provides a matching process that is capable of connecting components even if the inputs and outputs are described using different terms. DL reasoning allows inferring new facts based on definitions in the ontology such as subclass and subproperty relationships transitive symmetric inverse and functional properties property restrictions equality and inequality statements etc.

For example as shown in an output graph from HubbleEarthImageSource  is first expanded to include the results of DL reasoning. As a result a type link is added from  HubbleEarthImage  to Image this is obtained from the subclass relationship between InfraredImage and Image . Also a depictedIn link is added from Earth to  HubbleEarthImage  depictedIn defined as an inverse property of imageOf . Next the matching process finds a homomorphism from an input graph of the ImagePatternRecognizer to the output graph of HubbleEarthImageSource . In this homomorphism Image  is mapped to  HubbleEarthImage  since they are both variables and Image is mapped to Image since they are both the same concept . Hence the matching process determines that there is a match.

To help determine the output of a component as a result of drawing data from the outputs of other components a formal functional model of the component is defined. In the model the component can be viewed as performing a graph transformation on the semantic graphs on the inputs to produce semantic graphs on the outputs.

Note that there may be an overlap between and . Now assume that the m input graphs have been matched to m outputs generated by other components that is Lis matched to Xfor i 1 . . . m. The outputs Ycoming from this component are determined as a result of connecting the inputs Xto the component using a graph homomorphism 

3. f f and f f where represents the graph difference operation. This means that exactly that part of is deleted which is matched by elements of not in and exactly that part of is created that is matched by elements new in .

Using properties and the outputs Y of a component can be determined as a result of connecting Xto the component. An example of this process is shown in where the output of the ImagePatternRecognizer  is generated based on the input that is connected to the ImagePatternRecognizer  .

A semantic planner for automatically generating stream processing graphs from processing requests and semantic descriptions of components will now be discussed. The semantic planner enhances traditional AI planning techniques to plan on domains expressed in ontologies. Processing requests in this case user queries are expressed as semantic graph patterns. The planner recursively connects components to each other using the methods described above until it arrives at an outcome description that can be matched to the request specification or until no new output descriptions can be produced. In addition the planner satisfies various constraints such as privacy and security and produces optimal plans for a given resource consumption range.

As shown in an exemplary semantic planner consists of three main components a Stream Processing Planning Language SPPL Generator a DL Reasoner and a Plan Solver. The SPPL Generator takes OWL files describing processing components and data sources and compiles them into a planning domain represented in the intermediate language SPPL as described for example in A. Riabov Z. Liu Planning for Stream Processing Systems in Proceeding of AAAI 2005 July 2005 a copy of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The SPPL Generator makes use of the DL Reasoner to make inferences about the software component descriptions and inserts these inferences as facts into the domain description. In addition to semantic descriptions of inputs and outputs the planning domain also includes descriptions of other compositional operational constraints such as security and privacy constraints. In addition to creating the domain file the SPPL Generator translates each stream query into a goal description in SPPL. The Plan Solver then parses the generated domain and problem SPPL files and produces optimal plans using a backward chaining branch and bound algorithm as described for example A. Riabov Z. Liu Planning for Stream Processing Systems in Proceeding of AAAI 2005 July 2005. The Plan Solver solves the graph embedding problem by deducing appropriate mappings of variables in the input graph to nodes in the output graph. In this planning process multi objective optimization is carried out including for example computational cost and result quality. A Minerva Reasoner which is a highly scalable reasoner operating on a description logic program DLP which is an expressive subset of DL may be used as the DL Reasoner.

When the planner is given a processing request the planner searches for multiple alternative plans visiting processing component descriptions and traversing potentially large associated input and output description graphs many times. Incurring the overhead of DL reasoning on each visit could have a huge negative impact on performance. This is overcome by adopting a two phase approach performing a priori reasoning over graphs of asserted and inferred facts caching expanded graphs for later use during query compilation. Because the products of the reasoning have been cached no DL reasoning need be used while searching for viable processing graphs.

An example of a stream processing graph generated by the semantic planner in response to a request for hurricane associated images is shown in . It is to be understood that although only one processing graph is shown in the semantic planner can assemble several alternative processing graphs. The processing graph shown in draws on two data sources feeding three operators components to produce a sink including hurricane associated images for example images that contain possible storm pattern and images that were taken around that same time a hurricane was reported. depicts the same processing graph as shown in however here semantic graphs describing each data source s outputs  out each component s inputs  in and outputs  out and the sink s inputs  in are provided.

As can be gleaned from a review of it can be difficult to select from among a large set of data sources and processing components to compose such a graph manually. For example even with the relatively small number of operators depicted in the processing graph the work needed to identify appropriate elements and to match outputs to inputs can be daunting especially for matches requiring reasoning. Since most processing graphs involve many more operators manual composition of even one graph is tedious and manual composition of multiple alternative processing graphs is impracticable. Hence automated compilation approaches such as planning are essential for compiling processing requests into processing graphs.

It is to be understood that a target environment for above referenced embodiments is a System S Stream Processing Core SPC see which is a scalable distributed runtime for stream processing of unstructured data. The SPC provides a set of components for managing stream processing applications under heavy workload. Processing graphs submitted to the SPC are described in a Job Description Language JDL specifying the set of processing element PE instances to be deployed and the data stream connections between them. The runtime environment on each of the SPC nodes includes a Data Fabric for managing data flows and a PE Controller that manages execution of PEs deployed on the node. Structured and or unstructured data is sent between the PEx packaged in Stream Data Object SDO format. A Graph Manager component controls I O channels of the data fabric and a Resource Manager manages dynamic allocation of PE instances to nodes subject to various resource constraints.

In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention a means of describing processing outcomes in such a way that stream processing applications that satisfy these requests can be generated is provided. In this way stream processing applications can be assembled more dynamically in seconds or minutes as opposed to days or months taking into account many more considerations security privacy resource availability and consumption etc. than most users could fathom let alone have the time or patience to accommodate. A key characteristic of the request specification called an inquiry specification in the stream processing environment is its declarative nature.

By using the present invention a user can describe solely the intended processing outcome not needing to know nor be required to express the details of how the processing outcome is to be fulfilled. The method has the effect of preventing over specification of stream processing requests. Thus an application planner can discover better ways of accommodating the request better data sources to draw from better algorithms to apply and the assembly of more effective and or efficient applications than the requester might envision. Here users need only describe their requests and convey their constraints if any on how the request is to be fulfilled and need a mechanism preferably automated whereby various ways to fulfill their request can be generated compared pruned and applied.

By providing a means of conveying the goals for processing outcome and doing so using semantic descriptions built according to an explicitly represented semantic model the user is freed from the burden of knowing and applying some set of operators to produce some outcome. This allows the work of two different groups of people those conveying their request and those developing and describing stream processing application components to proceed in parallel. The present invention makes this possible by allowing the first group to convey their requests without having any knowledge of which data sources or processing methods are available for use or how they must be assembled.

Request specifications are semantically described expressed by graph patterns represented as triple patterns describing both the goal of the processing request and the constraints on the resultant processing graphs. Expressivity is similar to that of the SPARQL RDF query language a language used to encode the triple patterns. Request specifications are different from SPARQL queries in that they express outcomes beyond those of information production and are used not as input to a query processor but for matching the outcomes to components in automatically assembled processing graphs.

In the case of information production requests it is to be understood that the semantic based approach to querying stream processing systems described above uses an inquiry specification language ISL for semantically specifying streams. The ISL which is the IBM System S Inquiry Specification Language is built on existing technologies including XML Schema for the top level encoding of request specifications OWL DL for representing the domain and system concepts and relations to the semantic schema for the data being queried and SPARQL Query Language for RDF to capture the semantic expression of Where clauses. The ISL XML Schema makes use of the XML Substitution Group mechanism for extensibility of key specification elements such as new types of goals preferences or result dispositions.
