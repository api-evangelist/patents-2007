title: Test apparatus to determine the shear strength of a composite sandwich beam under a high hydrostatic load
abstract: An apparatus for determining the strength of composite sandwich beam in which an enclosure and insertable bladder is provided. The apparatus comprises positioning a bladder within the enclosure. The beam to be tested is slid through a cutout or aperture of the enclosure with support feet holding the beam in place within the enclosure. The enclosure supports the bladder sides with one face of the bladder pressuring the composite sandwich beam. For testing, water is pumped under pressure through a fitting into the bladder. The tolerances between the beam, enclosure and an extrusion seal do not allow the bladder to squeeze outward with the result being measurable testing pressure on the face of the composite beam.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to an apparatus and method of use for determining the shear strength of a composite sandwich beam using measurable hydrostatic loads.

A composite sandwich is a load bearing structure that typically has thin but stiff face sheets and a lightweight but soft core. This type of structure offers an excellent strength to weight ratio. For this reason composite sandwiches are increasingly considered for use in naval structures such as boat hulls and pressure vessels i.e. launch canisters and torpedo tubes .

When a composite sandwich is loaded with a force normal to the face sheet the core is loaded in shear. Failure of the core in shear is a prevalent failure mode of composite sandwiches.

The historical method of testing the shear strength of a composite sandwich is to test a composite beam in a three or four point bend. The three or four point bend test method creates stress concentrations under the loading points. These stress concentrations would not be located in a real world situation when a sandwich panel would be loaded under a hydrostatic load. Also the stress concentrations can cause premature failure of the composite sandwich panel. This failure is particularly true in cases where the core material is brittle or very soft.

As such a need exists for loading over the face or faces of a composite sandwich panel or beam such that stress concentrations of loading can be eliminated or reduced when a shear strength test is conducted on the composite sandwich beam.

It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a device and a method of testing the shear strength of a composite sandwich beam with a hydrostatic load.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a device and method of testing the shear strength of a composite sandwich beam such that stress concentrations of loading can be eliminated or reduced.

To attain the objects described there is provided a test apparatus including a rubber bladder positioned and sized to fit inside an enclosure. The composite sandwich beam to be tested is slid through a cutout of the box enclosure. At least two pins are slid and fit to hold at least two feet in place at an end of the box enclosure. The feet act as a support platform to hold the composite sandwich beam within the box enclosure during hydrostatic testing.

With the composite sandwich beam resting on the feet there is only a small amount of clearance between the composite sandwich beam the sides of the enclosure and top of the cutouts. As such the enclosure supports the sides of the bladder with an end of the bladder pressuring the composite sandwich beam.

To load for hydrostatic testing water or an alternate fluid is pumped under pressure through a pressure fitting into the bladder. The tight tolerances between the composite sandwich beam the box enclosure and an optional extrusion seal do not allow the bladder to extrude with the result being hydrostatic pressure on the face of the composite sandwich beam.

The hydrostatic pressure can be increased decreased or cycled at the pressure fitting to predetermined levels suitable for testing the composite sandwich beam. Heating and cooling can also be applied to the test apparatus and test composite sandwich beam at predetermined levels.

As stated above the feet provide support to the composite sandwich beam and minimize the stress concentrations on the surface and at the end of the composite sandwich beam. The feet are permitted to rotate on positioning pins to remain tangent to the surface of the composite sandwich beam as the beam bends. The adjustable feet even permit testing of a composite sandwich beam that is tapered in thickness.

An advantage of the present invention is that high pressures can be obtained with the test apparatus by the use of the pressure fitting. The ability to test to high pressures is necessary when characterizing systems used in undersea applications. The apparatus could conceivably be designed for operational testing pressures as high as nominally 4500 pounds per square foot plus any desired test beam safety factors.

A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals and symbols designate identical and corresponding parts throughout several views and wherein a test apparatus of the present invention is primarily depicted in . with variants and optional equipment depicted in subsequent figures as described below.

In and during assembly for testing a top plate is positioned to sandwich a flange of a rubber or elastomeric bladder against the lip of a box enclosure forming a seal between both. The assembly of the top plate to the box enclosure is by bolting clamping together or fastening by any mechanical means known to those skilled in the art.

The bladder is sized to fit inside of the box enclosure . The length L of the bladder is optimally sized with the width W and thickness T to similar dimensions of testable composite sandwich beams. The flange or sealing lip of the bladder may be further restrained to prevent extruding under testing pressure.

Additionally the box enclosure may be substituted with any enclosure suitable for accommodating the bladder . Variants of the enclosures used for the apparatus are depicted in and .

In a first variant depicted in a box enclosure utilizes an integrated top plate . The bladder is inserted from an opposite open end or bottom of the box enclosure . The bladder fluidly connects to a pressure fitting and a relief drain fitting . The fluid flow to and from pressure fitting and the relief drain fitting is controlled by shutoff valves not shown or by other control mechanisms known to these skilled in the art. The relief drain fitting may include tubing not shown that extends to a small distance above a bottom or opposite end of the interior of the bladder .

A second and third variant of the box enclosures shown in and are reinforced versions of the box enclosure with thickened sections encompassing the box enclosure.

The second variant enclosure is shown in with an alternate view shown in . In the figure the enclosure is tubular along a longitudinal axis. A top or first section is made of thickened material with a pressure fitting and a relief drain fitting positioned therethrough. Similarly a bottom section is made of thickened material around a cutout . Recesses are positioned in the cutout .

The third variant enclosure is shown in . A top or first section is made of thickened material with thickened reinforcement supports encompassing the enclosure along a longitudinal axis of the enclosure. The top section includes a pressure fitting and a relief drain fitting . Similar to the top section a bottom section is made of sufficiently thickened material around a cutout .

Using as an example for testing using the box enclosure a composite sandwich beam to be tested is slid through a cutout at the bottom end of the box enclosure . The composite sandwich beam can have an excess length beyond a dotted enclosure contact in order to ease positioning of the composite sandwich beam within the box enclosure and to provide sufficient overhang. At least two pins and are slid and fit to hold at least two feet and in place at the bottom of the box enclosure . The feet and act as a support platform to hold the composite sandwich beam within the box enclosure for hydrostatic testing.

The pins and may be substituted by any fixtures known to those skilled in the art. The feet and are allowed to pivot slightly on the pins and . The feet and are rounded off with a camber and coated with an anti friction material for smooth distributed contact with the loaded composite sandwich beam and comparatively easy movement of the composite sandwich beam in and out of the box enclosure .

With the composite sandwich beam resting on the feet and there is only a small amount of clearance between the composite sandwich beam the sides of the box enclosure and top of the cutout . As such the box enclosure supports the sides of the bladder with the bottom of the bladder pressuring an optional flexible extrusion seal shown in and the composite sandwich beam .

To load for hydrostatic testing water is pumped under pressure through a pressure fitting fluidly connecting to the bladder . The water pressure is measured as part of determining the strength of the composite sandwich beam . The hydrostatic pressure can be increased or decreased at the pressure drain fitting to predetermined levels suitable for testing the composite sandwich beam . Once testing is complete the pressure fitting may also be used to drain and de pressurize the bladder .

The tight tolerances between the composite sandwich beam and the box enclosure do not allow the bladder to squeeze outward with the result being hydrostatic pressure on the extrusion seal and on the face of the composite sandwich beam .

As stated above the feet and provide support to the composite sandwich beam and reduce the stress concentrations at the end of the composite sandwich beam. The stress concentrations can be completely eliminated in the most important area which is the middle of the composite sandwich beam . The middle of the composite sandwich beam is where a failure would likely occur.

An advantage of the present invention is that very high pressures can be obtained with the test apparatus by the use of the pressure fittings and . The ability to test to high pressures is necessary when characterizing systems used in undersea applications.

A variety of materials shapes and sizes can be used for the basic components described above. As described further below positioning of the pins and can be made adjustable so that the support feet and and therefore the thickness of the composite sandwich beam can be varied. These adjustments allow a plurality of beams to be properly positioned in the box enclosure .

The side walls of the box enclosure can also be made adjustable for the same reasons. Shims can also be used for the purpose of adjusting the size of the bladder within the box enclosure to fit composite sandwich beams of various widths.

The pins and the feet may be used on the variants of the box enclosure . In and the alternate view of the composite sandwich beam to be tested is slid through a cutout . The pins and are slid into the recesses and fit to hold the feet and in place at the bottom of the enclosure . The feet and act as a support platform to hold the composite sandwich beam within the enclosure for hydrostatic testing of the composite sandwich beam.

The composite sandwich beam rests on the feet and with only a small amount of clearance between the composite sandwich beam the sides of the box enclosure and top of the cutouts . As such the box enclosure supports the sides of the bladder with the bottom of the bladder pressuring the composite sandwich beam and the extrusion seal shown in . The perimeter of the extrusion seal may be formed or manufactured to conform to the cutout by means recognizable to those skilled in the art.

To load for hydrostatic testing water is supplied under pressure through a pressure fitting fluidly connecting to the bladder . The tight tolerances between the composite sandwich beam and the enclosure do not allow the bladder to squeeze outward with the result being hydrostatic pressure on the extrusion seal See and on the face of the composite sandwich beam. The hydrostatic pressure can be increased or decreased at the pressure fitting to predetermined levels suitable for testing the composite sandwich beam .

As shown in and the extrusion seal is a flexible seal with a reinforced lip edge. As shown in the figures the extrusion seal is capable of directing the volumized bladder to apply pressure to the composite beam rather than extruding around the support feet and . depicts the bladder fully pressurized

As shown in a snubber may be added to mitigate deflection or catastrophe break of the composite sandwich beam on the feet and or other associated parts of the test apparatus . The high durometer rubber snubber can contain a switch that inactivates a pump not shown or activates a valve not shown to shut off the supply to the pressure fitting and . The bladder should not expand further in direction A when the pump is off or the supply is cut off to the pressure fittings and .

A strain gage can be positioned on the composite sandwich beam for remote and or instantaneous measurements during pressure testing. The snubber and switch are preferably set on a stable surface beneath the test apparatus . Deflection measuring devices can also be incorporated in and around the snubber to contact the composite sandwich beam .

As shown in an indexor clamp and indexor bolt will retain a pre positioned bushing in the box enclosure . Although not all shown in each indexor clamp and indexor bolt will typically be provided for each bushing . The vernier bushings are positioned using index marks and or an indexor pin A to hold and position the composite sandwich beam . The bushing is held within the box enclosure by washers and secured with snaprings spiral rings or any other attachment means known to those skilled in the art. The vernier bushing encompasses a journal or roller bearing for minimal rotational pin friction. The journal bearings and the vernier bushings secure and support each pin and . The pins and support the feet and with the bushings providing vertical adjustment and hold the composite sandwich beam in contact with the face of the bladder .

As shown in the vernier bushing with any offset may be rotated in either direction and held in position by the indexor clamp using index marks and or indexor pin A to position the pins or pin not shown in the figures. The bushing may include notches to move the pins and in increments along an x and or y horizontal vertical axis plane perpendicular to the pins moving the feet and vertically permitting the composite sandwich beam to contact the bladder . All offset bushings on the same positioning pins and must be rotated together in the same direction and position to maintain the pins on axis parallel to the bushing holes in the enclosure . The pins and will move in the x y direction in a plane perpendicular to the bushing holes in the enclosure when vertically adjusted with the bushings. To provide equal and opposite x x positioning with the two separate pins the two bushings on one pin should be rotated in equal and opposite directions of the bushings on the other pin providing equal y y adjustments. Bushings may be rotated separately only if the pins are not in place.

As shown in a first variant vernier bushing with a large offset is used to adjust the pin and in a varying position when rotated in either direction. The location of the journal or roller bearing may be concentric no offset within a second variant vernier bushing as shown in and not adjustable. A small offset is shown with a third variant vernier bushing in . With a large offset the journal and the first variant vernier bushing are never concentric with each other. Even with a small offset the journal and the third variant vernier bushing are also never concentric with each other. In both non concentric and offset variants rotation of the bushing moves the support feet along the x and y axis thereby altering hydraulic testing to impact slightly different areas of the composite beam . Only the second variant bushing is concentric with the journal .

The vertical height dimension of an example foot relative to the axis of the pin in the feet may be manufactured in varying height sets to accommodate composite sandwich beams of different thicknesses. This would be accomplished in conjunction with adjusting the pin and bushing sets in the enclosure. A center of gravity of the feet and below the axis of the pins would ensure the top surface remains level with the composite sandwich beam during assembly.

Shimming on top of surfaces of the feet is a further adjustment option. Using two three or four sides of basically square cross sectioned feet there would accommodate large varying thicknesses of composite sandwich beams. More specifically and as shown in a shim of varying thickness can be attached to a rectangular first variant foot A. The shim may be attached by flush mounted bolting A gluing or other attachment means known to those skilled in the art. Also each shim can be rounded at the ends of the shim for case of movement. Another first variant foot A is similar in design and function to the first variant foot A but is not shown in the figure.

It will be understood that many additional changes in details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been described herein and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
