The sharing of photographic and other data stored on mobile data storage devices such as cell phones cameras personal digital assistants etc. currently poses various difficulties. For example currently a mobile device user may share such data by first transferring the data to a computer and then sharing the data by email by uploading to a network server etc. However such sharing processes may take many user steps and may be difficult to perform while a user is away from a home computer for example when on vacation while at a restaurant etc. Therefore in these settings photos are often shared by passing the mobile data storage device from person to person to view the photos on the device display. Due to the small size of such displays it may be difficult for more than one or two people to simultaneously view a photograph.

Some mobile devices such as cellular phones may be equipped to send photographs and other such data to other devices over a cellular network. However per transaction costs may be high for sending such data. Additionally each transaction may involve multiple user steps. Further the generally small sizes of mobile device displays may limit the number of persons who can view the data on the receiving device and therefore may reduce user satisfaction with the sharing experience.

Likewise some mobile data storage devices equipped with wireless communications technologies such as Bluetooth IEEE 802.15.1 and WiFi IEEE 802.11x may be configured to allow the sharing of data with other similarly equipped devices. However sharing content via such technology also may involve many user steps to connect to and transfer content between devices. Eliminating steps to improve the user experience may pose problems where more than one data storage device is detected within communication range as it may be difficult for each device to identify which device of the detected devices data is to be transferred to or from without user input steps.

Accordingly the automatic identification of a data storage device by a touch sensitive interactive display device to which data in the data storage device may be transferred for display to a plurality of users is described below in the Detailed Description. For example in one embodiment a data storage device detected on a touch sensitive surface of a display device is identified by detecting the data storage device on a wireless communications channel and then confirming that the data storage device detected on the wireless communications channel is the data storage device detected on the surface of the display device by communicating with the data storage device over a second communications channel. This may allow the display device to identify the data storage device from among multiple data storage devices detected on the wireless communications channel and thereby to receive data only from the identified data storage device.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.

Interactive display device may be configured to receive data from and or to transfer data to any suitable type of mobile data storage device. Examples of such mobile data storage devices include but are not limited to mobile computing devices such as laptop computers hand held devices cellular phones portable media players personal digital assistants cameras video cameras and other microprocessor based or microcontroller based programmable consumer electronics and or appliances. As used herein the term computing device may include any device that electronically executes one or more programs and data storage device may include any device with a computer readable storage medium capable of storing computer readable data and or other content. The embodiments described herein may be implemented on such devices for example via computer executable instructions or code such as programs stored on a computer readable storage medium and executed by the computing device. Generally programs include routines objects components data structures and the like that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The term program as used herein may connote a single program or multiple programs acting in concert and may be used to denote applications services or any other type or class of program. Interactive display device may also be configured to receive data from devices other than computing devices including but not limited to data storage devices such as flash drives etc. having communications capabilities.

Turning again to the depicted interactive display device comprises a horizontal table like top surface having a touch sensitive display screen . As described in more detail below a user may transfer data to interactive display device from a suitably enabled mobile data storage device simply by placing mobile data storage device on touch sensitive display screen . Interactive display device detects the presence and location of mobile data storage device on touch sensitive display screen connects to mobile data storage device via a wireless communications channel receives data from mobile data storage device over the wireless communications channel and displays the data on touch sensitive display screen . The data then may be viewed and in some embodiments manipulated via touch sensitive display screen by a group of persons seated around interactive display device . In this manner photographs and other data stored on mobile data storage device may be shared by a group of users in a simple and intuitive manner. While described herein in the context of an interactive display device having a horizontal table like display surface it will be appreciated that interactive display device may include a display having any other suitable orientation including but not limited to vertical and diagonal orientations.

At times more than one mobile data storage device may be placed on touch sensitive display screen as shown in at . Likewise at times one or more mobile data storage devices may be detected on wireless communications channel but not located on touch sensitive display screen . In order for interactive display device to determine the identities of those data storage devices from which to receive data as well as the appropriate location and orientation on interactive display device to display the data interactive display device may be configured to distinguish mobile data storage devices that are placed on touch sensitive display screen from devices not placed on touch sensitive display screen . Interactive display device may also be configured to identify the specific locations on touch sensitive display screen at which each mobile data storage device is placed. This may allow interactive display device to display data received from each device in a location associated with the transfer or device and also not to download and or display data from devices that are detected on wireless communication channel but not placed on touch sensitive surface .

Next method includes confirming at that the mobile data storage device detected on the wireless communications channel is the data storage device detected on the surface of the display device by communicating with the data storage device over a second communications channel. Once interactive display device has confirmed that the data storage device detected on the wireless communications channel is the data storage device detected on the touch sensitive display data may be transferred from mobile data storage device to the interactive display device for display on display surface .

The presence and location of mobile data storage device on the touch sensitive display may be determined in any suitable manner. For example in some embodiments touch sensitive display screen may include an electrically sensitive touch sensitive mechanism for example a capacitive or resistive mechanism capable of locating an object placed on touch sensitive display screen . In other embodiments interactive display device may include an image capture device configured to capture an image of touch sensitive display screen to detect infrared or visible light reflected from objects placed on touch sensitive display screen . In these embodiments motion of an object on touch sensitive screen may be detected by capturing images of touch sensitive display screen at a suitably high sample rate for example between 20 and 100 Hz to track object motion on screen . Various embodiments of interactive display device are described in more detail below.

Likewise the presence of mobile data storage device on the wireless communications channel may be detected in any suitable manner. For example interactive display device may send an intermittent and or periodic beacon over wireless communications channel to alert mobile data storage devices within range of its presence and devices receiving the beacon may connect to interactive display device in response to the beacon. Alternatively interactive display device may send a beacon over wireless communications channel only when an object is detected on touch sensitive surface . In either these embodiments display as well as other electronic systems may remain dormant until activity is detected by the wireless communications channel or the touch screen interface. This may allow interactive display device to assume a deeper power save mode during periods of inactivity such as during the night. It will be appreciated that interactive display device may be configured to communicate with and receive data from mobile data storage device via any suitable wireless communications technology. Examples include but are not limited to radiofrequency technologies such as 802.11x technologies Bluetooth technologies active or passive radiofrequency identification RFID technologies etc.

Continuing with interactive display device may confirm at the identification of the mobile data storage device via communication with mobile data storage device over any suitable second communications channel. Suitable channels include those channels that are sensitive to a position of mobile data storage device on touch sensitive display screen . Specific examples include but are not limited to optical and electromagnetic second communications channels such as the touch sensitive mechanism of touch sensitive display screen . For example where interactive display device utilizes a capacitive resistive or other electrical touch sensing mechanism the electrical touch sensing mechanism may be used to detect a modulated electrical signal emitted by mobile data storage device . Likewise where interactive display device utilizes an image capture device to implement the touch sensitivity of display surface by detecting images of objects on display surface the image capture device may also be used as a second communications channel to receive an optical communication signal from mobile data storage device .

Image source includes an optical or light source such as the depicted lamp an LED array or other suitable light source. Image source also includes an image producing element such as the depicted LCD liquid crystal display an LCOS liquid crystal on silicon display a DLP digital light processing display or any other suitable image producing element. Display screen includes a clear transparent portion such as sheet of glass and a diffuser screen layer disposed on top of the clear transparent portion . In some embodiments an additional transparent layer not shown may be disposed over diffuser screen layer to provide a smooth look and feel to the display surface.

Continuing with interactive display device further includes an electronic controller comprising memory and a microprocessor . Further controller may include a wireless transmitter and receiver configured to conduct two way communication with mobile data storage devices. Wireless transmitter and receiver may be configured to conduct wireless communications with mobile data storage device in any suitable manner including but not limited to via 802.11x Bluetooth RFID or other radiofrequency communications technologies. While shown as part of controller it will be appreciated that wireless transmitter and receiver may also be provided as a separate device in electrical communication with controller .

To sense objects placed on display screen interactive display device includes an image capture device configured to capture an image of the entire backside of display screen and to provide the image to electronic controller for the detection of objects appearing in the image. Diffuser screen layer helps to avoid the imaging of objects that are not in contact with or positioned within a few millimeters of display screen and therefore helps to ensure that only objects that are touching display screen are detected by image capture device .

Image capture device may include any suitable image sensing mechanism. Examples of suitable image sensing mechanisms include but are not limited to CCD and CMOS image sensors. Further the image sensing mechanisms may capture images of display screen at a sufficient frequency to detect motion of an object across display screen . Display screen may alternatively or further include an optional capacitive resistive or other electromagnetic touch sensing mechanism as illustrated by dashed line connection of screen with controller .

Image capture device may be configured to detect reflected or emitted energy of any suitable wavelength including but not limited to infrared and visible wavelengths. To assist in detecting objects placed on display screen image capture device may further include an additional optical source or emitter such as one or more light emitting diodes LEDs configured to produce infrared or visible light. Light from LEDs may be reflected by objects placed on display screen and then detected by image capture device . The use of infrared LEDs as opposed to visible LEDs may help to avoid washing out the appearance of projected images on display screen .

LEDs may be positioned at any suitable location within interactive display device . In the depicted embodiment a plurality of LEDs are placed along a side of display screen . In this location light from the LEDs can travel through display screen via internal reflection while some can escape from display screen for reflection by an object on the display screen . In alternative embodiments one or more LEDs may be placed beneath display screen so as to pass emitted light through display screen .

Continuing with interactive display device includes an electronic controller comprising memory and a microprocessor . Further interactive display device includes a wireless transmitter and receiver configured to conduct two way communication with mobile data storage devices such as device via wireless transmitter and receiver on device .

Interactive display device further includes a plurality of image capture devices depicted as and an optical emitter such as an LED array configured to illuminate a backside of display screen with infrared or visible light. Image capture devices are each configured to capture an image of a portion of display screen and provide the image to controller and to assemble a composite image of the entire display screen from the images. In the depicted embodiment image capture devices are positioned generally beneath the corners of display screen while image capture device is positioned in a location such that it does not pick up glare from LED array reflected by display screen that may be picked up by image capture devices . In this manner images from image capture devices may be combined by controller to produce a complete glare free image of the backside of display screen . This allows detection of an object such as a mobile data storage device placed on display screen . Display screen may alternatively or further include an optional capacitive resistive or other electromagnetic touch sensing mechanism as illustrated by dashed line connection of screen with controller .

In the embodiments of image capture devices and and or an electronically sensitive touch sensing mechanism disposed within touch sensitive display screen may act as a second communications channel between mobile data storage devices and interactive display device . Either of these mechanisms may be capable of communicating with the depicted interactive display devices and in a manner that expresses the position of the devices on the display screen. This enables the interactive display devices and to conduct a locating communication session with a mobile data storage device in which the mobile data storage device sends or receives a specific message across the second communications channel in response to a specific request for that message sent by the interactive display device across the wireless communications channel.

Method first includes detecting at an object placed on display screen and detecting at a data storage device on a wireless communications channel via wireless communications transmitter and receiver . Next to determine whether the object detected on display screen is the data storage device detected on the wireless communications channel interactive display device sends at a request over the wireless communications channel to the data storage device for the data storage device to send a locating message over the second communications channel.

If the object detected on display screen is the data storage device to which the request was sent then interactive display device receives at the locating message. On the other hand if the object on display screen is not the data storage device detected on the wireless communications channel then interactive display device will not receive the locating message due to the position sensitive nature of the second communications channel. In this manner interactive display device determines at the identity of a data storage device on the surface of the display screen based on receipt of the locating message. Data may then be downloaded from the data storage device for display on display screen .

The locating message sent by the data storage device over the second communications channel may take any suitable form. For example in some embodiments the data storage device includes an infrared emitter. Upon receipt of a request to send a locating message the data storage device emits infrared light via the infrared light emitter. The emitted infrared light may be received by image capture devices and detected in the images from image capture devices by controller . In alternative embodiments the data storage device includes a second electromagnetic modulator. Upon receipt of a request to send a locating message the data storage device emits a modulated electromagnetic signal which may be detected by a suitable detection mechanism associated with display screen .

Method may also be used to locate and identify a plurality of mobile data storage devices placed on display screen . For example where four users each place a mobile data storage device on display screen interactive display device may determine which mobile data storage device is located at which position on touch sensitive display screen by requesting each mobile data storage device to send a locating message that is distinguishable from the locating message sent by the other data storage devices. For example in some embodiments the mobile data storage device may be requested to send a locating message at different times. In other embodiments each mobile data storage device may be asked to send a different locating message for example a different number or pattern of emitted signals. In this manner each mobile data storage device that is detected on interactive display device may be distinguished from other mobile data storage devices located on interactive display device as well as mobile data storage devices that are within wireless detection range but are not located on interactive display device .

Further as described above image capture device may acquire images of display screen at a sufficient frequency to allow the motion of objections on display screen to be tracked. Therefore once a mobile data storage device has been identified and located on display screen movements of the device on display screen may be tracked thereby allowing the device to be moved without having to repeat the identification process. If the mobile data storage device is not successfully tracked or is lifted from display screen during movement the locating process may be again performed to identify and locate the device on display screen . Alternatively interactive display device may be configured to periodically and or continuously renew device identifications or to renew identifications whenever a device is moved.

The wireless and second communications mechanisms described above may be implemented in any suitable manner on mobile data storage devices. Some mobile data storage devices may be manufactured with suitable communications mechanisms build into the devices. For example wireless technologies such as 802.11x and Bluetooth are integrated into many portable data storage devices including but not limited to cell phones PDAs and cameras. Likewise many portable data storage devices also include infrared data ports. Therefore such devices may be configured via software or hardware for example to conduct a locating communication with interactive display device using standard included equipment. On the other hand some devices may not include standard equipment that may be used for communicating over the wireless and second communications channels. Therefore a simple communications tag may be attached to or incorporated into these devices to enable these devices to be located on and identified by interactive display device .

In some embodiments tag system is electronically passive and acquires all operating power from an interrogating RF field. In alternative embodiments tag system is electronically active in that it includes a power supply. Where tag system is an active tag it may include an on board power supply i.e. on the tag itself or may be connected to a power supply on the device on which tag system is included.

Any suitable event may be used to trigger microcontroller to cause second modulation device to send a locating signal at any suitable time. For example in some embodiments microcontroller may be configured to receive a request from interactive display device to send the modulating signal and then may direct second modulation device to emit the signal upon receipt of the request. In alternative embodiments microcontroller may be configured to alert interactive display device via the RF identification channel that it will send a specific locating message via second modulator and then may send the locating message after sending the alert. In either case the locating operation is performed by two way communication via the wireless communications channel and one way communication from tag system to interactive display device via the second communications channel.

It will be appreciated that tag system may include both an optical or electrical emitter and an optical or electrical receiver. In these embodiments tag system and interactive display device may conduct a two way locating communication in which each device both sends and receives a locating signal. Various embodiments of mobile devices with optical receivers are described in more detail below.

In some embodiments tag system may be used to transfer more information to interactive display device than a unique identification number. For example in some embodiments tag system may be configured to transfer data such as photographic data video data etc. for display on interactive display device via the RFID communications channel.

Further it will be appreciated that tag system may have applicability beyond identifying a mobile data storage device on touch sensitive display screen . For example tag system may be placed on any desired object to allow interactive display device to identify and interact with that object. As one example tag system may be included on a card issued to and linked specifically to a guest at a resort amusement park or other such entertainment facility. While the user is at the entertainment facility photographs may be taken of the guest performing various activities such as riding rides participating in sports activities etc. and may be displayed at a kiosk to the user for selection after the activity has included. As a specific example a roller coaster may include a camera configured to photograph all of the riders as the roller coaster cars pass by the camera.

Upon conclusion of the ride a rider may view the photographs at a kiosk scan the card to alert the kiosk of the identity of the person making the selection and then select photographs in which the rider and or the rider s friends and or family appear. Then at a later time and or different location for example in a hotel lobby or in a coffee house or restaurant affiliated with the resort the rider may place the card on the surface of an interactive display device . The device may determine the identity of the holder of the card by receiving the unique ID of the card holder via RFID tag query a database to determine those photos previously selected by the rider and then download those photos for display on display screen .

Furthermore where multiple cards are placed on the table interactive display device may determine where each detected card is located on display screen via second modulator and then display the downloaded photos in locations and orientations based upon the location of the cards on the table. It will be appreciated that tag system may be used to allow interactive display device to uniquely identify any other suitable object such as drinks glasses or plates placed on display screen for enabling drink or food ordering through touch sensitive display screen etc. Further other indication indicia may be included on tag system or elsewhere on an object to allow an orientation of an object to be determined. shows a schematic depiction of a tag system having a second modulator and a plurality of other optical indicators . For example the relative locations of the signal from second modulator and the detected positions of other optical indicators may be detected by interactive display device . The orientation of the object may then be determined by comparing the positions of second modulator and other optical indicators to a database containing information on the location of optical indicators on tags.

Optical indicators may also serve to identify the device on which tag system is located as one including a second optical or electrical communications channel. This allows the display device to ignore objects that do not possess such a communications channel. Further optical indicators also may be used to locate the secondary communications channel on large and or complex devices so the display surface does not have to know the location of the secondary communications channel for all present and future devices. Additionally optical indicators can act as a visual cue to a user in that the optical indicators may indicate to the user which surface of the object such as a surface having a camera lens should be placed in contact with the display surface.

Additionally optical indicators may simplify the tracking of devices moved on the display surface. For example once the identity of a device has been determined and associated with the optical indicators located on that device the device may be identified at any location on the display surface simply by reading optical indicators . Further changes in the orientation of tag system may be detected by tracking the changes in the positions of optical indicators and or second modulator . This may allow the rotation of an object including tag system on display screen to be used as an input to interactive display device . Such an input could be used for example to trigger a change in a displayed image to cause a scrolling menu displayed on touch sensitive display screen to scroll or to trigger any other desired functionality in interactive display device .

Any suitable optically readable symbol or arrangement of symbols may be used as optical indicators . For example in one embodiment optical indicators may take the form of a barcode. In alternative embodiments optical indicators may comprise optically reflecting or absorbing shapes such as circles triangles rectangles etc. Different sizes and or arrangements of shapes may be used to identify various objects. Furthermore in other alternative embodiments more than one second modulator may be provided thereby allowing tag orientation and or object orientation to be determined via the signals from the plurality of second modulators.

Depending upon the configuration of optical indicators optical indicators may provide sufficient bit depth to be able to uniquely identify objects within a selected environment and may thereby be able to represent both an identity and a location of an object placed on interactive display device . This may allow for the unique identification of an object via an optically reflective passive tag without the use of any RFID or optical emitters located on the tag. For example upon reading such an optically reflective passive tag interactive display device may query a database containing records linking each unique optical tag pattern to a specific device and or device owner to determine the device and or owner linked to that specific tag. In this manner interactive display device may uniquely identify a device detected on display screen from the passive tag alone without any optical or electrical signal emitted by the tag.

An identification tag may also be configured to receive a locating signal from interactive display device via a second communications channel. shows a block diagram of another embodiment of an identification tag system configured to receive a locating signal sent by interactive display device . Tag system comprises an RFID tag with a microcontroller memory on which a unique identifier is stored an RF modulator an RF antenna and an optical detector configured to detect an optical signal emitted by interactive display device . As described above for tag system tag system may be a passive device powered by an interrogating field or may be an active device with an on board power supply.

Any suitable optically sensitive structure may be used as optical detector and optical detector may be configured to receive any suitable optical signal from interactive display device . For example in some embodiments optical detector may comprise a simple color sensitive or light sensitive detector. In these embodiments interactive display device may be configured to display a selected color on display screen in a location adjacent to tag system to request tag system to acquire an optical data sample from optical detector and then to send the optical data sample to interactive display device via RFID tag and antenna or via another wireless communications channel . Interactive display device may then compare the optical sample to the color displayed on display screen to determine the presence and location of tag system on display screen . Alternatively interactive display device may modulate a color or shades of color displayed on display screen and receive an optical sample of the modulated color from tag system .

Some mobile data storage devices may include an optical detector built into the device. For example many cell phones and PDAs include cameras configured to capture photographic images and or video segments. Therefore such a device may include programming that allows the devices to connect wirelessly to interactive display device and to receive a locating communication from interactive display device via the use of the on board camera as a second communications channel.

Further software architecture includes a sharing service that allows the mobile data storage device to transfer data to and or from interactive display device . Sharing service also may be configured to communicate with interactive display device via a camera or other optical detector on the mobile data storage device.

Method begins at with the interactive display device application finding all mobile data storage devices enabled to share data with interactive display device . Application may find these devices by periodically sending a beacon over wireless network or by sending a beacon over wireless network when an object is detected on interactive display device . Next as indicated at if sharing service is enabled on a mobile device detecting the beacon the mobile device returns a message to display application at alerting the display application of its presence. Processes are performed for each mobile data storage device that receives the beacon and that has its sharing service enabled.

Next at each detected object on the display screen interactive display device may display a unique color or image beneath the object as indicated at . Next as indicated at display application may direct each mobile data storage device detected on wireless network to send a locating message by capturing an image and sending a message related to the captured image to the display application .

Upon receipt of this instruction sharing service on each mobile data storage device directs camera on that device to collect an optical sample by taking a picture as indicated at . Next as shown at camera then takes the picture and returns the picture to sharing service . In some embodiments sharing service may perform some processing of the optical sample or may acquire data from the optical sample such as an average of the colors in the image as shown at .

Next sharing service sends the image data acquired from the image or another such locating message related to the image back to display application over wireless network as shown at . Finally as indicated at display application can then match the image or data acquired from the image to the image that was displayed under the detected object to determine which if any of the mobile data storage devices detected on wireless network corresponds to the detected object. Where more than one object is detected on interactive display device method may also be used to identify and locate each mobile data storage device that is placed on interactive device and distinguish those devices from other objects detected on interactive display device .

In some embodiments interactive display device may display a timed sequence of colors under the detected object rather than a single color. As another alternative interactive display device may be configured to modulate the output from LEDs and or and mobile data storage device may detect the modulated LED output with camera . Furthermore display application may use different techniques for choosing and displaying the color beneath the device to determine if a color works best for a selected device. Additionally sharing service may be configured to process the image acquired by camera to facilitate the identification of the color displayed beneath it. For example such processing may include but is not limited to ignoring blown highlights ignoring areas with no color or clamping the color values to a specific set of colors. Likewise sharing service may be configured to return an error message or no response if camera is unable to see a uniform enough color. Additionally in some embodiments a user may be provided with the option of disabling the secondary communications channel to prevent unauthorized or unintentional communication with the interactive display device. This may provide a user with more control over whether content from the user s device is downloaded to the interactive display device. Furthermore while the above described embodiments utilize automatic location and identification processes to create a smooth user experience it will be appreciated that either a portable data storage device and or an interactive display device may be configured to require acknowledgement and or confirmation from a user before initiating a transfer of data to the interactive display device. For example a portable data storage device with a passive tag with or without a secondary communications channel may be configured to transmit a confirm signal to the display device over a radio frequency communications channel. This confirm signal may be generated in response to a specific device action by the user i.e. pressing a specific button in response to a prompt by the display device i.e. Press confirm to transmit your pictures . In this manner data from a user s device would be transferred to the interactive display device only upon specific authorization by the user.

It will be appreciated that the configurations and or approaches described herein are exemplary in nature and that these specific embodiments or examples are not to be considered in a limiting sense because numerous variations are possible. For example while described herein in the context of an interactive display device having a horizontal table like display surface it will be appreciated that the concepts described herein may also be used with displays of any other suitable orientation including vertically arranged displays. Additionally a portable data storage device may include more than one secondary communications device. For example a device may include a passive optically readable tag an active optical or electromagnetic secondary communications channel and or an on board camera.

Furthermore the specific routines or methods described herein may represent one or more of any number of processing strategies such as event driven interrupt driven multi tasking multi threading and the like. As such various acts illustrated may be performed in the sequence illustrated in parallel or in some cases omitted. Likewise the order of any of the above described processes is not necessarily required to achieve the features and or results of the exemplary embodiments described herein but is provided for ease of illustration and description.

The subject matter of the present disclosure includes all novel and no obvious combinations and sub combinations of the various processes systems and configurations and other features functions acts and or properties disclosed herein as well as any and all equivalents thereof.
