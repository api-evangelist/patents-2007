title: Deceleration apparatus for projectile
abstract: A decelerating apparatus includes a sleeve having a forward end and a rear end. A plurality of helical grooves formed in the sleeve. Each helical groove begins at the forward end of the sleeve and has a depth that decreases from the forward end of the sleeve towards the rear end.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or thereof.

The invention relates in general to projectiles and in particular to projectiles that rapidly decelerate upon impact.

In the case of many munitions it is desirable for the munition to deliver its payload whether explosive or nonexplosive upon impact. In these munitions it is assumed that the point of impact is the desired target. Thus it is undesirable that the munition continue its travel after impact with the target. Continued travel past the target makes the munition less effective. In the case of projectiles or penetrators it is necessary to provide a means for slowing the projectile after impact.

Known methods of accomplishing this task usually involve a soft deformable metal nose some sort of ring shaped flange or a molybolt style device that opens petals. All of these designs increase the presented area of the penetrator through deformation of their structure. The soft metal approach usually involves lead which is very dense. Dense metals are difficult to slow down due to their increased kinetic energy and increased mass. Ring flanges are satisfactory until at least one point on the circumference of the flange fails and then the entire ring fails catastrophically. The molybolt style devices are effective until individual petals break off. As the petals break off the braking action of the molybolt style device is decreased.

A principle purpose of the present invention is to provide a means for slowing a projectile in the most rapid fashion possible on impact in media ranging from sand soil concrete metals plastics water flesh bone etc.

One aspect of the invention is a decelerating apparatus which includes a sleeve having a forward end and a rear end. A plurality of grooves are formed in the sleeve. Each groove begins at the forward end of the sleeve and has a depth that decreases from the forward end towards the rear end of the sleeve. More particularly the plurality of grooves are helical and the depth of each groove at the forward end is large enough so that the groove cuts completely through the sleeve at the forward end.

Another aspect of the invention is a projectile having a body with a decelerating apparatus attached to the body. The decelerating apparatus includes a sleeve having a forward end and a rear end. The sleeve has a plurality of grooves formed in it. Each groove begins at the forward end of the sleeve and has a depth that decreases from the forward end towards the rear end of the sleeve. More particularly the plurality of grooves are helical and the depth of each groove at the forward end is large enough so that the groove cuts completely through the sleeve at the forward end.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

As shown in detail in DA includes a sleeve having a forward end a rear end and a plurality of grooves formed therein. Each groove begins at the forward end of the sleeve . Each groove has a depth that decreases from the forward end of the sleeve towards the rear end . More particularly the grooves are helical although grooves having orientations other than helical are within the scope of the invention.

As best seen in the depth of each groove at the forward end is large enough so that the groove cuts completely through the sleeve at the forward end . The grooves are cut into the sleeve beginning at the forward end and proceeding aft towards the rear end . At first the groove cuts all the way through the thickness of the sleeve . As the groove proceeds aft it begins to only cut part way through the thickness of the sleeve . At the very end of the groove it simply disappears as if the cutting tool were slowly pulled away from the sleeve . In one embodiment the groove makes 90 degrees of rotation in about 0.5 inches of length.

The plurality of grooves define deformable petals therebetween. In the embodiment shown in the number of grooves is six and the number of petals is six. However more or less than six grooves may be used. In the exemplary embodiment as illustrated the grooves are evenly spaced circumferentially around the sleeve and each groove is generally V shaped.

The sleeve shown in the and includes a conical portion followed by a cylindrical portion . In other embodiments the sleeve may be entirely cylindrical or entirely conical. As shown in the it is preferable that the plurality of grooves extend from the conical portion into at least a part of the cylindrical portion .

Upon impact the DA deforms in such a way as to increase the presented area of the projectile into the flow of material around it. This action absorbs the kinetic energy of the projectile allowing it to slow down. The DA enables two distinct mechanisms to take place during deformation. First although the forward end of the grooves are cut completely through the sleeve the remaining portion of the grooves are not cut all the way through the sleeve . Thus in forming the petals the sleeve material has to tear along the grooves thereby consuming large amounts of energy. Second as the grooves tear and the sleeve material folds back to form the petals the mushrooming nature of the helical petals and their tendency to deform into a clumped mass also absorbs energy.

In operation the impacting media deforms the petals rearwards forcing the sleeve material to tear along the helical grooves effectively smashing and mushrooming the petals into a mass of mangled metal in a ring shape near the ends of the grooves . The combination of the tearing of the sleeve material and deformation within the petals both consume energy. In addition as the mushrooming ring is formed there is a dramatic increase in presented area that increases the consumption of energy as the projectile impinges on the impact material. As the helical petals deform they become intertwined and locked providing some structural benefit and helping them to stay in the flow of media longer. Similarly as the petals continue to deform under more and more applied force they simply peel back the material of the sleeve like peeling the paper covering off of a drinking straw.

More particularly the DA is made of a lightweight material such as low density metals like Al Mg Ti or polymers or composites. An advantage of using lightweight materials is that their lower density makes them easier to decelerate thus enabling more dynamic projectile design and function. In contrast in the past the purpose of soft metals and expanding tips in bullets was to present more surface area to thereby increase lethality but there was no desire to reduce kinetic energy. Thus in the past the use of high density lead was appealing. The density of the expected media that the DA will impact determines the material of the DA . For example a plastic or thin metal sleeve may be appropriate for impact with water or flesh a thick plastic or thin metal sleeve for impact with sand plastic or thin metals and a thicker stiffer metal sleeve for impact with hard soil or thicker metals.

DA may be fabricated by any of various techniques including casting molding machining or extrusion. DA may be fabricated integrally with the forward portion of a projectile s body or as an add on structure.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
