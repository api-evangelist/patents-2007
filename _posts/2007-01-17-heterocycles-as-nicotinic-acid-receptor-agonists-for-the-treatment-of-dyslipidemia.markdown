This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 760 555 filed Jan. 20 2006 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to nicotinic acid receptor agonist compounds useful for treating metabolic syndrome dyslipidemia cardiovascular diseases disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system hematological diseases cancer inflammation respiratory diseases gastroenterological diseases diabetes and non alcoholic fatty liver disease pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds pharmaceutical compositions comprising nicotinic acid receptor agonist compounds in combination with other therapeutic agents and methods of treatment using the compounds and compositions to treat conditions such as metabolic syndrome dyslipidemia cardiovascular diseases disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system hematological diseases cancer inflammation respiratory diseases gastroenterological diseases diabetes hepatic steatosis and non alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Nicotinic acid has been used to treat metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia. However nicotinic acid has undesirable side effects such as flushing and diarrhea. It is therefore desirable to provide improved nicotinic acid receptor agonists with improved efficacy at treating metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia yet without the undesirable side effects. The compounds of the present invention provide such improved nicotinic acid receptor agonists.

When any variable e.g. aryl heterocycle R etc. occurs more than one time in any constituent or in Formula I its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.

As used herein the term composition is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts as well as any product which results directly or indirectly from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.

Prodrugs and solvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella Pro drugs as Novel Delivery Systems 1987 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design 1987 Edward B. Roche ed. American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press. The term prodrug means a compound e.g a drug precursor that is transformed in vivo to yield a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt hydrate or solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms e.g. by metabolic or chemical processes such as for example through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of the use of prodrugs is provided by T. Higuchi and W. Stella Pro drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design ed. Edward B. Roche American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press 1987.

For example if a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as for example C C alkyl C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms 1 methyl 1 alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms 1 alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms 1 methyl 1 alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms N alkoxycarbonyl aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms 1 N alkoxycarbonyl amino ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms 3 phthalidyl 4 crotonolactonyl gamma butyrolacton 4 yl di N N C C alkylamino C C alkyl such as dimethylaminoethyl carbamoyl C C alkyl N N di C C alkylcarbamoyl C1 C2 alkyl and piperidino pyrrolidino or morpholino C C alkyl and the like.

Similarly if a compound of Formula I contains an alcohol functional group a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as for example C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl 1 methyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl C C alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl N C C alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl succinoyl C C alkanoyl amino C C alkanyl arylacyl and aminoacyl or aminoacyl aminoacyl where each aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L amino acids P O OH P O O C C alkyl or glycosyl the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate and the like.

If a compound of Formula I incorporates an amine functional group a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as for example R carbonyl RO carbonyl NRR carbonyl where R and R are each independently C C alkyl C C cycloalkyl benzyl or R carbonyl is a natural aminoacyl or natural aminoacyl C OH C O OYwherein Yis H C C alkyl or benzyl C OY Ywherein Yis C C alkyl and Yis C C alkyl carboxy C C alkyl amino C C alkyl or mono N or di N N C C alkylaminoalkyl C Y Ywherein Yis H or methyl and Yis mono N or di N N C C alkylamino morpholino piperidin 1 yl or pyrrolidin 1 yl and the like.

One or more compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water ethanol and the like and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. Solvate means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. Solvate encompasses both solution phase and isolatable solvates. Non limiting examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates methanolates and the like. Hydrate is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is HO.

One or more compounds of the invention may optionally be converted to a solvate. Preparation of solvates is generally known. Thus for example M. Caira et al J. Pharmaceutical Sci. 93 3 601 611 2004 describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl acetate as well as from water. Similar preparations of solvates hemisolvate hydrates and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al MPS Pharm Sci Tech. 5 1 article 12 2004 and A. L. Bingham et al Chem. Commun. 603 604 2001 . A typical non limiting process involves dissolving the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent organic or water or mixtures thereof at a higher than ambient temperature and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as for example I. R. spectroscopy show the presence of the solvent or water in the crystals as a solvate or hydrate .

 Effective amount or therapeutically effective amount is meant to describe an amount of compound or a composition of the present invention effective in inhibiting the diseases or conditions noted below and thus producing the desired therapeutic ameliorative inhibitory or preventative effect.

The compounds of Formula I can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of Formula I herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof unless otherwise indicated. The term salt s as employed herein denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and or organic acids as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and or organic bases. In addition when a compound of Formula I contains both a basic moiety such as but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole and an acidic moiety such as but not limited to a carboxylic acid zwitterions inner salts may be formed and are included within the term salt s as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable i.e. non toxic physiologically acceptable salts are preferred although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the Formula I may be formed for example by reacting a compound of Formula I with an amount of acid or base such as an equivalent amount in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.

Additionally acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed for example by P. Stahl et al Camille G. eds. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties Selection and Use. 2002 Zurich Wiley VCH S. Berge et al Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 1977 66 1 1 19 P. Gould International J. of Pharmaceutics 1986 33 201 217 Anderson et al The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry 1996 Academic Press New York and in The Orange Book Food Drug Administration Washington D.C. on their website . These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference thereto.

Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts alkali metal salts such as sodium lithium and potassium salts alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts salts with organic bases for example organic amines such as dicyclohexylamines t butyl amines and salts with amino acids such as arginine lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides e.g. methyl ethyl and butyl chlorides bromides and iodides dialkyl sulfates e.g. dimethyl diethyl and dibutyl sulfates long chain halides e.g. decyl lauryl and stearyl chlorides bromides and iodides aralkyl halides e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others.

All such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.

Pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the present compounds include the following groups 1 carboxylic acid esters obtained by esterification of the hydroxy groups in which the non carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid portion of the ester grouping is selected from straight or branched chain alkyl for example acetyl n propyl t butyl or n butyl alkoxyalkyl for example methoxymethyl aralkyl for example benzyl aryloxyalkyl for example phenoxymethyl aryl for example phenyl optionally substituted with for example halogen C C alkyl or C C alkoxy or amino 2 sulfonate esters such as alkyl or aralkylsulfonyl for example methanesulfonyl 3 amino acid esters for example L valyl or L isoleucyl 4 phosphonate esters and 5 mono di or triphosphate esters. The phosphate esters may be further esterified by for example a C C alcohol or reactive derivative thereof or by a 2 3 di C C acyl glycerol.

The compounds of Formula I may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I as well as mixtures thereof including racemic mixtures and including those of the salts solvates esters and prodrugs of the compounds as well as the salts solvates and esters of the prodrugs form part of the present invention. In addition the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers as well as enantiomeric forms which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons rotameric forms atropisomers e.g. substituted biaryls and diastereomeric forms. For example if a compound of Formula I incorporates a double bond or a fused ring both the cis and trans forms as well as mixtures are embraced within the scope of the invention.

Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may for example be substantially free of other isomers or may be admixed for example as racemates or with all other or other selected stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms salt solvate ester prodrug and the like is intended to equally apply to the salt solvate ester and prodrug of enantiomers stereoisomers rotamers tautomers positional isomers racemates or prodrugs of the inventive compounds.

Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as for example by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher s acid chloride separating the diastereomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.

The present invention also embraces isotopically labelled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus fluorine and chlorine such as H H C C N O O P P S F and Cl respectively.

Certain isotopically labeled compounds of Formula I e.g. those labeled with H and C are useful in compound and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability e.g. increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and or in the Examples hereinbelow by substituting an appropriate isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

Polymorphic forms of the compounds of Formula I and of the salts solvates esters and prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I are intended to be included in the present invention.

The term pharmaceutical composition is also intended to encompass both the bulk composition and individual dosage units comprised of more than one e.g. two pharmaceutically active agents such as for example a compound of the present invention and an additional agent selected from the lists of the additional agents described herein along with any pharmaceutically inactive excipients. The bulk composition and each individual dosage unit can contain fixed amounts of the afore said more than one pharmaceutically active agents . The bulk composition is material that has not yet been formed into individual dosage units. An illustrative dosage unit is an oral dosage unit such as tablets pills and the like. Similarly the herein described method of treating a patient by administering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is also intended to encompass the administration of the afore said bulk composition and individual dosage units.

The compounds of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates or esters thereof according to the invention have pharmacological properties in particular the compounds of Formula I can be nicotinic acid receptor agonists.

The compounds of Formula I of the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates or esters thereof are useful in treating diseases or conditions including dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome.

The compounds of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates or esters thereof can be administered in any suitable form e.g. alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier excipient or diluent in a pharmaceutical composition according to standard pharmaceutical practice. The compounds of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates or esters thereof can be administered orally or parenterally including intravenous intramuscular interperitoneal subcutaneous rectal or topical routes of administration.

or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt solvate ester or tautomer thereof can be in a form suitable for oral administration e.g. as tablets troches capsules lozenges aqueous or oily suspensions dispersible powders or granules emulsions syrups or elixirs. Oral compositions may be prepared by any conventional pharmaceutical method and may also contain sweetening agents flavoring agents coloring agents and preserving agents.

The amount of compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt solvate ester or tautomer thereof administered to a patient can be determined by a physician based on the age weight and response of the patient as well as by the severity of the condition treated. For example the amount of compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt solvate ester or tautomer thereof administered to the patient can range from about 0.1 mg kg body weight per day to about 60 mg kg d preferably about 0.5 mg kg d to about 40 mg kg d.

The compounds of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates or esters thereof can also be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents. For example one or more compounds of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates or esters thereof can be administered with one or more additional active ingredients selected from the group consisting of hydroxy substituted azetidinone compounds substituted lactam compounds HMG CoA reductase inhibitor compounds HMG CoA synthetase inhibitors squalene synthesis inhibitors squalene epoxidase inhibitors sterol biosynthesis inhibitors nicotinic acid derivatives bile acid sequestrants inorganic cholesterol sequestrants AcylCoA Cholesterol O acyltransferase inhibitors cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors fish oils containing Omega 3 fatty acids natural water soluble fibers plant stanols and or fatty acid esters of plant stanols anti oxidants PPAR agonists PPAR agonists FXR receptor modulators LXR receptor agonists lipoprotein synthesis inhibitors renin angiotensin inhibitors microsomal triglyceride transport protein inhibitors bile acid reabsorption inhibitors PPAR agonists triglyceride synthesis inhibitors squalene epoxidase inhibitors low density lipoprotein receptor inducers or activators platelet aggregation inhibitors 5 LO or FLAP inhibitors PPAR partial agonists niacin or niacin receptor agonists 5HT transporter inhibitors NE transporter inhibitors CBantagonists inverse agonists ghrelin antagonists Hantagonists inverse agonists MCH1R antagonists MCH2R agonists antagonists NPY1 antagonists NPY5 antagonists NPY2 agonists NPY4 agonists mGluR5 antagonists leptins leptin agonists modulators leptin derivatives opioid antagonists orexin receptor antagonists BRS3 agonists CCK A agonists CNTF CNTF derivatives CNTF agonists modulators 5HT2c agonists Mc4r agonists monoamine reuptake inhibitors serotonin reuptake inhibitors GLP 1 agonists phentermine topiramate phytopharm compound 57 ghrelin antibodies Mc3r agonists ACC inhibitors 3 agonists DGAT1 inhibitors DGAT2 inhibitors FAS inhibitors PDE inhibitors thyroid hormone agonists UCP 1 activators UCP 2 activators UCP 3 activators acyl estrogens glucocorticoid agonists antagonists 11 HSD 1 inhibitors SCD 1 inhibitors lipase inhibitors fatty acid transporter inhibitors dicarboxylate transporter inhibitors glucose transporter inhibitors phosphate transporter inhibitors anti diabetic agents anti hypertensive agents anti dyslipidemic agents DP receptor antagonists apolipoprotein B secretion microsomal triglyceride transfer protein apo B MTP inhibitors sympathomimetic agonists dopamine agonists melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor analogs melanin concentrating hormone antagonists leptons galanin receptor antagonists bombesin agonists neuropeptide Y antagonists thyromimetic agents dehydroepiandrosterone analogs of dehydroepiandrosterone urocortin binding protein antagonists glucagons like peptide 1 receptor agonists human agouti related proteins AGRP neuromedin U receptor agonists noradrenergic anorectic agents appetite suppressants hormone sensitive lipase antagonists MSH receptor analogs glucosidase inhibitors apo A1 milano reverse cholesterol transport inhibitors fatty acid binding protein inhibitors FABP and fatty acid transporter protein inhibitors FATP .

Compounds 153 285 were prepared using the various methods set forth above in the Examples section and substituting appropriate starting materials reagents and reactants. Mass spectrometry data for these compounds is presented below 

The nicotinic acid receptor agonist activity of compounds 1 285 was determined by following the inhibition of forskolin stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells using the MesoScale Discovery cAMP detection kit following the manufacturer s protocol. Briefly Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells expressing recombinant human nicotinic acid receptor NAR were harvested enzymatically washed 1 in phosphate buffered saline PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5 mM IBMX at 3 10cells mL. Ten L of cell suspension was added to each well of a 384 well plate which contained 10 L of test compounds. Test compounds were diluted with PBS containing 6 M of forskolin. Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature after the addition of cells. Lysis buffer containing cAMP Tag was added to each well 10 L well as per the manufacturer s protocol. Plates were then incubated from 45 minutes to overnight. Prior to reading 10 L of read buffer was added to each well and the plate was read in a Sector 6000 plate imager. The signal was converted to cAMP concentration using a standard curve run on each plate. Compound ECvalues were determined from concentration gradients of test compounds.

Compounds of Formula I of the present invention and salts solvates or esters thereof have cAMP ECvalues of less than about 10 000 nM preferably about 1000 nM or less more preferably about 500 nM or less even more preferably about 100 nM or less.

Using this assay it was determined that compounds 1 285 all have cAMP ECvalues of 1000 nM or less except for Compounds 40 55 65 129 130 131 238 246 248 258 262 and 278 282 which have cAMP ECvalues greater than 1000 nM. Accordingly the compounds of formula I can act as agonists of the nicotinic acid receptor.
