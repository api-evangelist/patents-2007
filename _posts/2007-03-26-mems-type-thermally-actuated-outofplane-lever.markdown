title: MEMS type thermally actuated out-of-plane lever
abstract: A MEMS apparatus includes a substrate; electrical contacts disposed on the substrate; a thermal arch beam supported by and connected between the contacts, the thermal arch beam including a midpoint and a protrusion located at about the midpoint; a lever having an axis of rotation and a bearing surface upon which the protrusion is operable to bear, a pair of lever supports disposed on the substrate for rotatably supporting the lever about the axis of rotation, an area of contact between the protrusion and the bearing surface being positioned vertically between the axis of rotation and the plane of the substrate. A voltage difference between the electrical contacts causes the thermal arch beam to move horizontally in the plane and the protrusion to bear against the lever causing rotation of the lever out of the plane.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties thereof.

The invention relates in general to microelectromechanical MEMS devices and in particular to MEMS devices that provide deflection out of the plane of the MEMS substrate.

Conventional systems for guiding missiles or projectiles in flight use canards or small wing like structures to steer the projectile. These structures are large approximately 3 in length and require motors to actuate. The stabilizing fins on the projectile have to be increased in size to counteract the effect the canards have of moving the center of pressure forward.

A MEMS control surface can reduce drag and hence increase the range of projectiles by eliminating the drag associated with canards and reducing the drag of the fins. In addition MEMS control surfaces may reduce volume weight and power requirements further increasing the projectile s range. Another added benefit of the MEMS control surface is the reduction of cost associated with batch fabrication techniques.

Known MEMS devices for producing a mechanical deflection include various types of thermally actuated beams including cantilever and arch beams. These beams have proven successful in producing a deflection in the plane of the MEMS substrate. Devices such as projectile control surfaces however require a deflection out of the plane of the MEMS substrate that is in a direction perpendicular to the MEMS substrate.

One MEMS type apparatus that provides out of plane deflection is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5 824 910 issued on Oct. 20 1998 and entitled Miniature Hydrostat Fabricated Using Multiple Microelectromechanical Processes. Another MEMS type apparatus that provides out of plane deflection is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 069 392 issued on May 30 2000 and entitled Microbellows Apparatus. These two U.S. patents are expressly incorporated by reference. A third MEMS type apparatus that provides out of plane deflection is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 474 593 issued on Nov. 5 2002 and entitled Guided Bullet. 

The vertical deflection of a single diaphragm apparatus like the hydrostat mentioned above is limited by the diameter of the diaphragm and its thickness. A micro bellows apparatus is able to deliver much greater vertical deflections for a similar sized device. However the deflections required to make an effective control surface are many times greater than a micro bellows alone can provide. The electrostatically actuated curved beam shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 474 593 cannot withstand high speed flow forces. A suitable control surface can be realized by combining a thermal arch beam apparatus with a lever that is rotatable out of plane.

It is an aspect of the invention to provide a MEMS apparatus that can provide vertical deflection out of the plane of the MEMS substrate.

It is another aspect of the invention to provide a MEMS apparatus that can provide vertical deflections larger than known MEMS apparatus.

Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide a MEMS apparatus that is operable as a control surface for high speed projectiles

One aspect of the invention is a MEMS apparatus including a substrate defining a plane a pair of electrical contacts disposed on the substrate a thermal arch beam supported by and connected between the contacts the thermal arch beam including a midpoint and a protrusion located at about the midpoint a lever having an axis of rotation and a bearing surface upon which the protrusion is operable to bear and a pair of lever supports disposed on the substrate for rotatably supporting the lever about the axis of rotation an area of contact between the protrusion and the bearing surface being positioned vertically between the axis of rotation and the plane of the substrate where a voltage difference between the pair of electrical contacts causes the thermal arch beam to move horizontally in the plane and the protrusion to bear against the lever causing rotation of the lever out of the plane. In an alternative embodiment the lever further includes an opening formed in one end for receiving the protrusion of the thermal arch beam.

An embodiment of the MEMS apparatus includes openings in each of the pair of lever supports a through hole in the lever and an axle disposed in the through hole and the openings in the lever supports the axle being free to rotate with respect to the lever and the lever supports.

One application of the invention is as a micro control surface to steer high speed projectiles. The invention is command actuated to create lift on a projectile body or fin. The device offers the advantage of simple electrical actuation.

A pair of lever supports are disposed on the substrate for rotatably supporting the lever around an axis of rotation R R . When beam deflects in the X direction due to the voltage difference between contacts the beam protrusion pushes against the bearing surface of lever causing rotation of the lever in the Z direction out of the XY plane. The area of contact between the protrusion and the bearing surface is positioned vertically between the axis of rotation R R and the plane of the substrate as shown in .

Of course other means may be used to rotatably support the lever . For example the axle may be fixed to or integral with the lever and rotatable with respect to the lever supports . Or the axle may be fixed to or integral with the lever supports and rotatable with respect to the lever . Or axle may be fixed to or integral with both lever and lever supports . In that case the portions of the axle extending between the lever and the lever supports include torsion beams or torsion springs that twist when lever rotates.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
