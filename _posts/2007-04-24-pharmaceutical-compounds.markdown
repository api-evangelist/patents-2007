The invention claimed herein was made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement between Piramed Limited and Genentech Inc.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 795 048 that was filed on 26 Apr. 2006. The entire content of this provisional application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to pyrimidine derivatives and their use as inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase PI3K .

Phosphatidylinositol hereinafter abbreviated as PI is one of a number of phospholipids found in cell membranes. In recent years it has become clear that PI plays an important role in intracellular signal transduction. In the late 1980s a PI3 kinase PI3K was found to be an enzyme which phosphorylates the 3 position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol D. Whitman et al 1988 Nature 332 664 .

PI3K was originally considered to be a single enzyme but it has now been clarified that a plurality of subtypes are present in PI3K. Each subtype has its own mechanism for regulating activity. Three major classes of PI3Ks have been identified on the basis of their in vitro substrate specificity B. Vanhaesebroeck 1997 Trend in Biol. Sci 22 267 . Substrates for class I PI3Ks are PI PI 4 phosphate PI4P and PI 4 5 biphosphate PI 4 5 P2 . Class I PI3Ks are further divided into two groups class Ia and class Ib in terms of their activation mechanism. Class Ia PI3Ks include PI3K p110 p110 and p110 subtypes which transmit signals from tyrosine kinase coupled receptors. Class Ib PI3K includes a p110 subtype activated by a G protein coupled receptor. PI and PI 4 P are known as substrates for class II PI3Ks. Class II PI3Ks include PI3K C2 C2 and C2 subtypes which are characterized by containing C2 domains at the C terminus. The substrate for class III PI3Ks is PI only.

In the PI3K subtypes the class Ia subtype has been most extensively investigated to date. The three subtypes of class Ia are heterodimers of a catalytic 110 kDa subunit and regulatory subunits of 85 kDa or 55 kDa. The regulatory subunits contain SH2 domains and bind to tyrosine residues phosphorylated by growth factor receptors with a tyrosine kinase activity or oncogene products thereby inducing the PI3K activity of the p110 catalytic subunit which phosphorylates its lipid substrate. Thus the class Ia subtypes are considered to be associated with cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.

There continues to be a need for class I PI3 kinase inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The PI3 kinase Akt PTEN pathway is thus an attractive target for cancer drug development since such agents would be expected to inhibit proliferation reverse the repression of apoptosis and surmount resistance to cytotoxic agents in cancer cells. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been reported Yaguchi et al 2006 Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 98 8 545 556 U.S. Pat. No. 6 608 056 U.S. Pat. No. 6 608 053 U.S. Pat. No. 6 838 457 U.S. Pat. No. 6 770 641 U.S. Pat. No. 6 653 320 U.S. Pat. No. 6 403 588 WO 2004017950 US 2004092561 WO 2004007491 WO 2004006916 WO 2003037886 US 2003149074 WO 2003035618 WO 2003034997 US 2003158212 EP 1417976 US 2004053946 JP 2001247477 JP 08175990 JP 08176070 . Wortmannin analogs have PI3 kinase activity in mammals U.S. Pat. No. 6 703 414 WO 97 15658 .

It has now been found that a novel class of fused pyrimidine compounds are effective inhibitors of PI3K with drug like physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. The compounds exhibit selectivity for class Ia PI3Ks over class Ib in particular for the p110 subtype.

The term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

The term stereoisomers refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and l or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

Furthermore a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and or one or more counter ion.

If the compound of the invention is a base the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art for example treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid methanesulfonic acid phosphoric acid and the like or with an organic acid such as acetic acid maleic acid succinic acid mandelic acid fumaric acid malonic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid glycolic acid salicylic acid a pyranosidyl acid such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid an alpha hydroxy acid such as citric acid or tartaric acid an amino acid such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid an aromatic acid such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid a sulfonic acid such as p toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid or the like.

If the compound of the invention is an acid the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method for example treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base such as an amine primary secondary or tertiary an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or the like. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include but are not limited to organic salts derived from amino acids such as glycine and arginine ammonia primary secondary and tertiary amines and cyclic amines such as piperidine morpholine and piperazine and inorganic salts derived from sodium calcium potassium magnesium manganese iron copper zinc aluminum and lithium.

Typically the salt is a mesylate a hydrochloride a phosphate a benzenesulphonate or a sulphate. Most typically the salt is a mesylate or a hydrochloride.

The salts for instance salts with any of the inorganic or organic acids mentioned above may be mono salts or bis salts. Thus for example the mesylate salt may be the mono mesylate or the bis mesylate.

A fused pyrimidine of the invention and its salts may exist as a solvate or a hydrate. A solvate refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention.

Certain exemplary compounds of the invention had PI3K binding activity ICvalues less than 50 uM.

The compounds of the present invention may inhibit p110 catalytic subunit isoforms including alpha beta gamma and delta as pan inhibitors. Certain compounds of the invention may be p110 isoform selective inhibitors by selectively inhibiting one of one of the p110 isoforms alpha beta gamma or delta. A p110 selective inhibitor may mitigate the risk of toxicity due to potential toxicities associated with inhibiting the other p110 isoforms. Certain compounds of the invention may be p110 isoform pan inhibitors by possessing significant binding to two or more of the p110 isoforms.

Binding of compounds of the invention from above Tables 1a and 1b to purified preparations of p110 isoforms alpha beta delta and gamma was measured by a Scintillation Proximity Assay SPA to determine binding activity IC Mol and selectivity of binding of beta delta and gamma isoforms relative to alpha Example 8 . These values are expressed in Table 2.

The compounds are typically selective for class Ia kinases over class Ib and typically exhibit a 20 fold selectivity for class Ia over class Ib PI3 kinases. In particular the compounds are selective for the p110alpha isoform.

Accordingly a compound of the present invention can be used to treat a disease or disorder arising from abnormal cell growth function or behaviour. Such abnormal cell growth function or behaviour is typically associated with PI3 kinase. Examples of such diseases and disorders are discussed by Drees et al in Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 2004 14 5 703 732. These include cancer immune disorders cardiovascular disease viral infection inflammation metabolism endocrine disorders and neurological disorders. Examples of metabolism endocrine disorders include diabetes and obesity.

Compounds of the invention prepared as described in the preceding Examples were submitted to the following series of biological assays 

Compound inhibition of PI3K was determined in a radiometric assay using purified recombinant enzyme and ATP at a concentration of 1 uM. All compounds were serially diluted in 100 DMSO. The kinase reaction was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and the reaction was terminated by the addition of PBS. ICvalues were subsequently determined using sigmoidal dose response curve fit variable slope . All of the compounds tested had an ICagainst PI3K of 50 uM or less.

Cells were seeded at optimal density in a 96 well plate and incubated for 4 days in the presence of test compound. Alamar Blue was subsequently added to the assay medium and cells were incubated for 6 hours before reading at 544 nm excitation 590 nm emission. ECvalues were calculated using a sigmoidal dose response curve fit. All the compounds tested had an ECs of 50 uM or less in the range of cell lines utilized.

Caco 2 cells were seeded onto Millipore Multiscreen plates at 1 10cells cm and were cultured for 20 days. Assessment of compound permeability was subsequently conducted. The compounds were applied to the apical surface A of cell monolayers and compound permeation into the basolateral B compartment was measured. This was performed in the reverse direction B A to investigate active transport. A permeability coefficient value P for each compound a measure of the rate of permeation of the compound across the membrane was calculated. Compounds were grouped into low P 1.0 10cm s absorption potential based on comparison with control compounds with established human absorption.

For assessment of a compound s ability to undergo active efflux the ratio of basolateral B to apical A transport compared with A to B was determined. Values of B A A B 1.0 indicated the occurrence of active cellular efflux. All of the compounds tested through the Caco 2 permeability screen had Pvalues 1.0 10cm s. One compound assessed through the bidirectional assay PI540 had an B A A B asymmetry index of less than 1.0 indicating that the compound does not undergo active cellular efflux.

Suspensions of cryopreserved human hepatocytes were used. Incubations were performed at compound concentration of 1 mM or 3 M at a cell density of 0.5 10viable cells mL. The final DMSO concentration in the incubation was 0.25 . Control incubations were also performed in the absence of cells to reveal any non enzymatic degradation. Duplicate samples 50 L were removed from the incubation mixture at 0 5 10 20 40 and 60 minutes control sample at 60 minutes only and added to methanol containing internal standard 100 L to terminate the reaction. Tolbutamide 7 hydroxycoumarin and testosterone were used as control compounds. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatants at each time point pooled for analysis by LC MSMS. From a plot of ln peak area ratio parent compound peak area internal standard peak area against time intrinsic clearance CL was calculated as follows CL l min million cells V k where k is the elimination rate constant obtained from the gradient of ln concentration plotted against time V is a volume term derived from the incubation volume and is expressed as uL 10cells.

Compounds were classified with low CL 4.6 25.2 l min 10cells clearance. The majority of the tested compounds of the invention were determined to have low hepatocyte clearance.

Compounds of the invention were screened against five CYP450 targets 1A2 2C9 2C19 2D6 3A4 at 10 concentrations in duplicate with a top concentration of 100 uM being used. Standard inhibitors furafylline sulfaphenazole tranylcypromine quinidine ketoconazole were used as controls. Plates were read using a BMG LabTechnologies PolarStar in fluorescence mode. The majority of the tested compounds assessed in this assay displayed weak activity IC 5 uM against all isoforms of CYP450.

Freshly isolated human hepatocytes from a single donor were cultured for 48 hours prior to addition of test compound at three concentrations and were incubated for 72 hours. Probe substrates for CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 were added for 30 minutes and 1 hour before the end of the incubation. At 72 hours cells and media were removed and the extent of metabolism of each probe substrate quantified by LC MS MS. The experiment was controlled by using inducers of the individual P450s incubated at one concentration in triplicate. The compounds of the invention assessed in this assay showed negligible effects on induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Solutions of test compound 5 um 0.5 final DMSO concentration were prepared in buffer and 10 plasma v v in buffer . A 96 well HT dialysis plate was assembled so that each well was divided in two by a semi permeable cellulose membrane. The buffer solution was added to one side of the membrane and the plasma solution to the other side incubations were then conducted at 37 C. over 2 hours in triplicate. The cells were subsequently emptied and the solutions for each batch of compounds were combined into two groups plasma free and plasma containing then analysed by LC MSMS using two sets of calibration standards for plasma free 6 points and plasma containing solutions 7 points . The fraction unbound value for each compound was calculated highly protein bound compounds 90 bound had an Fu 0.1.

Compounds of the invention were evaluated for their ability to modulate rubidium efflux from HEK 294 cells stably expressing hERG potassium channels using established flux methodology. Cells were prepared in medium containing RbCl and were plated into 96 well plates and grown overnight to form monolayers. The efflux experiment was initiated by aspirating the media and washing each well with 3 100 L of pre incubation buffer containing low K at room temperature. Following the final aspiration 50 L of working stock 2 compound was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. 50 L of stimulation buffer containing high K was then added to each well giving the final test compound concentrations. Cell plates were then incubated at room temperature for a further 10 minutes. 80 L of supernatant from each well was then transferred to equivalent wells of a 96 well plate and analysed via atomic emission spectroscopy. Compounds were screened as 10pt duplicate ICcurves n 2 from a top concentration of 100 M.

The ability of representative compounds from Tables 1a and 1b to inhibit the lipid kinase activity of purified preparations of human PI3K isoforms alpha beta delta and gamma was determined by a radiometric scintillation proximity assay SPA GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences . Concentration dependent inhibition at 50 IC Mol was determined for all four isoforms alpha and fold potency over beta delta and gamma relative to alpha was calculated for a selection of compounds in Table 2. Each compound has a p110 alpha IC
