The present application relates to computer networking technologies and more specifically to using a network appliance for load balancing and monitoring of network services.

When load balancing among a number of services it may be desirable to distribute incoming requests to a service currently servicing the fewest number of connections. However as the number of services and connections per service increase identifying the service servicing the fewest connections may take more time to compute. This may have the undesirable effect of hampering load balancing performance and the time to respond to a request at exactly the times when the set of services is the largest and or busiest. Thus it may be a challenge for a load balancing appliance to efficiently identify the service currently servicing the fewest number of connections.

The present invention efficiently load balances a number of services by assigning decreasing the granularity of the method for finding the fewest connections as the number of connections to a service increases. That is the present invention recognizes that when load balancing according to fewest connections it may more important to distinguish between two services servicing 4 and 5 connections respectively than to distinguish between two services servicing 800 and 801 connections respectively.

In one aspect the present invention relates to methods for more efficiently load balancing services based on fewest connections by decreasing granularity of service selection as a number of fewest connections serviced by the services increases. In one embodiment a method includes establishing by a load balancing appliance a set of identifiers corresponding to a number of connections serviced by a service the set comprising a first plurality of identifiers each identifying a predetermined number of connections and a second plurality of identifiers each identifying a predetermined range of numbers of connections. The appliance assigns to each of a plurality of services servicing connections an identifier corresponding to the number of connections serviced by the service at least one of the identifiers selected from the second plurality of identifiers. The appliance receives a request for a service and determines the identifier corresponding to a fewest number of connections with at least one service assigned to the identifier. The appliance then forwards the request to a service identified by the determined identifier. In some embodiments the method may be performed by a switching load balancing component of an appliance.

In a second aspect the present invention relates to load balancing appliances for more efficiently load balancing services based on fewest connections by decreasing granularity of service selection as a number of fewest connections serviced by the services increases. In one embodiment an appliance includes a memory element which stores a set of identifiers corresponding to a number of connections serviced by a service the set comprising a first plurality of identifiers each identifying a predetermined number of connections and a second plurality of identifiers each identifying a predetermined range of numbers of connections a receiver which receives a request for a service a processor in communication with the receiver and the storage element which assigns to each of a plurality of services servicing connections an identifier corresponding to the number of connections serviced by the service at least one of the identifiers selected from the second plurality of identifiers and determines an identifier corresponding to the fewest number of connections with at least one service assigned to it and a transmitter in communication with the processor which forwards the request to a service identified by the determined identifier.

In other aspects the present invention relates to using the above methods with respect to any other load balancing metrics including active connections active transactions response time number of packets handled processor load and bandwidth.

A load table may use any data structure or structures to store the services within the table. In some embodiments a load table may comprise a fixed size one dimensional array. Each slot in the array may either store a null pointer if no services have the number of connections corresponding to that slot or a pointer to a linked list of services having the number of active connections indicated by the slot. In other embodiments a load table may comprise a two dimensional array. The appliance may establish any number of identifiers. In some embodiments the total number of identifiers may be fixed. For example the identifiers may correspond to rows of a fixed size table. The fixed size table may be any size including without limitation 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 and 4096 rows. In some embodiments the fixed size table may be a predetermined number of bytes.

In establishing the set of identifiers step the set may comprise a first plurality of identifiers each identifying a predetermined number of connections and a second plurality of identifiers each identifying a predetermined range of numbers of connections. An identifier may be any integer character byte sequence and or bit sequence used to designate a number or range of connections corresponding to a service. The first and second pluralities may be any size. For example a first plurality of identifiers might comprise eight identifiers as in corresponding to services with 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 active connections respectively. A second plurality of identifiers might comprise 4 identifiers corresponding to services with 8 9 10 11 12 13 and 14 15 connections respectively. In some embodiments the set of identifiers may comprise a third fourth fifth sixth or any other number of pluralities of identifiers each identifying different predetermined ranges of numbers of connections. To continue the previous example a third plurality of identifiers may comprise 4 identifiers corresponding to 16 19 20 23 24 27 and 28 31 connections respectively.

In some embodiments the identifiers and predetermined ranges may be apportioned so that a fixed size table can cover a wide range of potential numbers of active connections. The following table provides an example of how a set of 1024 identifiers or table indexes may be apportioned with different predetermined ranges to cover services having up to 8191 connections.

For example according to the above table index would be assigned to only services servicing 45 connections while index would be assigned to services having between 512 and 515 connections. Likewise index would be assigned to services having between 516 and 519 connections. By apportioning identifiers in the above manner a fixed size table having 1024 entries can be used in conjunction with maintaining the relative number of active connections of services having up to 8191 connections. A pointer to a linked list may be stored in each row of the table with each linked list containing the services corresponding to that row. Referring ahead to a portion of such a table is shown. In some embodiments tables such as the above may be hardcoded into an appliance. In other embodiments tables such as the above may be customizable by a user or administrator of an appliance.

The appliance assigns to each of a plurality of services servicing connections an identifier corresponding to the number of connections serviced by the service at least one of the identifiers selected from the second plurality of identifiers in any manner step . In some cases the appliance may assign identifiers to all of the services the appliance is serving as an intermediary for at once. For example upon startup the appliance may assign an identifier of 0 to all services. Or if this particular method of load balancing is started after the appliance has already begun servicing connections the appliance may iterate through one or more of the services to determine the number of connections serviced and assign identifiers accordingly. In other cases the appliance may assign identifiers to a service in response to the appliance detecting a change in the number of connections serviced by the service. For example upon the appliance forwarding a new connection request to a service the appliance may increment a record kept of the number of connections assigned to the service and then assign a corresponding identifier. This assigning of identifiers is discussed in greater detail with respect to .

The appliance may receive a request for a service from any source and in any manner step . The request may comprise any protocol or protocols including without limitation HTTP FTP SMTP ICA and RDP. The request may be received from any computing device including without limitation a client client agent server server agent or appliance. In some embodiments the appliance may receive a plurality of requests. In some embodiment the method described may be triggered in response to receiving a certain number of requests. For example an appliance may use a round robin method or other load balancing method for distributing requests until a certain threshold of requests active connections or rate of new requests is reached and then switch to the method described in .

An appliance may determine the identifier corresponding to a fewest number of connections with at least one service assigned to the identifier in any manner step . This step may comprise checking a variable in which a table index corresponding to the lowest table index having non null contents is kept. For example with reference to the appliance may maintain a variable which holds the identifier corresponding to a fewest number of connections with at least one service assigned to the identifier. In this case the variable would store 8 as row 8 contains pointers to services B and E and no index with fewer connections contains any services. In other embodiments a variable may be maintained which may contain a direct pointer to a service assigned to the current lowest identifier. Referring to the variable may store 639 as it is the lowest identifier which has at least one pointer to a service. A variable maintained to indicate the lowest index having at least one index may be maintained in any manner. In some embodiments the variable may be updated each time the number of connections serviced by a service is detected to change. In other embodiments the variable may be updated each time the index assigned to a given service changes. One method for maintaining such a variable will be described in detail in conjunction with .

The appliance then forwards the request to any service identified by the determined identifier step . In some embodiments the appliance may select the first service listed under the determined identifier. For example with respect to after determining that 8 was the lowest identifier having services the appliance may forward a request to service B as it is listed before service E which is also identified by 8. It should be noted that this method will not necessarily lead to distributing a received request to the service having the least number of connections. For example referring to an appliance may receive a request and determine that 639 is the lowest identifier having at least one service and the appliance may then forward the request to service B as the first service identified by 639. Since identifier 639 covers services having between 1020 connections and 1023 connections it is possible that service B has 1022 connections while service D has only 1020 connections. However this method gives an administrator an ability to adjust the granularity of the load balancing based on how wide the predetermined ranges are. The performance difference may be negligible between a service having 1022 connections and a service having 1020 connections and so the range of 4 is justified by the table space saved and the computational simplicity gained by grouping those numbers of connections together. Likewise the performance difference may be substantial between a service having 30 connections and a service having 31 connections and so the range of 1 at the lower numbers 1 511 may also be justified.

In some embodiments any allocation of ranges may be used in conjunction with a set of identifiers. In some embodiments there may be no identifiers which are assigned a single number of connections. For example the following table presents another example listing wherein all identifiers identify a range of at least four connections.

Referring now to a flow diagram of a method for assigning indexes to services based on load parameters and maintaining a pointer to the lowest index occupied by at least one service is shown. In brief overview the method includes determining a load parameter of a service has changed step . An updated load parameter is determined step and then an updated virtual index is calculated for the service based on the updated load parameter step . A table index is then computed using the virtual index step . If the table index for the service has changed step the service is moved to the new table index step and the variable maintaining the lowest occupied table index is updated if necessary step . If the table index for the service has not changed step and the load parameter has increased step the service is moved to the end of a queue within its current table index step .

Still referring to now in greater detail an appliance may load balance based on any load parameter of the services the appliance is providing access to. Examples of load parameters include without limitation number of connections number of active connections number of sessions number of clients current bandwidth usage last response time average response time processor load and number of packets transmitted over a given time period. The appliance may detect a load parameter of a service has changed step using any technique. In some embodiments the appliance may detect a load parameter has changed based on the appliance distributing a connection request to a service. In other embodiments the appliance may detect a load parameter has changed by analyzing the traffic flowing in and or out of a service in order to monitor parameters such as bandwidth or response time. In other embodiments a service may communicate with the appliance suing a signaling protocol to indicate a load parameter such as signaling to the appliance the services current processor load.

After determining a load parameter has changed the appliance may calculate an updated load parameter for the service step . In some embodiments this may comprise adding or subtracting a connection from a variable corresponding to the services previous number of connections or active connections. For example after distributing a request to a service the appliance may increment a variable corresponding to the number of connections serviced by the service. Likewise after detecting that a connection has ceased transmitting disconnected or gone idle the appliance may decrement the variable corresponding to the number of services serviced by the appliance. Or for example after determining a number of packets sent to and or from a service in the past second the appliance may then update a static or rolling average of packets second maintained over the last 20 seconds.

After calculating an updated load parameter an appliance may compute a virtual index based on the updated load parameter step . In one embodiment a virtual index may correspond to the number of connections field described with respect to . In another embodiment a virtual index may correspond to a weighted number of connections. For example a given service A may be weighted twice as high as another service B. If service A is servicing 10 connections service a may be assigned a virtual index of 5 10 2 . In this manner service A would receive twice as many connections as service B if B is assigned a weight of 1 before they would have the same virtual index. In another embodiment a virtual index may be incremented or decremented based on a relationship between a weight assigned to a service and a maximum possible weight. In this embodiment a service s virtual index may be incremented by MaxWeight weight each time the services load parameter e.g. number of connections increases by 1. In still other embodiments a virtual index may be computed based on any of the other load parameters described herein.

In the embodiment shown after calculating an updated virtual index step the appliance may compute a table index corresponding to the virtual index step . Although this is referred to here as a table index for ease of illustration in conjunction with the previous example it should be understood that the table index may correspond to any data structure and is not limited to tables. This computation of the table index may be done in accordance with the assignment of the identifiers such as in the two tables included above. For example for the table below an index may be computed from a virtual index by the formula index index block start virtual index virtual block start 1 block range

where index block start is the start value of the table index for the given block of indexes the virtual index is within a block being the set of table indexes having the same range .

In the embodiment shown after calculating the updated index step the appliance may determine whether the index for the service has changed step . For example even though a service may have added a connection if the service previously had 513 connections according to the above table the index for the service would not change. If the index has changed the appliance may move the pointer to the service from its current position to the new index step . The insertion and removal may be done in any manner. For example a policy may be set such that when a service moves to a new higher index it is always placed at the front of the queue. This may be warranted since services which have just moved up in index are likely to have fewer connections than other services already in the same index. Likewise if a service moves to a new lower index the service may be placed at the end of the queue of services in that index as it may be assumed it will have a higher number of connections that other services within the range.

In the embodiment shown after the appliance determines the index for the service has changed step the appliance may also check to see if the new index is lower than the previous lowest occupied index. If the new index is lower the appliance may update a variable storing the lowest occupied index accordingly.

If the index for the service did not change in response to the load parameter changing the appliance may determine whether the load parameter increased step . In response to an increase the appliance may move the service to the end of a queue within the service s current index step . In this manner the appliance may distribute requests to services within a given index in a round robin manner. For example as connection requests come in the appliance may distribute the request to the first service listed in the lowest occupied index. The appliance may then move that service to the end of the queue for that index assuming the additional connection did not cause the index for the service to change ensuring that it will not receive a subsequent connection request until each of the other services in the index have been distributed a connection request. This may allow requests to be relatively evenly distributed within indexes.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific preferred embodiments it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
