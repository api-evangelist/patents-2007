The wall portion comprises a leading edge, a trailing edge, an outer diameter end, and an inner diameter end. The cooling channel receives cooling air and extends through an interior of the wall portion between the inner diameter end and the outer diameter end. The impingement rib is positioned within the wall portion forward of the cooling channel and between the outer diameter end and the inner diameter end to define a peanut cavity. The impingement rib nozzles extend through the impingement rib for receiving cooling air from the cooling channel. The turbulators are positioned within the peanut cavity to locally influence the flow of the cooling air. The leading edge cooling holes discharge the cooling air from the peanut cavity to an exterior of the wall portion.

Gas turbine engines operate by passing a volume of high energy gases through a plurality of stages of vanes and blades each having an airfoil in order to drive turbines to produce rotational shaft power. The shaft power is used to turn a turbine for driving a compressor to provide air to a combustion process to generate the high energy gases. Additionally the shaft power is used to power a secondary turbine to for example drive a generator for producing electricity or to produce high momentum gases for producing thrust. In order to produce gases having sufficient energy to drive both the compressor and the secondary turbine it is necessary to combust the air at elevated temperatures and to compress the air to elevated pressures which again increases the temperature. Thus the vanes and blades are subjected to extremely high temperatures often times exceeding the melting point of the alloys comprising the airfoils. In particular the leading edges of the airfoils which impinge most directly with the heated gases are heated to the highest temperatures along the airfoil.

In order to maintain the airfoils at temperatures below their melting point it is necessary to among other things cool the airfoils with a supply of relatively cooler bypass air typically siphoned from the compressor. The bypass cooling air is directed into the blade or vane to provide both impingement and transpiration cooling of the airfoil. Specifically the bypass air is passed into the interior of the airfoil to remove heat from the alloy and subsequently discharged through cooling holes to pass over the outer surface of the airfoil to prevent the hot gases from contacting the vane or blade. Various cooling air patterns and systems have been developed to ensure sufficient cooling of the leading edges of blades and turbines.

Typically each airfoil includes a plurality of interior cooling channels that extend through the airfoil and receive the cooling air. Cooling holes are placed along the leading edge trailing edge pressure side and suction side of the airfoil to direct the interior cooling air out to the exterior surface of the airfoil. An impingement rib is often placed between the leading edge of the blade and the forward interior cooling channel producing what is known as a leading edge exhaust passage which is sometimes referred to as a peanut cavity due to its shape. The impingement rib accelerates the cooling air to a suitable velocity to permit the cooling air to exit the leading edge cooling holes and to increase heat transfer capacity of the cooling air. It is desirable to place the impingement rib close to the leading edge cooling holes to decrease the distance the cooling air must travel after exiting the impingement rib. Additionally the further the impingement rib is from the leading edge of the airfoil the greater the separation of the cooling air from the interior of the peanut cavity is thus reducing the effective impingement cooling of the cooling air. It is however increasingly difficult to manufacture both the leading edge cooling holes and the impingement rib the closer the impingement rib is to the leading edge cooling holes. Thus leading edge cooling design often results in a compromise in the positioning of the leading edge cooling holes and the impingement rib. Excessive leading edge heating can result in erosion of protective coatings or corrosion and spallation of the base alloy. There is therefore a need for improved leading edge airfoil cooling in vanes and blades of gas turbines.

The present invention is directed toward a turbine airfoil which comprises a wall portion a cooling channel an impingement rib a plurality of impingement rib nozzles a plurality of turbulators and a plurality of leading edge cooling holes. The wall portion comprises a leading edge a trailing edge an outer diameter end surface and an inner diameter end surface. The cooling channel receives cooling air and extends through an interior of the wall portion between the inner diameter end surface and the outer diameter end surface. The impingement rib is positioned within the wall portion forward of the cooling channel and between the outer diameter end surface and the inner diameter end surface to define a peanut cavity. The plurality of impingement rib nozzles extend through the impingement rib for receiving cooling air from the cooling channel. The plurality of turbulators are positioned within the peanut cavity to locally influence the flow of the cooling air. The leading edge cooling holes discharge the cooling air from the peanut cavity to an exterior of the wall portion.

In one embodiment of the invention stator comprises a high pressure turbine vane that is positioned downstream of a combustor section of a gas turbine engine to receive combustion gas . Airfoil comprises a thin walled structure that forms a hollow cavity having leading edge pressure side suction side and trailing edge . The outer diameter end of airfoil mates with shroud and the inner diameter end of airfoil mates with platform . Combustion gas approaches leading edge of stator after passing through for example a first stage rotor blade. Vane redirects the flow of gas such that after passing by trailing edge the incidence of air on the second stage rotor blade stage is optimized.

Due to the extremely elevated temperatures of combustion gas it is necessary to employ means for cooling stator . Stator includes cooling passages A B C and D which include openings in outer diameter shroud and inner diameter shroud and extend through airfoil . As such cooling air can be directed through vane to perform impingement cooling on the interior of airfoil before being supplied to other engine components or being passed out of the engine. Stator also includes leading edge LE cooling holes A B and C and gill holes to perform film cooling on the exterior of airfoil . LE cooling holes A and B and gill holes allow cooling air to escape near and at leading edge of airfoil to form a barrier of cooling air along pressure side and suction side of airfoil . Cooling air is transferred from cooling channel A to LE cooling holes A B and C and gill holes through a peanut cavity positioned at leading edge of airfoil . LE cooling holes A C and gill holes extend through airfoil and into the peanut cavity to allow cooling air to escape from the interior of stator vane . The peanut cavity includes trip strips or other turbulators such that the cooling air is more effectively and efficiently transferred from cooling channel A to the exterior of airfoil .

Airfoil includes cooling channels A D and partitions that form a cooling network within airfoil and strengthen airfoil to withstand the temperatures and forces sustained during operation of a gas turbine engine. Partitions also known as ribs or dividers extend from pressure side to suction side of airfoil to divide the interior of airfoil into cooling channels A D while also providing structural support to airfoil . For example cooling air enters cooling channels A through D from either the inner diameter or outer diameter end of airfoil . Cooling channels A D include openings at both the inner diameter end and outer diameter end of airfoil within shrouds and such that cooling air is able to freely pass through airfoil and transfer heat away. In other embodiments cooling channels A D may be configured in a serpentine configuration. The forward end of cooling channel A adjoins impingement rib which includes nozzles so that cooling air can be directed into peanut cavities A and B at the leading edge of airfoil .

Peanut cavities A and B are positioned within airfoil between leading edge and impingement rib and between outer diameter end cap and inner diameter end cap such that peanut cavities A and B comprise enclosed interior cooling chambers. Cooling air from cooling channel A has access to peanut cavities A and B through nozzles in impingement rib . Nozzles accelerate cooling air as it travels toward leading edge of airfoil . Due to the pressure differential produced during operation of the gas turbine engine between peanut cavities A and B and the exterior of stator vane cooling air is pushed out of LE cooling holes A B and C and gill holes . Due to outer diameter end cap and inner diameter end cap cooling air does not enter peanut cavity from the outer or inner diameter end of airfoil . Thus a crosscurrent is not produced and cooling air is allowed to travel generally straight to LE cooling holes A C from nozzles .

Gill holes act to pull cooling air closer to the interior wall of airfoil while traveling through peanut cavities A and B. In various embodiments angled trip strips act to slow down or accelerate cooling air as cooling air enters LE cooling holes A B and C. Divider separates peanut cavity into upper and lower peanut cavities A and B respectively such that the flow of cooling air can be independently controlled for each of the outer and inner diameter ends of airfoil . For example in peanut cavity A cooling holes A are directed toward the inner diameter end of airfoil while in peanut cavity B cooling holes A are directed toward the outer diameter end of airfoil . Additionally nozzles in impingement rib may be differently sized in peanut cavities A and B to produce different pressures within each cavity.

Cooling air enters peanut cavity A through nozzles which compress and expand cooling air as it passes through impingement rib . Since cooling air is only permitted to enter peanut cavity A through nozzles cooling air has a tendency to travel straight towards leading edge while dispersing out toward pressure side and suction side such that cooling air forms a generally cone shaped distribution from each nozzle within peanut cavity A. However peanut cavity A is generally rectilinear near impingement rib such that cooling air does not naturally flow into the aft portion of peanut cavity A next to impingement rib . As such cooling air generally forms a recirculating pattern in the corners of peanut cavity A near impingement rib reducing the capacity of cooling air to remove heat from airfoil . It is therefore generally desirable to place impingement rib close to leading edge . This permits cooling air to flow across a greater portion of the interior surface of peanut cavity A and prevents cooling air from impinging on leading edge at a reduced velocity both of which increase the impingement cooling effectiveness of cooling air . However because of manufacturing issues impingement rib must be maintained some distance away from leading edge which is further increased by the addition of gill holes .

Gill holes which are placed alongside the impingement rib in columns often referred to as gill rows allow cooling air to escape peanut cavity A directly to pressure side and suction side to perform transpiration cooling of airfoil . Gill holes are placed just forward of impingement rib and extend to the exterior of airfoil . Gill holes also influence the flow of cooling air across the interior surface of peanut cavity A. Because gill holes are placed near impingement rib gill holes have the beneficial effect of pulling cooling air into contact with the interior of peanut cavity A. Thus more of cooling air reaches the aft portions of peanut cavity A which eliminates recirculation patterns and increases the heat transfer capacity of cooling air . Gill holes however have the deleterious effect of pushing impingement rib further back from leading edge . For example airfoil is cast with impingement rib while LE cooling holes A B and C and gill holes are subsequently drilled into airfoil . Impingement rib must be placed a minimal axial length away from leading edge in order to provide additional surface area to accommodate drill tolerance requirements. Additionally gill holes also disrupt the flow of cooling air from impingement rib to LE cooling holes A B and C. Thus due to manufacturing concerns and the presence of gill holes it is difficult to optimize the velocity and trajectory of cooling air as it enters LE cooling holes A B and C thereby negatively affecting the impingement heat transfer coefficient of cooling air .

Due to the lack of available surface area within the peanut cavity conventional airfoil designs do not incorporate turbulation features such as trip strips within the peanut cavity. In such embodiments leading edge cooling of the airfoil is primarily obtained from the jet of cooling air exiting the nozzles in the impingement rib such that cooling of the suction side and pressure side of the leading edge portion of the airfoil is achieved by the dispersing of the cooling air as it exits the nozzles. Airfoil of the present invention is provided with turbulation features such as trip strips and gill holes along the interior wall of peanut cavity A to mitigate the reduction in internal peak and sidewall convective heat transfer coefficient due to the required distance impingement rib must be placed from leading edge to accommodate manufacture of vane . Specifically in one embodiment trip strips are used to tune the flow characteristics of cooling air as it enters LE cooling holes A B and C and to increase the heat transfer coefficient of cooling air as it passes along the interior wall of airfoil . In the embodiment shown peanut cavity A comprises two columns of trip strips one on pressure side and one on suction side . Trip strips begin at the forward side of impingement rib and wrap around toward the leading edge of airfoil . Trip strips converge at leading edge to direct cooling air into LE cooling holes A C.

Trip strips are angled to direct cooling air from the aft portion of peanut cavity A toward LE cooling holes A B and C. LE cooling holes A are placed near leading edge of airfoil between trip strips . LE cooling holes C are placed toward pressure side of leading edge cooling holes A within trip strips . LE cooling holes B are placed toward suction side of leading edge cooling holes A within trip strips . In other embodiments however the position of LE cooling holes A B and C may be non uniformly placed or placed in other positions. In the embodiment shown in trip strips are sloped up toward the outer diameter end of airfoil as they extend from impingement rib . LE cooling holes A B and C are sloped down toward the inner diameter end of airfoil as they extend from the interior of airfoil . As such the trajectory of cooling air must be redirected before entering LE cooling holes A and C thus slowing the speed at which cooling air enters LE cooling holes A B and C. The angle between trip strips and LE cooling holes A B and C can be adjusted based on design needs by adjusting the angle of trip strips the angle of LE cooling holes A C or both. Additionally the suction of LE cooling holes A B and C introduces a downward component into the velocity of cooling air which pulls cooling air transversely across trip strips to further slow it down. The slowing of cooling air increases the residence time of cooling air within peanut cavity A thereby increasing convective heat transfer from airfoil . This embodiment is readily applicable to cooling configurations in which pressure loss across LE cooling holes A B and C and leading edge backflow margin is not a concern. However in other embodiments the orientation of trip strips within peanut cavity can be altered to minimize internal pressure loss rather than to maximize internal convective heat transfer.

Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
