Client devices also may include at least one other client application that is configured to receive content from another computing device. The client application may include a capability to provide and receive textual content multimedia information or the like. The client application may further provide information that identifies itself including a type capability name or the like. In one embodiment client devices may uniquely identify themselves through any of a variety of mechanisms including a phone number Mobile Identification Number MIN an electronic serial number ESN network address or other device identifier. The information may also indicate a content format that the client device is enabled to employ. Such information may be provided in a message or the like sent to another computing device.

Client devices may also be configured to communicate a message such as through email Short Message Service SMS Multimedia Message Service MMS instant messaging IM Internet relay chat IRC Mardam Bey s IRC mIRC Jabber or the like between another computing device. However the present invention is not limited to these message protocols and virtually any other message protocol may be employed.

Client devices may further be configured to include a client application that enables the user to log into a user account that may be managed by another computing device such as content server MSS or the like. Such user account for example may be configured to enable the user to receive emails send receive IM messages SMS messages access selected web pages participate in a social networking activity provide messages that may include hyperlinks or attachments or the like. However managing of messages may also be performed without logging into the user account.

Thus a user of client devices may employ any of a variety of client applications to access content read articles read messages compose messages send messages or the like. In one embodiment a user of client devices may access a news article or other item of interest from for example content server . The user may then select to forward a message to another user of one of client devices about the accessed content article or the like.

In one embodiment client devices may enable a sharing area for sharing content with members of a social network and for playing the content. Client devices may enable playing a multimedia object. The multimedia object may be selected for sharing by the user. The selection may be received using an application programming interface API of an operating system an event trigger or the like. The selection may be received in the client application e.g. web browser in a plug in to the client application or the like. The multimedia object may then be sent to MSS over networks and or in preparation for sharing with members of a social network. MSS may provide a hyperlink to at least some types of the multimedia object on MSS . In one embodiment MSS may provide a hyperlink to a copy of the multimedia object on MSS . In any case a hyperlink or the actual multimedia object itself may be forwarded to at least one of client devices .

Moreover in one embodiment the forwarded message may include a reference to the content article or message using for example an attachment a hyperlink a copy of the content article or message within the forwarded message or virtually any other mechanism. The user may select to forward the message as a form of gossip or any other form of communication to members of a social network. It should be noted that the term gossip as used herein refers to a classification of content. However the invention is not limited to merely managing gossip messages and any content may be managed using the invention.

In one embodiment the message may be forwarded anonymously such that the recipients may not readily determine from whom the message is actually forwarded. This may be performed in a variety of ways. For example in one embodiment a header of the forwarded message indicating a source of the message may be blank may include an alias a fake identifier or the like.

When another user receives the forwarded message that recipient user may select to ignore the message read the message delete the message or forward the message to at least one other user of one of client devices . In one embodiment as the message is forwarded to other members in the social network a hop distance may be determined in real time. In one embodiment the hop distance may be determined by MSS and provided to each client device receiving and or forwarding the message. However the invention is not so limited and the hop distance may be determined using any of a variety of other mechanisms. For example in one embodiment one or more client devices receiving and or forwarding the message may determine the hop distance. This may be performed using a variety of ways including for example including with the message information about a number of hops the message traversed to reach a recipient sending an acknowledgement back through a chain of forwarding client devices where the acknowledgments may be used to determine the hop distance or any of a variety of other ways. Thus in one embodiment the hop distance may be determined using any of a variety of peer to peer approaches a server based approach or even a combination of peer to peer and server based approach.

In any event the hop distance may then be displayed at a client device in one embodiment along with the message to indicate a level of interest by the members of the social network. That is the more times the message is forwarded by different users in a sequence of users e.g. client devices the greater the determined hop distance. Thus a user may view the hop distance as an indicator of how interesting or news worthy the message may be.

In one embodiment to whom the message is to be forwarded may be determined automatically based on an address book buddy list or any other form of contact list associated with the user requesting the message to be forwarded. For example a user may employ a client application to indicate that a message is to be forwarded. When the indication is received by the client device or other network device the user s contact list may be examined to determine to whom to forward the message. Embodiments of an interface useable to display and otherwise manage messages using a sharing area and or player are described in more detail below in conjunction with .

MSS may further dynamically determine hop distances for respective messages enable rank ordering of messages for a client device and enable automatic deletion of a message based in part on hop distance. In one embodiment if a message is ignored by a message recipient for a defined time period the message may also be automatically deleted from a display of messages to the recipient.

MSS may in one embodiment provide to a client device a determined hop distance for display with a respective message. In one embodiment the hop distance may be configured to be dynamically updated in real time for the client device as the message is forwarded through a social network of users such as might be represented by client devices or the like. In one embodiment MSS might be configured to determine hop distance based on how a user of a client device responds to a received message. For example in one embodiment where a user receives a message and selects to forward the message to another client device the hop distance might be determined based on a longest sequence of client devices for which the message is forwarded. In one embodiment the hop distance displayed at a client device might be independent of whether the user forwarded the message or did not forward the message. That is in one embodiment the user might always see the hop distance to reflect the longest sequence even if that user is not within the longest sequence of users. In another embodiment if the user is not within the longest sequence the hop distance displayed for that user might reflect the length of the sequence of users for which that user is a member. However the displayed hop distance for a given user is not limited to these embodiments and any of a variety of other hop distances may be determined for display at a client device without limiting the scope of the invention.

As noted MSS may receive a selected multimedia object that was indicated for sharing. MSS may pre process the multimedia object for sharing.

In one embodiment the message may be displayed to the user in a rank ordering of messages based on message hop distances.

The operation of certain aspects of the invention will now be described with respect to . provides a logical flow diagram of certain aspects of the present invention. The process of may be implemented for example within client devices and or MSS of .

In one embodiment a user may select to have a sharing message sent to others. In one embodiment an interface may be provided to a user to enable the user to post or otherwise send the sharing message. One embodiment of such an interface is illustrated in . However other interfaces may also be used. The message may be one that the user received from another user or one that the user has composed. For example the user might have viewed something heard something or the like of interest and wants to share the information e.g. multimedia object .

In one embodiment the message may comprise several fields meta data or the like. The message may include a message body e.g. multimedia object a subject line lyrics genre artist or the like. The user might insert content into a message body including a link to an article other content modify the fields meta data or the like. The user may then select an icon or the like to request that the message be sent. In another embodiment the user might read a received message and select to have that received message forwarded. In one embodiment the user might modify the message by including additional information in an associated message body subject line or the like.

At block sharing over the network of the content between an originating sharing member and a plurality of members of a social network is enabled. In one embodiment the social network may include some or even all contacts in a contact list for a user originating the shared content i.e. an originating sharing member. In one embodiment the contact list may be the list of Instant Messaging IM users to which the originating sharing member has access. In one embodiment meta data associated with the shared content may also be sent. For example the author date time to live or the like may be sent with the shared content. In one embodiment the content may be stored on a server and or client device before being sent. In one embodiment a hyperlink to the stored content may be sent in the sharing message. In another embodiment the content may be sent within the sharing message.

A determination may be made to send either the hyperlink or the actual content e.g. multimedia object based on an ownership of the multimedia object a preference of a user forwarding the multimedia object a type of the multimedia object or the like. In one embodiment a user sending a multimedia object may not have permission to share the actual multimedia object based on for example digital rights management DRM rights. The user may send a hyperlink to the multimedia object. The receiver may play the multimedia object from the hyperlink if the receiver has permission.

In one embodiment the content may be shared a plurality of times beginning with the originating sharing member and or between a plurality of members of the social network. In an alternate embodiment at block instead of sharing a plurality of contents one at a time a plurality of contents may be shared collectively with each other e.g. within the same communication by the originating sharing member.

At block a hop distance for the shared content is determined. In one embodiment the hop distance may be determined in real time for the message. In one embodiment the hop distance may be determined based on a count of each request received to forward the message. Thus if the message was requested to be forwarded to the user by a previous user the hop distance might be initially at least one. When the present user requests that the message be forwarded independent of the number of potential recipients the message is to be forwarded to the updated hop distance would increase by one and so forth. In another embodiment the hop distance may be updated as the message is received by a recipient as the message is sent or any of a variety of timing points in the process of sending receiving the message. In one embodiment an update of the hop distance may be based in part on a number of client devices in a sequence of client devices for which the sharing message is forwarded beyond a client device receiving the sharing message from an originating sharing member wherein the update of the hop distance indicates an updated level of interest in the content. In one embodiment the hop distance may comprise at least two of a topological distance within the social network between members receiving the shared content a number of network hyperlinks between a plurality of client devices receiving the shared content a number of times the content is shared over the network or any combination thereof.

In addition an interface at the recipient s client device may be configured to display the message based on the hop distance. For example illustrates an example interface useable for managing a sharing content including a multimedia object. Shown in are message lists with a plurality of messages each message having an associated hop distance such as the hop distance and or combination relevance measure shown for item . In one embodiment the messages may be displayed in a rank ordering based on the hop distances and or combination relevance measures. In another embodiment the hop distances and or combination relevance measure may be displayed with the messages however in yet another embodiment the hop distance and or combination relevance measure may be hidden. In one embodiment determination and or use of the hop distance and or combination relevance measure may be optional.

At decision block it is determined whether the content is a multimedia object. If the content is determined as a multimedia object processing continues to block . Otherwise processing continues to block .

At block a relevance measure based for the multimedia object is retrieved. In one embodiment information identifying the multimedia object may be parsed from a hyperlink to the multimedia object determined based on meta data for the multimedia object a sampling of the multimedia object or the like. The information identifying the multimedia object may be a name of a track artist album record label genre or the like. In one embodiment the retrieved relevance measure may be based on the determined information identifying the multimedia object. In one embodiment the retrieved relevance measure may be based on a non hop distance measure including play and sales number e.g. volume of sale dollars of sales volume of downloads volume of online play a rate of change thereof a vote for a popularity e.g. may be an average of the vote or any combination thereof. Such non hop distance data may be determined for the name of the track artist album record label genre or the like for the multimedia object. For example a critic publisher artist or even consumers e.g. listeners or viewers of a multimedia object may rate the object based on voting on the popularity of the multimedia object e.g. using a star system a number system a thumbs up down system . The relevance measure may be retrieved from any source including a database a third party server service over a network or the like.

At block a combination of the relevance measure and a hop distance for the shared multimedia object is provided. In one embodiment the combination relevance measure may be based on a weighted sum of the hop distance and the relevance measure a product a logarithmic product inverse logarithmic product a combination based on a threshold a combination based on a percentage of a maximum hop distance or any other combination of the hop distance and the relevance measure. For example a shared song has a relevance measure of 3 stars and a hop distance of 10. The maximum hop distance for every shared content is 20. The new combination relevance measure may be computed by the function relevance measure maximum hop distance hop distance . For example the combination relevance measure may be 1.5 stars 3 10 20.

In one embodiment providing the combination relevance measure may comprise displaying the combination. In one embodiment the hop distance relevance measure and or a combination of the hop distance and relevance measure may be displayed co located with the shared multimedia object e.g. as simply a number a spreadsheet a chart a graph or the like. Referring to browser of the relevance measure may be displayed overlaid and in close proximity with the shared multimedia object and or information such as a hyperlink identifying the shared multimedia object within a web page. As shown combination relevance measure is overlaid and in close proximity with a hyperlink to a shared multimedia object and combination relevance measure is overlaid and in close proximity with a hyperlink to a shared multimedia object. Alternately the hop distance relevance measure and or a combination of the hop distance and relevance measure may be displayed in a sharing area for the shared multimedia object. Referring to sharing area of the combination may be displayed co located with the shared multimedia object and or information identifying the shared multimedia object. For example lists include a plurality of items. As shown item is a shared song with a co located hop distance 20 hops and a combination of a relevance measure and the hop distance. As shown the combination relevance measure is 2 stars for item . Also as shown the hop distance may also be displayed. In one embodiment the hop distance and or combination relevance measure may be configurable to be displayed or filtered based on the source of the information. Processing next continues to block .

At block the hop distance is displayed or otherwise provided. In one embodiment the hop distance may be displayed co located with the shared content e.g. as simply a number a spreadsheet a chart a graph or the like. In one embodiment if the shared content refers to a fragment of a web page e.g. text image object hyperlink or the like the actual content may be retrieved and displayed. For example if the shared content refers to an image the image may be retrieved e.g. using HTTP and displayed in a sharing area. In one embodiment the hop distance may be configurable to be displayed or filtered based on the source of the information. Processing next continues to block .

Processing flows next to decision block where a determination is made whether more message activity is to be managed. Such might arise for example as a message is forwarded through the social network new messages are created and sent or the like. If there is more activity processing loops back to block otherwise processing returns to a calling process to perform other actions.

While process describes sharing content of a plurality of types including multimedia objects in an alternate embodiment process may be adapted to share only multimedia objects. For example in one embodiment and may be optional and may not be performed. Blocks and may be adapted to share or otherwise process only multimedia objects.
