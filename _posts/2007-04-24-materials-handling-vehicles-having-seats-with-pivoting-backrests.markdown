title: Materials handling vehicles having seats with pivoting backrests
abstract: A compressive member is used to bias a seat backrest into a predetermined position, generally upright as illustrated, relative to a seat base with the compressive member deforming to enable the seat to be pivoted by the application of force to the backrest. When used on a materials handling vehicle for which it is particularly applicable, the resiliently biased backrest attenuates forces that are transferred to the back of an operator occupying the seat when the vehicle is driven over irregularities in a floor supporting the vehicle.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 794 342 filed Apr. 24 2006 and entitled MATERIALS HANDLING VEHICLES HAVING SEATS WITH PIVOTING BACKRESTS AND THE PIVOTING BACKREST SEATS which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates in general to seats for materials handling vehicles and more particularly to materials handling vehicle seats having pivoting seat backrests which improve the comfort of vehicle operators and also improve the operators views of elevated forks of the vehicles.

Pivoting backrests for office and dinette chairs are well known and include chairs having a variety of resilient members for enabling chair backrests to pivot relative to the chairs seating bases in response to force applied to the backrests. The resilient members also return the chairs backrests to neutral resting back supporting positions when forces required for pivoting are removed. Resilient members include flat spring members made of metal plastics composite materials and the like as well as pads made of elastomeric materials. The effective density of some elastomeric pads used in such chairs can be controlled by adjusting a compressive force with the amount of compressive force being used to control the amount of force required to effect movement of an associated chair member for example the tilt of a chair as shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 871 208 and 5 649 740.

Typical materials handling vehicle seats have fixed backrests that firmly support the operator during operation of the vehicles and operation of materials handling systems included on the vehicles. Unfortunately seats having fixed seat backrests can be uncomfortable for operators when materials handling vehicles are driven over irregularities or bumps common on surfaces over which the vehicles are driven and including for example dock boards joints entries to trucks and the like. When vehicles traverse such bumps the normally solid suspensions of the vehicles cause them to bounce and rotate so that seat backrests lurch forward striking operators in the back if the operators backs are close to or resting against the seat backrests. While existing seats are typically padded repeated seat backrest impacts create discomfort and can lead to early fatigue of vehicle operators. To alleviate this discomfort operators may assume postures leaning away from the backrests. While these postures reduce the force of seat backrest impacts they also may lead to early operator fatigue.

Accordingly there is a need for improved seats having pivoting backrests to attenuate the pounding action of conventional seats that occurs when a materials handling vehicle is driven over dock boards joints and similar vehicle support surface irregularities or bumps that bounce and rotate the vehicle and the operator s seat. Such seats and particularly their backrest pivoting mechanisms should be of simple structure to facilitate assembly reduce parts counts and reduce costs for the seats. Due to movement of operators within seats on materials handling vehicles during normal operation it is possible for an operator to inadvertently place an appendage near a pivoting mechanism. Accordingly it would be desirable to have a pivoting structure that itself protects operators from potential pinching points created by pivoting movement of the seat backrest. In the case of elastomeric pads used for seat pivoting it is also desirable to have protective structure to prevent pad damage over time which can otherwise be incurred by the application of force to a pivoting seat backrest that exceeds the force necessary to achieve a maximum pivot position.

In the invention of the present application a compressive member is used to bias a seat backrest into a predetermined position generally upright as illustrated relative to a seat base with the compressive member deforming to enable the seat backrest to be pivoted relative to the seat base by the application of an appropriate force to the backrest. When used on materials handling vehicles for which it is particularly applicable the resiliently biased backrest attenuates forces that are transferred to the backs of operators occupying the seats when the vehicles are driven over commonly occurring irregularities in surfaces on which the vehicles are driven.

In accordance with one aspect of the present invention a materials handling vehicle comprises a body having forks supported for movement relative to the body and a seat mounted to the body for receiving an operator of the materials handling vehicle. The seat comprises a seat base a seat backrest and seat backrest mounting structure engaging the seat base with the engagement of the backrest mounting structure and the seat base generally defining a seat backrest pivot axis. The seat backrest moves about the seat backrest pivot axis for pivoting movement relative to the seat base. A compressive member is associated with the structure and the seat backrest. The compressive member in a neutral configuration biases the seat backrest to a predetermined position from which the seat backrest pivots relative to the seat base upon application of force to the seat backrest sufficient to deform the compressive member from the neutral configuration.

In accordance with another aspect of the present invention a method for attenuating forces applied to the back of an operator of a materials handling vehicle when the vehicle travels over driving surfaces having irregularities comprises providing a seat base and a seat backrest that pivots relative to the seat base. The seat backrest is resiliently biased so that the seat backrest pivots to attenuate at least a portion of the force the seat backrest would otherwise exert against an operator s back when the materials handling vehicle is driven over driving surface irregularities.

Reference is made to which shows a materials handling vehicle illustrated as an electric fork lift truck having a body housing power equipment for driving the lift truck and associated materials handling systems on the truck . While the present invention is not limited to use on battery powered lift trucks as illustrated the body houses a battery not shown for supplying power to a traction motor not shown connected to a pair of front drive wheels only one shown in and to one or more hydraulic motors and pumps not shown supplying hydraulic fluid to several different systems such as mast and fork hydraulic cylinders not shown . The traction motor and the drive wheels define a drive mechanism for moving the truck . An operator s compartment in the body is provided with a steering wheel for controlling the direction of travel of the truck and control handles for controlling operations such as fork height tilt side shift and the like. The steering wheel is coupled via conventional apparatus to one or a pair of steerable rear wheels only one shown in .

A pair of forks are mounted on a fork carriage mechanism that includes a fork carriage not shown and a load backrest . The forks are coupled to the fork carriage which in turn is coupled to an extensible mast assembly . The load backrest is also coupled to the fork carriage. The mast assembly includes a fixed lower mast member and at least one nested movable mast member not shown . The lower mast member is fixedly coupled to the body while the most elevated movable mast member is coupled to the fork carriage. The fork carriage mechanism and the mast assembly together define a fork carrying assembly.

The mast assembly includes one or more hydraulic cylinders not shown for effecting vertical movement of the nested movable mast member s relative to the lower mast member . Further one or more hydraulic cylinders not shown are coupled to the body and the mast assembly for tilting all mast members toward and away from the truck about a substantially horizontal axis. Additional hydraulic apparatus not shown can be provided between the mast assembly and the carriage mechanism for moving the carriage mechanism and the forks from side to side. All of the foregoing is in accordance with known fork lift truck design.

As shown in a seat is mounted to a seat deck of the truck and comprises a seat base having a seat cushion mounted thereto and a seat backrest having a seat cushion mounted thereto. Referring to the seat cushions and shown in and other associated structures have been omitted for clarity of illustration. As illustrated seat backrest mounting structure comprises a seat backrest mounting plate that engages the seat base to generally define a seat backrest pivot axis A as will be described. The seat backrest can pivot relative to the seat base generally about the pivot axis A which is generally horizontal.

A compressive member is associated with the seat backrest mounting structure and the seat backrest . The compressive member in a first configuration which may be referred to as a neutral configuration even though some deformation of the compressive member is present due to preloading the compressive member biases the seat backrest to a predetermined position illustrated in as being generally upright. The compressive member is made of a resilient elastomeric material such as silicone rubber Santoprene thermoplastic elastomer TPE Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizate TPV or others that are commercially available from resin suppliers for injection molding or rubber like compounds for compression molding for example see Advanced Elastomer Systems at www.Santoprene.com.

It is currently believed that the compressive member should have a range of firmness from about 20 Shore A to about 90 Shore A per ISO 7619 and ASTM D 2240 and that the range of firmness will likely be from about 35 Shore A to about 55 Shore A per ISO 7619 and ASTM D 2240 so that in its neutral configuration the compressive member can maintain the seat backrest and the seat cushion structure in its generally upright position and also provide support for an operator s back when sitting normally in the seat . The preferred firmness of the compressive member will ultimately be determined based on operator comfort and the dynamic performance of the seat backrest and can vary based on given applications and preferences.

The spacing of the compressive member from the pivot axis A is selected according to the firmness of the member and the force required to compress the member for pivoting the seat backrest . Further the compressive force applied to the near side relative to the pivot axis A and the force applied to the far side relative to the pivot axis A of the compressive member tend to approach equality as the distance the compressive member is spaced from the pivot axis A increases. Accordingly the compressive member is spaced a sufficient distance from the pivot axis A so that excessive compression of one side of the compressive member is prevented. The current spacing of the midpoint of the compressive member from the pivot axis A is about 46 mm in one working embodiment wherein the compressive member has a firmness of about 55 Shore A .

If an operator applies force over and above a resting force to the seat backrest that is sufficient to deform the compressive member from its first or neutral configuration for example by leaning back against the seat backrest the seat backrest pivots relative to the seat base generally about the axis A. This pivoting of the seat backrest can provide an improved view for an operator when seated on the truck e.g. the operator s view of the forks of the lift truck when the forks are elevated may be improved as suggested by the operator view arrows shown at the upper portion of the operator s compartment in . Due to the resilient support of the seat backrest rotating or pitching motion of the truck caused for example by traveling over irregularities or bumps in a vehicle supporting surface can also result in sufficient force being applied to the seat backrest so that it is pivoted relative to the seat base .

In the illustrated embodiment the seat backrest mounting plate extends from the seat base to form a channel see between the plate and the seat base the compressive member being fitted within the channel and extending between the plate and the seat backrest which is also fitted within the channel . A backrest stop shown in and extends between the seat backrest and the plate to limit the deformation of the compressive member to protect the compressive member from damage due to excessive deformation which could otherwise be caused by the application of a strong force to the backrest .

In the illustrated embodiment the backrest stop extends from the seat backrest toward the plate however a backrest stop could also extend from the plate be located on the compressive member or otherwise be positioned between the seat backrest and the plate as will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the present description. In a working embodiment of the seat the pivoting motion of the seat backrest is limited to about 5.6 degrees however other pivot angles are contemplated for use with the present invention.

The seat backrest mounting structure illustrated in further comprises at least one fastener passing through the compressive member and also the seat base and the plate . This seat backrest mounting structure further comprises at least one sleeve which also passes through the compressive member and extends between the seat base and the plate . For this embodiment the length of the sleeve and the compressive member determine the preload on the compressive member when in its neutral configuration. Alternately the backrest mounting structure could be made to be adjustable to enable an operator to select the preload on the compressive member and hence the pivoting characteristics for the seat backrest . For example a screw or lever adjusting arrangement similar to those used in adjustable chairs could be incorporated into the backrest mounting structure .

As illustrated and currently preferred the seat backrest is not hinged or otherwise secured to the seat along its pivot axis A but only rests on the structure defining the pivot axis A. However the seat backrest is movably secured to the seat base and the backrest mounting plate by at least one fastener and at least one sleeve. While other fasteners can be used each fastener can be a bolt and a nut .

In the illustrated embodiment two bolts two sleeves and two nuts are used to movably secure the seat backrest to the seat base . The two bolts extend through the two sleeves which in turn extend through two openings in the backrest . The two openings through the backrest are elongated in a generally vertical direction as shown in to enable pivoting of the backrest generally about the pivot axis A relative to the seat base as the compressive member is deformed by pressure applied to the backrest .

The backrest mounting plate is formed in a general L shape or general J shape having its upwardly curved part truncated as shown in having an upper portion A and a lower portion B with the distal end D see of the lower portion B of the plate engaging the seat base to generally define the pivot axis A for the seat backrest . The distal end D of the lower portion B of the plate comprises at least one extension C illustrated in that engages a generally upward extending back portion A of the seat base and the lower end L of the seat backrest comprises at least one notch A illustrated in to receive the extension C so that the bottom edge of the seat backrest intermeshes with the extension or extensions on the distal end D of the lower portion B of the plate . Since the backrest mounting plate is bolted to the seat base the tab in slot interface defined by at least one extension C and at least one notch A maintains the pivot axis A and also prevents the seat backrest from pivoting forward i.e. toward the forks of the truck . The tab in slot interface also reduces the possibility of side to side movement or rotation of the seat backrest .

Operators normally move within seats on materials handling vehicles to view areas surrounding their vehicles so that they can properly perform tasks using the vehicles and also to vary their positions and thereby improve operator comfort. During such movements it is possible for an operator to inadvertently place an appendage near a pivoting mechanism for the seat backrest for example an operator s finger or hand could be placed near the seat backrest stop . To prevent an operator from being pinched by the backrest stop during pivoting movement of the seat backrest the compressive member and the seat backrest mounting plate are formed to prevent access to the backrest stop . Additional protection can also be afforded by the seat backrest itself.

The illustrated embodiment of the compressive member comprises a pair of cylindrical members A each having a bore extending generally through its center so that each is generally annular. The cylindrical members A are spaced from one another and illustrated as being interconnected by a separator B so that the backrest stop is at least partially enclosed by the cylindrical members A the separator B and the backrest mounting structure more particularly the mounting plate . As shown in the separator B comprises a rib narrower in width than the cylindrical members A that extends between the cylindrical members A over less than 50 of the cylindrical members A and across an upper portion of the cylindrical members A. The seat backrest rests on the structure defining the pivot axis A e.g. the notch A of the backrest that engages the extension C of the plate and is secured to the seat base by the fasteners that extend between the plate and the seat base . As illustrated the fasteners each comprise one of the bolts and one of the nuts with the bolts extending through the sleeves which extend between the plate and the seat base .

While it should be apparent from the foregoing description for sake of clarity a method for constructing a seat will now be briefly described. Initially the seat base is provided and a lower portion of seat backrest mounting structure the plate as illustrated is engaged with the seat base to form an engagement line which generally defines the seat backrest pivot axis A. As illustrated and currently preferred the seat backrest is not hinged or otherwise secured to the seat but is rested on the seat backrest pivot axis A so that the seat backrest can pivot relative to the seat base generally about the pivot axis A.

The compressive member is associated with the plate and the seat backrest with the compressive member being preloaded in a first configuration such that it biases the seat backrest in a predetermined position generally upright as illustrated wherefrom the seat backrest pivots relative to the seat base upon application of force to the seat backrest sufficient to deform the compressive member from its first configuration. In a working embodiment of the present invention the preload was set at about 12 of the total axial thickness AT of the compressive member e.g. the axial thickness AT of the cylindrical members A see . It is currently believed that the maximum deformation of the cylindrical members A of the compressive member should be limited to about 30 to ensure long life for the compressive member .

The plate extending from the seat base forms the channel between the plate and the seat base so that the association of the compressive member with the plate and the seat backrest comprises positioning the compressive member within the channel so that the compressive member extends between the plate and the seat backrest which is also positioned within the channel .

To limit deformation of the compressive member to a level which will not result in damage to the compressive member a backrest stop is positioned between the seat backrest and the plate . If the backrest stop is not provided and heavy force is repeatedly applied to the backrest the working life of the compressive member could be greatly reduced.

In accordance with another aspect of the present invention a method for attenuating forces applied to the back of an operator of the materials handling vehicle when the vehicle travels over driving surfaces having irregularities comprises providing the seat base with the seat backrest that pivots relative to the seat base . By resiliently biasing the seat backrest so that it pivots to attenuate at least a portion of the force the backrest would otherwise exert against an operator s back when the materials handling vehicle is driven over driving surface irregularities the operator s comfort is greatly enhanced. Resiliently biasing the seat backrest may comprise use of a compressive member associated with the seat backrest for example the compressive member which in a first or neutral configuration biases the seat backrest to a predetermined position wherefrom the seat backrest pivots relative to the seat base upon application of force to the backrest sufficient to deform the compressive member from its neutral configuration. It is believed that spacing the compressive member away from the pivot axis A of the seat backrest provides the most efficient operation and best life expectancy for the compressive member .

In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention as shown in and the seat backrest is interconnected to the seat base by seat backrest mounting structure comprising a pair of fasteners illustrated as bolts and nuts . Positioned between and resiliently separating the seat backrest and the generally upward extending back portion A of the seat base are a pair of compressive members shown as cylindrical or annular structures. In this embodiment the compressive members are not interconnected to one another and are preloaded dependent upon the length of the bolts and or any stop for limiting the extent the nuts can be threaded onto the bolts . The pivot axis A is generally defined by the base of the bolts adjacent to the non threaded bolt heads. As shown in by the broken line illustrations of the seat backrest in the seat backrest for this embodiment can pivot both backward and forward.
