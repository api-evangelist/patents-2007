This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10 2006 121318 filed on Dec. 4 2006 and No. 10 2007 67267 filed on Jul. 4 2007 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to an optimum resource allocation method and system in medium access control MAC of distribute scheme in a wireless personal network WPAN and more particularly to a method and system for optimizing resource allocation by determining the number of medium access slots MASs needed to prevent waste of wireless resources.

This work was supported by the IT R D program of MIC IITA 2006 S 071 01 Development of UWB Solution for High Speed Multimedia Transmission 

Wireless personal area network WPAN is a technology that enables wireless connectivity between devices such as audio video devices computers and peripheral devices within about 10 meters and supports communication between portable small sized multimedia devices with a lower power so as to support various services.

In medium access control MAC of WiMedia Alliance which is distributed MAC in the WPAN each of devices DEVs basically transmits its own beacon frame analyzes beacon frame information on neighboring devices to control basic timing between the neighboring devices and distributes quality of service QoS a hibernation mode and security in order to operate itself.

The MAC in the WPAN has a superframe structure. The superframe includes a beacon period BP and a data period DP . The BP includes beacon time slots BTSs in units of 85 s and the DP includes medium access slots MASs in units of 256 s.

Unlike a scheme in which network management is centralized by a specific device in the existing MAC network management is performed by each device so that network construction is easily performed in a wireless environment in which devices are frequently connected and disconnected. A network in which each device is connected to neighboring devices is illustrated in . Each device selects a BTS which is not used from among a number of BTSs and transmits its own beacon frame. The beacon frame of each device includes device DEV identifier ID BTS information about the device medium usage information and the like.

In addition the devices negotiate with each other to reserve MASs of the DPs by using information elements IE in the beacon frames in the BPs or command frames in the DPs so that competition and collision of transmitted data in the DPs can be prevented.

However the existing MAC has problems in that each device has to analyze a large amount of information on the neighboring devices and it takes much time to search for a point of compromise and this may cause waste of resources. Moreover if not all of the devices have mechanisms of optimally allocating necessary wireless resources the wireless resources in the entire wireless personal area network may be wasted severely.

An aspect of the present invention provides a method and system for optimizing resource allocation in distributed medium access control MAC in order to prevent waste of wireless resources in a wireless personal area network.

According to an aspect of the present invention there is provided an optimum resource allocation method in medium access control of distribute scheme in a wireless personal area network including calculating an overhead AckOverhead needed for an acknowledgement policy calculating an overhead MasOverhead generated per medium access slot by using the calculated overhead AckOverhead and an amount of medium access slots which remain after a frame is transmitted determining the number of medium access slots primarily needed per superframe by using the calculated overhead MasOverhead generated per the medium access slot and optimizing the number of medium access slots finally needed per superframe to allocate a resource.

According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided an optimum resource allocation system in medium access control of distribute scheme in a wireless personal area network including a medium access client layer including a plurality of medium access clients and determining and requesting a resource allocation scheme and an amount of resource in order to support a particular service a physical layer providing physical layer information including information on a reception state a link quality state and dynamic static parameters and a medium access control layer allocating an optimized resource in medium access control by using results obtained from information on the physical layer provided from the physical layer and functions of rate adaptation transmit power control interference control and transmit performance monitoring using information on the frame transmission state according to the request from the medium access control client layer wherein the medium access control layer primarily determines the number of medium access slots needed per superframe and optimizes the number of medium access slots finally needed per the superframe to allocate the resource.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements. In the description the detailed description of well known functions and structures may be omitted so as not to break the essentials of the present invention.

According to an embodiment of the present invention in order to optimize resource allocation in medium access control MAC of distribute scheme in a wireless personal area network WPAN the number of medium access slots MASs primarily needed per superframe is determined and the number of MASs finally needed per superframe is optimized.

Now a structure of a resource allocation system for optimizing MAC resource allocation in a WPAN according to the embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.

Referring to the resource allocation system in the WPAN includes a MAC client layer a MAC layer and a physical layer .

The MAC client layer includes MAC clients to and each of the MAC clients to determines an appropriate resource allocation scheme and an amount of resource in order to support and request a particular service from the MAC layer .

The MAC layer includes a MAC application programming interface API unit and a MAC resource management unit and has functions of interference control rate adaptation transmit power control transmit performance monitoring and the like. Here the MAC API unit optimally allocates a resource needed for the MAC resource management unit in consideration of the functions to using accepted information information provided from the physical layer and information on transmission states that are perceived in various manners. In addition the MAC layer determines a payload length of a transmission frame a data rate an acknowledgement policy an interframe space a preamble type and the like according to information supported by the physical layer and requirements of the MAC client layer .

The physical layer includes information such as a reception error a reception signal strength a link quality state a dynamic static parameter and the like.

Now a method of optimizing the MAC resource allocation performed by the resource allocation system having the aforementioned structure will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.

Referring to in operation the MAC layer defines parameters needed to determine the number of MASs primarily needed per superframe. Here the defined parameters may include a resource request allocation amount BW the number N of frame transmissions the number M of continuous MASs a data rate an acknowledgement policy AckPolicy an interframe transmission mode an overhead AckOverhead according to the acknowledgement policy AckPolicy an amount MasR of MASs that remain after transmitting a frame an overhead MasOverhead in a single or continuous MASs an amount BitPerSuperframe of data to be transmitted per superframe a time TimeForSuperframe to be allocated per superframe the optimized number OptimizationNumberOfMAS of MASs per superframe and the like.

In operation the MAC layer checks whether or not the acknowledgement policy AckPolicy is No ACK and the interframe transmission mode is a burst mode in order to calculate an overhead needed according to the acknowledgement policy AckPolicy and the interframe transmission mode. As a result of the checking when the acknowledgement policy AckPolicy is not the No ACK and the interframe transmission mode is not the burst mode the acknowledgement policy AckPolicy is Imm Ack and the interframe transmission mode is a normal burst mode. In operation the MAC layer calculates a value of the overhead AckOverhead according to a normal preamble type and operation is then performed. More specifically the MAC layer obtains the value of the overhead AckOverhead as 34 s by adding 14 s that is a preamble and physical layer convergence protocol PLCP header transmission time 14 s that is an Imm Ack frame reception time after a short interframe space SIFS to 10 s that is a time before a next frame transmission time.

On the other hand as a result of the checking in operation when the acknowledgement policy AckPolicy is the No ACK and the interframe transmission mode is the burst mode the MAC layer has to calculate the value of the overhead AckOverhead according to a preamble type. Therefore in operation the MAC layer checks whether or not a data rate is larger than 200 Mbps 200 Mbps

In operation the MAC layer transmits a single payload from a single MAS and calculates a remaining time MasR MasR 256 M AckOverhead .

Thereafter in operation the MAC layer checks whether or not another single payload can be transmitted within the calculated remaining time after transmitting the single payload Payload DataRate MasR namely there is a time to transmit another payload. When there is the remaining time to transmit another payload after the single payload is transmitted MasR

On the other hand when there is no remaining time in operation the MAC layer checks whether or not the N is 0. When the N is 0 N 0 MasR

Next in operation the MAC layer calculates the number of frame bits to be transmitted per superframe BitPerSuperframe BW SuperframePeriod 1000000 and in operation the MAC layer calculates a requested amount of resource to be allocated per superframe by dividing the calculated number of frame bits by the selected data rate TimeForSuperframe BitPerSuperframe DataRate .

Next in operation the MAC layer primarily calculates the maximum number of MASs needed to transmit only a payload by using the amount of resource to be allocated per the superframe FirstNumberOfMAS Max TimeForSuperfrmae 256 M MasOverhead . In operation the MAC layer secondarily calculates the number of MASs needed per the superframe in consideration of minimum continuous MASs needed to transmit a single payload SecondNumberOfMAS FirstNumberOfMAS M .

Next in operation the MAC layer optimizes the number of MASs needed per superframe calculated in the aforementioned operations.

The operations of optimizing the number of MASs needed per superframe will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.

Referring to in operation the MAC layer defines needed parameters. Here as the needed parameters the number Y of continuous MASs is defined as 1 the number P of Y continuous MASs is defined as 0 an overhead O of the Y continuous MASs is defined as 0 the sum OP of overhead of the Y continuous MASs is defined as 0 D 0 and the final number of MASs FinalNumberOfMAS is defined.

Next in operation the MAC layer allocates MASs needed per superframe in consideration of the number of continuous MASs calculated in operations illustrated in . For this the MAC layer uses two schemes. The one scheme is a row reservation scheme of allocating needed MASs to the same position of each of zones excluding beacon transmission zones MAS number of from 0 to 15 . Here 256 MASs included in the superframe are divided by 16 MASs and 15 zones are managed. The other scheme is a column reservation scheme of allocating needed MASs in order of zone or zone zone zone zone or zone zone zone zone zone zone zone zone or zone by perceiving allocation possibility from the zone excluding beacon transmission zones MAS number of from 0 to 15 . Next in operation the MAC layer calculates the total overhead by using the secondarily calculated number of MASs needed per the superframe SecondNumberOfMAS and the overhead MasOverhead generated per MAS as illustrated in .

Next in operation the MAC layer checks whether or not Y continuous MASs exist in MASs allocated from a single MAS and when the Y continuous MASs do not exist operation is then performed. On the other hand when the Y continuous MASs exist in operation values of the P and O are set and the sum OP of the overhead included in the Y continuous MASs are calculated by using the values OP O P OP .

The MAC layer increases the value of Y by 1 in order to search for the continuous MASs in operation and compares the value of Y with 16 that is the maximum value allocatable to each of zones excluding the beacon zone in operation . If the value of Y is smaller than 16 operation is performed and otherwise operation is performed. Accordingly in operation a difference between the calculated sum OP of overhead and the total overhead TotalOverhead is calculated TotalOverhead TotalOverhead OP . By using the value of the overhead reduced by the calculation the MAC layer converts the MAS into the minimum number of MASs and calculates the number D of unnecessary MASs by using the following Equation 1. FinalNumberOfMAS SecondNumberOfMAS Min TotalOverhead 256 D SecondNumberOfMAS SecondNumberOfMAS SecondNumberOfMAS FinalNumberOfMAS Equation 1 

In operation it is determined whether the value D calculated by Equation 1 is a negative or positive number. As a result of the determining when the value D is a positive number D 0 the MAC layer reduces the continuous MASs in operation and operation is performed in order to inspect suitability of re allocated MASs. Here when the MAC layer uses the row reservation scheme the MAC layer excludes the number of D from the MAS number by decreasing the MAS number in descending order of the MAS number by 1 in the zone having a large number of continuous MASs. When the MAC layer uses the column reservation scheme the MAC layer excludes the number of D from the MAS number by decreasing the MAS number by 1 in ascending order of the MAS number in the zone having a large number of continuous MASs.

As a result of the determining in operation when the value D is not a positive number it is determined whether or not the value D is 0 D 0 . When the value D is 0 the operation is terminated and when the value D is a negative number an absolute value of the D is additionally allocated to the number of needed MASs in operation . Thereafter operation is then performed in order to perform the resource allocation again.

Accordingly the number of MASs needed per superframe is optimized in the aforementioned operations and the resource allocation in the distributed MAC can be optimally performed. The embodiment is illustrated in . Here illustrates an example applying the row reservation scheme. Reference numerals to denote MASs canceled to be allocated according to the optimization operations illustrated in and the cancellation is performed in ascending order from to . illustrates an example applying the column reservation scheme. The cancellation is performed in ascending order from to .

Accordingly the MAC layer determines a payload length of a transmission frame a data rate an acknowledgement policy an interframe space a preamble type and the like by using information supported by the physical layer according to a request of the MAC client so that only a needed wireless resource is optimally allocated to each device in the WPAN. Therefore waste of the wireless resource in the WPAN is prevented and an efficiency of the resource can be improved.

While the present invention has been shown and described in connection with the exemplary embodiments it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
