The disclosure is related to seismic exploration for oil and gas and more particularly to processing and displaying data.

Seismic exploration for hydrocarbons is conducted using a source of seismic energy and receiving and recording the energy generated by the source using seismic detectors. On land the seismic energy source may be an explosive charge or another energy source having the capacity to impart impacts or mechanical vibrations at or near the earth s surface. Seismic waves generated by these sources travel into the earth s subsurface and are reflected back from strata boundaries and reach the surface of the earth at varying intervals of time depending on the distance traveled and the characteristics of the subsurface material traversed. The return waves are detected by the sensors and representations of the seismic waves as representative electrical signals are recorded for processing into images.

Normally signals from sensors located at varying distances from the source are added together during processing to produce stacked seismic traces. In marine seismic surveys the source of seismic energy is typically air guns. Marine seismic surveys typically employ a plurality of sources and or a plurality of streamer cables in which seismic sensors are mounted to gather three dimensional data.

The process of exploring for and exploiting subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs is often costly and inefficient because operators have imperfect information from geophysical and geological characteristics about reservoir locations. Furthermore a reservoir s characteristics may change as it is produced.

Geophysical and geological methods are used to determine well locations. Expensive exploration investment is often focused in the most promising areas using relatively slow methods such as reflection seismic data acquisition and processing. The acquired data are used for mapping potential hydrocarbon bearing areas within a survey area to optimize exploratory well locations and to minimize costly non productive wells.

The time from mineral discovery to production may be shortened if the total time required to evaluate and explore a survey area can be reduced by applying selected methods alone or in combination with other geophysical methods. Some methods may be used as a standalone decision tool for oil and gas development decisions when no other data is available.

Geophysical and geological methods are used to maximize production after reservoir discovery as well. Reservoirs are analyzed using time lapse surveys i.e. repeat applications of geophysical methods over time to understand reservoir changes during production.

Data acquisition for oil exploration may have a negative impact on the environment. The impact of oil exploration methods on the environment may be reduced by using low impact methods and or by narrowing the scope of methods requiring an active source including reflection seismic and electromagnetic surveying methods.

Various geophysical data acquisition methods have a relatively low impact on field survey areas. Low impact methods include gravity and magnetic surveys that maybe used to enrich or corroborate structural images and or integrate with other geophysical data such as reflection seismic data to delineate hydrocarbon bearing zones within promising formations and clarify ambiguities in lower quality data e.g. where geological or near surface conditions reduce the effectiveness of reflection seismic methods.

In one embodiment a method of locating subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs includes acquiring seismic data dividing the seismic data into time windows decomposing the seismic data to obtain a data spectrum selecting a first local amplitude minimum of the data spectrum and an adjacent local amplitude maximum multiplying the local amplitude value maximum by a function of the local amplitude minimum to obtain a frequency product and recording the frequency product in a form for display.

In another embodiment a method of processing seismic data includes decomposing seismic data to obtain a spectral component over a selected frequency range. For the spectral component a local amplitude maximum and a first adjacent local amplitude minimum are selected. The local amplitude value maximum is multiplied by a function of the first adjacent local amplitude minimum to obtain a frequency ratio pair and recorded in a form for display.

In another embodiment an information handling system for mapping an area associated with seismic data includes a processor configured to decompose seismic data to obtain a spectral component over a selected frequency range and is configured to multiply a local amplitude value maximum of the spectral component over a selected frequency range by a function of a first adjacent local amplitude minimum to obtain a frequency ratio pair.

In another embodiment a set of application program interfaces are embodied on a machine readable medium for execution by a processor in conjunction with an application program for processing seismic data. The interfaces include a first interface that receives frequency ratio data representative of a local amplitude value maximum of a spectral component of seismic data multiplied by a function of a first adjacent local amplitude minimum of the spectral component. A second interface receives the frequency ratio data to determine broad peak frequency location of frequency ratio pair data.

Information to enable the direct detection of hydrocarbon reservoirs may be extracted from naturally occurring seismic waves and vibrations measured at the earth s surface. These naturally occurring waves may be measured using passive seismic data acquisition methods. Peaks and troughs local minima and maxima in the spectral ratio at various frequencies may be used to form an indicator for the presence of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Local maxima and minima of relatively low frequencies 0 to 20 Hz in the seismic data spectral ratios may be used as an indicator for hydrocarbon reservoirs.

Low impact survey methods like passive seismic data acquisition may be used for reconnaissance in frontier exploration areas to monitor reservoirs over the productive life of a field or to cost effectively upgrade data room information to generate higher license bids. Specific applications for passive seismic data include monitoring fluid flow estimating shear wave velocities site zonation and shear wave amplification studies for earthquake hazard surveys monitoring hydraulic fracturing during reservoir stimulation and inversion for earth structure.

Passive seismic data acquisition methods rely on seismic energy from sources not directly associated with the data acquisition. In passive seismic monitoring there is no actively controlled and triggered source. Examples of sources recorded that may be recorded with passive seismic acquisition are microseisms e.g. rhythmically and persistently recurring low energy earth tremors microtremors and other ambient or localized seismic energy sources.

Microtremors are attributed to the background energy present in the earth that may be due to non seismic sources. Microtremor seismic waves may include sustained seismic signals within a limited frequency range. Microtremor signals like all seismic waves contain information affecting spectral signature characteristics due to the media or environment that the seismic waves traverse. These naturally occurring relatively low frequency background seismic waves sometimes termed noise or hum of the earth may be generated from a variety of sources some of which may be indeterminate.

Survey results from passive seismic surveying demonstrate that the spectral characteristics of microtremor seismic waves often contain relevant information for direct hydrocarbon detection. These frequencies are below the sound audible to humans and nominally include frequencies under 20 Hz.

Direct hydrocarbon reservoir indicators may be extracted using spectral analysis of microtremors. Microtremor analysis provides a method for identification and mapping of fluid reservoirs or reservoir related parameters directly from data acquired near the earth s surface in land and marine areas using naturally occurring seismic background waves. Collected over time these data highlight changes in reservoir parameters.

Microtremor analysis allows for direct determination of a hydrocarbon reservoir independent of the reservoir structure. Additionally the thickness of strata associated with a hydrocarbon reservoir may be determined or inferred from microtremor analysis.

One or more sensors are used to measure vertical and horizontal components of motion due to background seismic waves at multiple locations within a survey area. These components may be measured separately or in combination and may be recorded as signals representing displacement velocity and or acceleration.

The sensors may measure the components of motion simultaneously or asynchronously. As the spectra and the spectral ratios of the acquired signal for any location may be quite stable over time the components of motion do not need to be measured simultaneously. This may be especially applicable in areas with relatively low local ambient noise and for data acquired over relatively short time periods e.g. a few weeks . Spectra determined from asynchronous components at a location may be used as it is the relative difference of spectral components as opposed to specific contemporaneous differences that may be indicative of reservoir characteristics.

Geophysical survey local conditions may affect a method s results. In many cases the spectra based methods provide reliable direct hydrocarbon indicators in other cases a skilled operator can use the results to improve their interpretation of other geological and geophysical data and generate an improved subsurface model allowing for more efficient exploration and production decisions.

The sensor equipment for measuring seismic waves may be any type of seismometer. Seismometer equipment having a large dynamic range and enhanced sensitivity compared with other transducers may provide the best results e.g. multicomponent earthquake seismometers . A number of commercially available sensors utilizing different technologies may be used e.g. a balanced force feed back instrument or an electrochemical sensor. An instrument with high sensitivity at very low frequencies and good coupling with the earth enhances the efficacy of the method.

Ambient noise conditions representative of seismic waves that may have not traversed subsurface reservoirs can negatively affect the recorded data. Techniques for removing unwanted artifacts and artificial signals from the data such as cultural and industrial noise are important for applying this method successfully in areas where there is high ambient noise.

Embodiments of the present procedures have several advantages over conventional seismic data acquisition for exploration including that the techniques do not require an artificial seismic source such as an explosion mechanically generated vibration or electric current. Additionally the results from spectral analysis are repeatable and the results may be correlated to hydrocarbon accumulations. There is little or no environmental impact due to data acquisition. The method is applicable for land transition zones and marine areas. The method has application in areas where higher frequencies are greatly affected by geological conditions e.g. in areas where soft soil layers attenuate high frequency seismic signals or salt formations scatter higher frequencies.

The vector data may be divided into time windows for processing. Window lengths may be between half a minute and an hour. Alternatively window lengths may be greater than ten times the period of the lowest frequency of interest. For example if the frequency of interest has a period around 7 seconds all the windows may be at least 70 seconds long. However the length of time windows for analysis may be chosen to accommodate processing or operational concerns.

A data transform may be applied to decompose data into spectral components. Seismic data frequency content varies with time. Time frequency decomposition spectral decomposition of a seismic signal enables analysis and characterization of the signal time dependent frequency response due to subsurface materials and reservoir parameters.

Various data transformations or decompositions are useful for time frequency analysis of seismic signals such as continuous or discrete Fourier or wavelet transforms. Examples include without limitation the classic Fourier transform or one of the many continuous Wavelet transforms CWT or discreet Wavelet transforms. Examples of other transforms include Haar transforms Haademard transforms and wavelet transforms. The Morlet wavelet is an example of a wavelet transform that may be applied to seismic data. Wavelet transforms have the attractive property that the corresponding expansion may be differentiable term by term when the seismic trace is smooth. Additionally signal analysis filtering and suppressing unwanted signal artifacts may be carried out efficiently using transforms applied to the acquired data signals.

One or more orthogonal components of the acquired data may be merged for example the horizontal data components . Horizontal components Ve and Vn may be merged by any of several ways including a root mean square average so that horizontal component H may be defined as H square root over V V 2 . Whether merging data components is undertaken before or after a data transform is applied to the data is a matter of choice.

Additionally the spectra may be smoothed using a moving average . The smoothing parameter defines how many values to input for calculating an averaged value. A large smoothing parameter leads to strong smoothing and a small smoothing parameter leads to less smoothing. Examples of the number of values for a smoothing parameter may range between 10 and 500 but will be case dependent. A smoothing parameter for a flow may be selected at the beginning of a processing flow for application prior to calculating a spectral ratio.

A local maximum and at least one local minimum is selected based on the data frequency spectrum see . The horizontal component may be a combination of the measured horizontal components as in . These spectra may be averaged over time windows . Averaging over time windows may be by arithmetic mean or geometric mean. The frequency product values may be filtered or selected for inclusion into a map or display data set by whether the values are above a lower threshold and below a higher threshold see . The results after this processing may be output in a form for mapping or other display. Maps of this frequency product output for selected frequencies usually where values cluster together where peaks approach the higher threshold see in may provide direct indications of the geographical extent of hydrocarbon reservoirs in the field survey vicinity.

All the frequency ratio pairs f r may be plotted together to form an autonormalized survey spectrum as illustrated in . The autonormalized spectrum illustrated in is a combination of frequency products or ratio peaks frequency ratio pairs that naturally separate into broadening peak areas that may tend to separate into generalized zones. Where these values cluster may be termed broad peaks. A line on the chart represents a lower ratio threshold with a nearly random distribution of peaks the line. Typical values for this lower line will be survey dependent. Line in represents a higher ratio threshold above which values may be ignored recalculated or replaced. Values between these lower and higher selected thresholds particular the broad peaks may be analyzed and sorted depending on their broadening relative to neighboring frequencies on their frequency and other consideration related to data analysis correlation length duration etc. .

Area at approximately 1.6 Hz and at approximately 2.6 Hz of are examples of broad peaks. Once a broad peak is selected all or a subset of the points associated with the frequency and frequency product values f r maybe plotted on a map. Plotting and interpolating these amplitude values and their derivatives typically minima maxima averages and others produces a map that may illustrate trends associated with subsurface features or conditions.

As needed the data may be rotated to any desired reference frame. A reference frame where the vertical vector direction is normal to the geoid may be beneficial for subsequent processing. The spectra may be smoothed for example with a moving average function. The data may be decomposed into spectral components by Fourier or Wavelet transform.

Local maxima and minima are determined in the frequency spectrum . The frequency product for a frequency is determined using a local maximum and a local minimum . The frequency product values may be filtered or selected for inclusion into a map or display by whether the values are above a lower threshold and below a higher threshold. The frequency product is then stored in a form for display and or formed into a map. A map created with the frequency product in frequency ranges where the values peak near a selected higher threshold may give a direct indication of the geographical extent of subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs. Values between lower and higher selected thresholds may then be analyzed sorted and plotted depending on parameters as outlined above.

In an alternative embodiment passively acquired seismic data as input are divided into time windows a Fast Fourier Transform FFT or other transform is applied to each component orthogonal components are merged to obtain one component the data are be smoothed a spectral ratio is calculated and the spectra are averaged over discrete time ranges within time windows. The frequency data covers the frequency range of interest e.g. from 0 to 20 Hz by smoothed or equally spaced values. Example 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 . . . 19.9 20 values in Hz . This alternative embodiment may be combined with methods illustrated in and .

A normalised ratio is extracted for each selected peak as follows In a frequency interval defined below 20 Hz spectral peaks and their maximum amplitude VMaxas illustrated in are selected. Then VMaxis multiplied by a function of one or both adjacent local minimums VLand VR for example a multiplication by the inverse of the average of both values such as the function f n 2 VL VR . The frequency of the peak and the result of this multiplication VMax f n produce a pair f r that can be plotted in a 2D chart. These pairs form the autonormalised campaign spectrum and may be displayed for further analysis as illustrated in the example of . Additionally more than one maximum VMaxmay be combined together to calculate a ratio.

This autonormalised spectrum is a combination of peaks with various broadening that separate themselves above a so called lower ratio threshold e.g. of where values are nearly randomly distributed. Very high values above a so called higher ratio threshold e.g. of may be ignored recalculated or replaced by this threshold.

Peaks appearing between these two thresholds and can be analyzed sorted and or selected depending on their broadening on their frequency and on other processing considerations related to data analysis e.g. correlation length duration etc. . A cut off a higher ratio threshold may be applied or re adjusted after continued analysis. Once a broad peak in a spectrum is selected all associated points may be localised on a map and define a certain amplitude at a defined locations of the campaign. Plotting and interpolating these amplitudes or related functions of these amplitudes typically minimum maximum average produces a maps and related data. For example one map per selected peak over a survey or campaign area may be displayed.

So to summarize one embodiment a campaign spectrum is produced by combining the acquired data sorting into block of selected time periods applying a transform and optionally smoothing the spectra extracting the normalised ratio for a selected peak and displaying the ratio versus frequency data for the peaks selected for analysis . Relevant peaks and amplitudes are identified by a lower threshold and upper threshold that are selected. The broad peaks selected from these results are selected for mapping associated frequency ratio pair data by location. Frequency pair ratio data above the higher threshold may be cut off deleted or recalculated . Alternatively the higher ratio threshold may be readjusted. Maps may be displayed for each selected peak. An example of a map is for an average ratio for VMax VL VR 2 a various frequencies plotted for an acquisition campaign.

While data may be acquired with multi component earthquake seismometer equipment with large dynamic range and enhanced sensitivity many different types of sensor instruments can be used with different underlying technologies and varying sensitivities. Sensor positioning during recording may vary e.g. sensors may be positioned on the ground below the surface or in a borehole. The sensor may be positioned on a tripod or rock pad. Sensors may be enclosed in a protective housing for ocean bottom placement. Wherever sensors are positioned good coupling results in better data. Recording time may vary e.g. from minutes to hours or days. In general terms longer term measurements may be helpful in areas where there is high ambient noise and provide extended periods of data with fewer noise problems.

The layout of a survey may be varied e.g. measurement locations may be close together or spaced widely apart and different locations may be occupied for acquiring measurements consecutively or simultaneously. Simultaneous recording of a plurality of locations may provide for relative consistency in environmental conditions that may be helpful in ameliorating problematic or localized ambient noise not related to subsurface characteristics.
