title: Selection of a data path based on the likelihood that requested information is in a cache
abstract: Embodiments of the present invention are directed to techniques for selecting a data path over which to exchange information between a client device and a storage system by making a selection between a file system server (NAS) data path type (a first data path type) and a direct (SAN) data path type (a second data path type) based on one or more adjustable path selection factors and/or information regarding components of the computer system. For example, a data path may be selected based on a likelihood that requested information will be in a cache of a file system server and/or any other suitable path selection factor.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to techniques for selecting a data path over which to exchange information between a client device and a storage system. More specifically embodiments of the invention relate to processes and systems for making a selection between a first data path and a second data path extending between the client device and the storage system in which the first data path passes through a file system server so that the client device exchanges the information with the storage system using a file system interface for the storage system and in which the second data path does not pass through the file system server.

In some conventional computer configurations a data storage system is employed to provide a centralized storage point for data which may be written to or read from by one or more computers including for example clients and servers referred to collectively as clients coupled to the storage system. These conventional data storage systems may be accessed in a number of ways. In one implementation a file system interface is provided for the data storage system and as the one or more clients exchanges data with the storage system the file system determines where the data should be written to or read from. This is often referred to as a network attached storage NAS system wherein the file system interface enables data on the storage system to be shared by the clients.

A file system interface may be provided via a server that is separate from the data storage system. This implementation removes the processing associated with the file system functionality from the data storage system. In a computer configuration according to this implementation a computer seeking to exchange data with the data storage system will instead exchange data with the file system server and the file system server will use its knowledge of the structure and format of the data storage system to write the data to the data storage system or read the data from the data storage system.

In some conventional networks operating according to the latter technique discussed above it was appreciated that transferring the data from the storage system to the file system server and from the file system server to the requesting client can result in an inefficient extra step in the exchange for some transactions. Some NAS computer configurations therefore used a third technique. In this third implementation a computer seeking to exchange small amounts of data e.g. amounts of data below a specified threshold amount would exchange the data through the file system server over a first data path in the conventional manner but for large amounts of data e.g. amounts of data above the specified threshold amount the client would interact directly with the data storage system over a second data path that does not include the file system server. For large amounts of data then a client would request from the file system server information e.g. metadata about where the requested data is stored on the storage system and then would use this information to interact with the data storage system directly to retrieve the data. An illustrative system which operates according to this technique is the Celerra Multi Path File System MPFS also known as the HighRoad system available from EMC Corporation of Hopkinton Mass.

A conventional computer system implementing the third technique is shown in . A client computer is shown in a computer system along with a file system server and a data storage system . The client computer is connected to the file system server and to the data storage system and the file system server is connected to the data storage system . Computer software is installed on the client computer having instructions on how to exchange data between the client computer and the data storage system and the computer software is configured by an administrator with a threshold size e.g. 64 kilobytes . This threshold is used by the computer i.e. by the computer software executing on the computer when determining how to exchange data between the client computer and the data storage system . For example if a computer seeks to write 32 KB of data to a file stored on the data storage system then the computer will send the 32 KB of data to the file system server and the file system server will write the 32 KB of data to the appropriate location in the data storage system i.e. the location of the file in the data storage system . If however the computer seeks to write 128 KB of data to a file stored on the data storage system then the computer will receive from the file system server metadata specifying the location in the data storage system of the data blocks that make up the file and then will write the 128 KB of data directly to the data storage system in the location s specified by the file system server .

It should be appreciated that the diagram of is merely a simple conceptual representation of the types of systems which may be implemented in accordance with the third technique. In the diagram while one of each element e.g. client computer file system server data storage system is shown in some implementations there may be a plurality of client computers a plurality of file system servers and or a plurality of storage systems. Additionally while the data paths between the elements of the network are shown in as direct connections the data paths may be implemented in any suitable manner such as in a computer network comprising a plurality of network links and networking devices such as routers and switches. Each of the three data paths shown in may be implemented as a separate computer network implemented in any suitable manner i.e. with any suitable network links and any suitable protocol or otherwise. Additionally each of the data paths shown in may be implemented as a plurality of parallel links e.g. the data path between the client computer and the data storage system may be a number of links all connecting the client computer to the data storage system in parallel . Selecting an individual link of a data path once a data path type is selected may be done in any suitable manner. An example of a system that may be used to select a specific link once a path type is selected is the PowerPath system available from EMC Corporation.

When parallel links are employed e.g. between the client computer and the file system server and or the storage system the techniques described above can be employed to select a data path type for handling an I O operation i.e. a data path that passes through the file system server or one that does not and any suitable technique can be employed for selecting one or more specific links of the selected type.

In one embodiment there is provided a method for use in a computer system. The computer system comprises at least one client device at least one storage system that provides at least one volume of storage to store information and at least one file system server that provides a file system interface for at least some of the information stored on the at least one volume of storage. The computer system further comprises at least first and second data paths extending between the at least one client device and the at least one storage system the first data path passing through the at least one file system server so that the at least one client device exchanges information with the at least one storage system via the first path using the file system interface and the second data path not passing through the at least one file system server so that the client device exchanges information with the at least one storage system via the second path using a storage system interface presented by the at least one storage system. The method comprises acts of for an input output I O operation generated by the at least one client device that seeks to exchange a first set of information between the at least one client device and the at least one storage system determining whether the first set of information is likely cached in the at least one file system server and selecting between the first and second data paths for exchanging the first set of information between the at least one client device and the at least one storage system based at least in part on the determination of whether the first set of information is likely cached in the at least one file system server.

In another embodiment there is provided at least one computer readable medium encoded with computer executable instructions that when executed perform a method for use in a computer system. The computer system comprises at least one client device at least one storage system that provides at least one volume of storage to store information and at least one file system server that provides a file system interface for at least some of the information stored on the at least one volume of storage. The computer system further comprises at least first and second data paths extending between the at least one client device and the at least one storage system the first data path passing through the at least one file system server so that the at least one client device exchanges information with the at least one storage system via the first path using the file system interface the second data path not passing through the at least one file system server so that the at least one client device exchanges information with the at least one storage system via the second path using a storage system interface presented by the at least one storage system. The method comprises acts of for an input output I O operation generated by the at least one client device that seeks to exchange a first set of information between the at least one client device and the at least one storage system determining whether the first set of information is likely cached in the at least one file system server and selecting between the first and second data paths for exchanging the first set of information between the at least one client device and the at least one storage system based at least in part on the determination of whether the first set of information is likely cached in the at least one file system server.

In a further embodiment there is provided an apparatus for use in a computer system. The computer system comprises at least one client device at least one storage system that provides at least one volume of storage to store information and at least one file system server that provides a file system interface for at least some of the information stored on the at least one volume of storage. The computer system further comprises at least first and second data paths extending between the at least one client device and the at least one storage system the first data path passing through the at least one file system server so that the at least one client device exchanges information with the at least one storage system via the first path using the file system interface the second data path not passing through the at least one file system server so that the client device exchanges information with the at least one storage system via the second path using a storage system interface presented by the at least one storage system. The apparatus comprises at least one processor programmed to for an input output I O operation generated by the at least one client device that seeks to exchange a first set of information between the at least one client device and the at least one storage system determine whether the first set of information is likely cached in the at least one file system server and select between the first and second data paths for exchanging the first set of information between the at least one client device and the at least one storage system based on the determination of whether the first set of information is likely cached in the at least one file system server.

As discussed above data path type selection in conventional systems with two data paths extending between a client and a data storage system having a file system interface is done based on whether an amount of data to be exchanged exceeds a threshold. The thresholds which are used in conventional systems are fixed values set by configuration files of computer software on the system e.g. on the client device and or on the file system server . In conventional systems an administrator e.g. of a client device and or of a computer network to which the client device is connected specifies the threshold upon installation of the computer software and the threshold is applied to all input output I O operations between the client device and the file system server data storage system. The threshold cannot be changed while the computer software on the client device is executing for either a specific I O operation or even all I O operations but rather the computer on which the configuration software resides must be rebooted before any change in the threshold will be recognized by the computer system.

The reason for conventionally selecting the direct data path type i.e. the one that doesn t pass through the file system server between the client and the storage system for only large files was the assumption that the extra hop for the data in passing through the file system server outweighed any efficiencies in having the file system server handle access requests to the data storage system for large files.

Applicants have appreciated however that there are situations in which it may not be optimal to access e.g. read or write a large file through the direct path or where it may not be optimal to access a small file through the file system server path.

For example in some computer systems multiple clients may be reading information from and writing information to a shared file system. In these systems the client devices may be reading and or writing the same or similar information e.g. the client devices may be executing the same or similar tasks around the same time. The file server typically has a cache of information including files which is stored on the storage system such that it may not need to retrieve information from the storage system each time it receives an access request e.g. if it receives a read request for information in the cache it may provide the information from the cache rather than retrieving it from the storage system . Thus it may be more efficient even for large files to service access requests from data in the file system server cache rather than from the storage system. Additionally Applicants have appreciated that by removing some operations from the storage system and serving them from another component of the system e.g. the file system server resources of the storage system may be used to perform other operations more quickly and efficiently improving the overall performance of the system. Thus in some systems making a selection between data path types based only on the amount of information to be exchanged may not be optimal in all cases but instead it may be more efficient to allow a selection to be made based at least in part on other information e.g. information about whether the data is likely to be in a cache of the file system server .

Accordingly in some embodiments of the invention a data path selection between a first data path type through a file system server e.g. network attached storage NAS system interface such as a Network File System NFS interface or a CIFS interface and a second data path type directly to a storage system e.g. via a Storage Area Network SAN interface is made at least in part on a determination of whether the information to be exchanged is likely to be in a cache of the file system server with the first data path type being selected if the data is likely in the file system server cache and the second data path being selected if it is not likely.

Further while until recently read and write operations traditionally took substantially the same amount of time to complete Applicants have appreciated that storage systems are increasingly capable of performing read operations more efficiently than write operations e.g. in approximately one third of the time required to complete a write operation . Thus Applicants have appreciated that in some systems it is not optimal to base path type selection only on an amount of data to be exchanged because this selection fails to leverage efficiencies that may be gained by routing I O operations according to the type of operation i.e. read write operations . For example if a single data path is carrying intermingled read and write operations then the read operations may be slowed from optimal performance by the slower write operations and the process executing the I O operations may be slowed as a result. Instead because three read operations can be completed in the same time as one write operation it may be advantageous to divide operations between different paths based at least in part on greater type e.g. divide read operations from write operations such that for example read operations can be processed quickly without being slowed by longer write operations.

Accordingly in some embodiments of the invention a data path selection between a first data path type passing through a file system server referred to herein for convenience as a NAS path and a second data path type that does not pass through the file server referred to herein for convenience as a SAN path is made at least in part by examining a type of an operation being executed and selecting the NAS path for read operations and the SAN path for write operations.

Applicants have further appreciated that fixed parameters implemented by conventional systems may not be optimal for governing path type selection for I O operations in all systems. In one exemplary scenario in a computer system comprising a plurality of client devices a file system server and a storage system if all the client devices are requesting to read a large number of small files i.e. files below a threshold from the file system server then response times from the file system server may drop as the file system server works to serve the large number of requests. If a client device in the example is configured to perform path type selection based only on the size of the requested file then the client device may not be able to leverage the unused paths to the storage system to improve overall system performance. Thus Applicants have appreciated that it may be advantageous to permit the system to adjust the path selection factors e.g. parameters thresholds and or weighting factors governing data path type selection based on for example performance characteristics. In contrast to fixed path selection factors in an adjustable system the path selection factors for a data path type selection can be adjusted e.g. a threshold for an amount of data may be lowered when a client device detects from a lowered response time that a file system server is overloaded such that more requests for files may be sent directly to the storage system which may be able to service I O operations faster because it may not be as heavily burdened as the file system server and not to the file system server. Adjusting the path selection factors of a path type selection algorithm in this manner allows a system to adjust to changing characteristics to optimize performance.

Accordingly in some embodiments of the invention a data path type selection between a NAS path and a SAN path is made based at least in part on performance characteristics of one or more components of the computer system.

Additionally or alternatively in some embodiments of the invention path selection factors of a data path type selection process are determined dynamically in response to any suitable conditions including for example performance characteristics for the computer system the type of I O operation being executed or in response to any other suitable condition.

In view of the foregoing some embodiments of the present invention are directed to techniques for making a selection between a file system server NAS data path type a first data path type and a direct SAN data path type a second data path type based on one or more adjustable path selection factors and or information regarding components of the computer system. It should be appreciated that while several techniques for performing a data path type selection are described herein embodiments of the invention are not limited to implementing any particular technique nor are embodiments of the invention limited to implementing each of the described techniques separately as some embodiments of the invention may combine any two or more of the techniques described herein in any suitable manner.

In some embodiments the system may base its data path selection i.e. selection between a NAS path and a SAN path on one or more parameters derived from the client device and or a host process executing on the client device and or may base its path selection on one or more parameters of other components of the computer system. For example in some embodiments of the invention a parameter on which data path type selection is performed is whether the operation to be executed is a read or write operation i.e. the type of the I O operation . As another example a parameter on which a path selection type may be based is whether the information to be read and or written is expected to be in the cache of the file system server. As a further example a parameter on which a data path type selection is made may be any performance characteristic of any element of the computer system e.g. an average response time of a file system server or other characteristics . In some embodiments the path selection factors including parameters may be changed dynamically at any time may be changed globally for all operations by the client device s may be changed for only a specific I O operation or for a specific length of time or may be changed at any other period of time or for any set of operations as the aspects of the present invention related to dynamically adjusting the path selection factors are not limited in this respect.

Process begins in block when a host application executing on a client device issues a command to exchange information with a storage system making the command an I O operation by for example accessing a file in the file system stored on the storage system. Accessing the file or otherwise exchanging information in any other suitable manner may comprise reading and or writing information to the file. The information which is read and or written may comprise any suitable information such as data and or executable instructions. The host application may be any suitable application which may be executing on a client device and seeking to exchange information with the file system. For example a host application exchanging information with the file system may be a word processing application writing to the file system updates to documents which a user has edited a web server reading from the file system web pages to be served a database client querying and updating a database stored in one or more files in the file system or any other suitable host application exchanging any other suitable information.

In block a path selection module receives the command to be executed which was issued in block . The path selection module may be implemented in any suitable way that enables it to see I O operations directed to the file server. For example the path selection module may be implemented on the client device on the file system server or on any other component of a computer system which may see and process I O operations issued by the client device to be received by the file system server as the embodiments of the present invention described herein are not limited in this respect. In the description below the path selection module is described as being implemented on the client device but it should be appreciated that this description is merely illustrative.

In block the path selection module selects a data path type from among the NAS data path type and the SAN data path type over which to exchange the information with the storage system e.g. access the file . Exemplary data paths are discussed below in conjunction with . To select a data path type the path selection module may apply any suitable parameters and examine any suitable information examples of which were discussed above and others of which are discussed in greater detail below to determine which data path type should be employed to handle the I O operation. For example in some embodiments the path selection module may examine for a read operation the likelihood that the information requested is in a cache of the file system server in which case requesting the information from the file system server may be faster than requesting the information directly from the storage system. In some embodiments the path selection module may additionally or alternatively evaluate the response times of other recently executed commands. In this embodiments if it is determined that the file system server is under heavy load from for example being accessed by multiple client devices at the same time it may be more efficient to retrieve the information from the storage system directly than to wait for the file system server to execute a read command. Accordingly the path selection module may examine parameters and information including for example these illustrative parameters and or other parameters and make a selection of a data path type over which to exchange information.

In some embodiments the data path selection module does not select a specific connection e.g. network link over which to exchange information e.g. access a file when multiple connections of the same type exist but may only select a path type. As discussed in greater detail below in some computer systems in which embodiments of the invention may be implemented a NAS path and or a SAN path may be implemented as a plurality of parallel connections. For example a direct SAN path between a client device and a storage system may not be a single direct connection but may include two or more direct connections. In some embodiments the data path selection module may not select a particular connection or network link over which to exchange information but rather may only select in general between the NAS path and the SAN path. Conventional techniques such as techniques implemented by the above referenced PowerPath path management system available from EMC Corporation may be implemented by some embodiments of the invention to select one or more individual connections links over which to exchange information once the path selection module has selected between the NAS path and the SAN path. However it should be appreciated that the embodiments of the invention described herein are not limited in this respect and that a path selection module may be employed that not only selects between a NAS and SAN type path but that also selects one or more specific links of the selected type over which to process the I O operation.

In block a storage driver or other suitable component in the client device exchanges the information over the selected data path i.e. retrieves the desired information from the storage system and or writes the desired information to the storage system and the process ends.

It should be appreciated that process is merely exemplary of the types of processes that may be executed according to embodiments of the invention and that some embodiments of the invention may execute different processes for exchanging information with a storage system. For example while process was discussed in the context of a host application exchanging data with a storage system and interacting with a path selection module to select a path type e.g. via the NAS file server or SAN interface to carry out the exchange in some embodiments of the invention the host application and the path selection module may be the same piece of software or same application e.g. the path selection module functionality may be incorporated into the host application . In alternative embodiments the path selection module may interact with the storage system NAS file server or other system components such as in cases where a path selection module retrieves information useful in selecting a data path type e.g. performance characteristics of components of a computer system from the storage system or elsewhere.

It should also be appreciated that a path selection module may be implemented in any suitable manner. A path selection module may be any suitable software program or programs and may be implemented on a client device on a file system server or on any other suitable component of a computer system. Additionally a path selection module is not limited to being implemented on any single component of a computer system but may in some embodiments be implemented as a distributed module executing on a plurality of components of a computer system e.g. a plurality of client devices and or file system servers and jointly processing information on each of the plurality of components.

Additionally it should be appreciated that while block was discussed in conjunction with exemplary techniques for making a selection of a data path type over which to communicate data and exemplary parameters that may be used in making the selection were discussed any suitable technique may be used and any suitable parameters and information may be considered in selecting a data path type between a NAS path and a SAN path over which to exchange information. Other exemplary parameters and techniques are discussed in greater detail below.

The computer system of comprises a client device a file system server and a storage system . Client device may be any suitable computing device adapted for a specific purpose or for multiple purposes and may in some embodiments be adapted for use by a user. While in client device is shown as a desktop personal computer it should be appreciated that client device is not limited to being implemented as such but may instead be implemented as a laptop personal computer a server e.g. web server mail server etc. a stand alone networking device e.g. a firewall router switch network address translator etc. or any other suitable computing device adapted to execute a process which may seek information from an external storage system. As discussed above the client device may be executing one or more pieces of software such as a host application and or software facilitating communication with the storage system and the NAS file system server and or a path selection module for selecting a data path over which to exchange information with the storage system or NAS file system server.

The storage system may be any suitable storage system having any one or more associated storage medium or media e.g. storage media storing information thereon. For example the storage system may be a disk array comprising a plurality of disk storage media or a system having other types of storage media. The storage system may store any suitable information comprising data and or executable instructions and may be formatted and structured in any suitable manner. One exemplary file system server that may be employed is the Celerra MPFS discussed above and an exemplary storage system with which embodiments of the invention may be used is the CLARiiON storage array available from EMC Corporation though it should be appreciated that the aspects of the present invention described herein can be used in system configurations using any suitable type s of file system servers and storage systems.

Computer system further includes a file system server providing a file system or network attached storage NAS interface for the information stored on storage system . File system server may manage any suitable file system such as a Network File System NFS or a file system using the CIFS protocol. The file system server may maintain on a data store metadata regarding information stored on the storage system . The metadata maintained by the file system server may comprise any suitable information about the storage system such as for example metadata describing where information is stored on the storage system . Metadata may be any suitable data about the information such as a size of a particular content unit of information and or a location of the information on the storage system e.g. which blocks on a logical volume of storage on the storage system store the information .

The file system server may receive requests to exchange information e.g. requests to access files stored in the storage system . For read requests the file system server may retrieve a requested file or other information from the storage system and provide the file to the requesting party e.g. a client device of the computer system . The file system server may also maintain one or more caches not shown . The cache can be updated in any way as embodiments of the invention are not limited to being used with systems having caches of any particular type. As an example of the types of caches which may be implemented by a file system server recently requested information often requested information and or information selected based on any other suitable criteria may be stored in one or more caches. The file system server may in some cases directly provide information to a requesting party from the cache without retrieving the information from the storage system . A file system server that maintains such cache s may also maintain metadata regarding what information is stored in the cache s .

As discussed above the file system server may also be adapted to provide to a requesting party instead of requested information e.g. a file metadata regarding where the requested information is stored in the storage system . In this manner a requesting party e.g. a client device may retrieve from the file system server metadata comprising a location of information e.g. a location of a file on the storage system and then retrieve the information directly from the storage system rather than have the file system server retrieve the information then provide it to the requesting party . An example of such a system is the Celerra Multi Path File System MPFS also known as the HighRoad system available from EMC Corporation. However it should be appreciated that embodiments of the invention are not limited in this respect and may be used with any file system server capable of also returning to a client device the metadata to access a file directly from the storage system.

While shows the computer system components as single units the aspects of the invention described herein can be used in computer systems that may comprise a plurality of client devices a plurality of file system servers and or a plurality of storage systems. The plurality of clients devices file system servers and or storage systems may be implemented as distributed systems or clusters of computing devices each sharing processing load. Additionally it should be appreciated that while shows the file system server and storage system each being connected to the communication network via a single connection the file system server and or storage system server may be connected to the communication network via any suitable number of connections i.e. via a plurality of parallel network links . In such embodiments these connections may be used for executing a plurality of operations in parallel e.g. processing two or more read operations at a given time or may be used for executing a single operation more quickly e.g. providing different portions of a result of a single read operation in parallel . As discussed above it should be appreciated that in some embodiments a data path type selection does not comprise selecting an individual link of a data path over which to exchange information but rather comprises selecting between a first data path type i.e. via a file system server and a second data path type i.e. direct to the storage system . In embodiments of the invention which do implement a data path as a plurality of parallel network links once a data path type has been selected according to any suitable technique such as the exemplary techniques described herein any suitable technique may be implemented to select the network link s of the data path over which to exchange information including techniques implemented by the PowerPath link management system available from EMC Corporation or any other suitable technique .

Each of the system components is connected to a communication network . The communication network may be any suitable wired and or wireless communication medium or media for exchanging data between two or more computers including a private or public network e.g. the Internet . For example the communication network may be at least in part a wireless network operating according to any suitable wireless networking protocol or may be at least in part a wired network operating according to any suitable wired networking protocol such as Ethernet or Fibre Channel Protocol FCP .

While information may travel between the components of the computer system in any suitable manner through the communication network i.e. over any particular network link or combination of network links the client device may be thought of as connected to the storage system via two types of distinct data paths though there can be multiple parallel links of each type . A first data path type comprising the abstract links A and B passes through the file system server and may be referred to as the network attached storage NAS path. Over this first data path type a client device may request information e.g. files from the storage system via the file system server . The file system server may upon receiving a request for a file or other information from the client device retrieve from its data store metadata regarding the requested file including for example location s at which the desired information is stored on the storage system retrieve the information from the storage system according to the metadata and then provide the information to the client device . Alternatively if the requested file exists in a cache of the file system server the file system server may provide the file to the client device without retrieving the file from the storage system . Additionally a client device may write a file to the file server and the file system server may store the information of the file on the storage system .

Alternatively the client device may request information directly from the storage system over a second data path type comprising abstract link which may be referred to as a storage area network SAN path. Over the second data path type the client device may transmit to the storage system information to be written to the storage system or may transmit a read request for information to be retrieved and provided to the client device . To perform such an operation on a file the client device may use information about the structure and format of how the file is stored on the storage system . For example to read a file or other information from the storage system or to write a file to the storage system the client device may use information about where the file is located on the storage system i.e. from or to where the information should be read or written . A client device may request from the file system server over first data path A metadata for a file specifying where the information in the file is to be read from or written to in the storage system and then may directly access the storage system over second data path using the metadata provided by the file system server .

In some embodiments of the invention the physical connections used to implement first data path type i.e. the NAS data path and second data path type i.e. the SAN data path may be substantially similar save for the interaction with the file system server . In other words the network links over which the information travels may be similar. In other embodiments however the network links of the first data path type may be completely separate from the network links of the second data path For example in one embodiment of the invention abstract links A and B may be Ethernet network links while abstract link may be a fiber optic network. In such embodiments then there may not be a single communication network over which information is exchanged. Instead communication network may be implemented as two or more communication networks. Alternatively one of the types of data paths may be implemented in a communication network while the other type of data path may be a direct connection consisting of a single link. For example the first data path type may be implemented in an Ethernet network but the second data path may be a direct single link fiber optic connection between the client device and the storage system . It should be appreciated that the first and second types of data paths may be implemented in any suitable manner as embodiments of the invention are not limited in this regard. Further as discussed above each data path may be implemented as a plurality of connections links in some embodiments of the invention. For example the SAN data path between the client device and the storage system may be implemented as a plurality of parallel links such as a plurality of parallel direct fiber optic channels.

As discussed above a path selection module operating according to some embodiments of the invention may implement one or more techniques for selecting between data path types when determining how to exchange information e.g. access files in a file system implemented via a file system server and stored on a storage system to which the client also has direct i.e. not through the file system server access. In conventional systems of this type a data path type was selected based purely on a fixed threshold amount of data i.e. small files were accessed via the first data path through the file system server and larger ones were not. Applicants appreciated that this technique is not optimum in all situations because it does not take into account other properties or characteristics of the computer system.

In accordance with some embodiments of the invention data path type selection may be based on any suitable parameter s and or information about the client device initiating an access request and or about the computer system in which the client device is acting. Exemplary techniques for selecting a data path type based on information about a client device and or about the computer system in which the client device is acting are discussed below. It should be appreciated however that these techniques are merely illustrative. Embodiments of the invention are not limited to implementing any specific technique but rather may implement any suitable technique and consider any of the parameters or any combination thereof discussed herein to select a data path type.

Process begins in block wherein a path selection module receives a command issued by a client device to exchange information with the storage system . This command may for example seek to access a file managed by the file system e.g. the file system server of . The command may be received from a host application executing on the client device and may be detected by any component of the computer system and presented to the path selection module. In one embodiment the path selection module may reside on the client device in any location where it may see access requests to the file system. It should be appreciated however that all embodiments are not limited in this respect as the path selection module can be implemented on any component of the computer system e.g. on the file system server or elsewhere .

In block the path selection module evaluates the received command to determine a type of the I O operation. More specifically the path selection module evaluates the I O operation to determine whether the operation is a read operation meaning it is seeking to read information from a file or a write operation meaning it is seeking to write information to the file.

If in block it is determined that the I O operation is a write operation then in block the path selection module selects the direct data path type that does pass through the file system server i.e. the second data path or SAN data path . If however the I O operation is a read operation then in block the path selection module selects the data path type that passes through the file system server i.e. the first data path or NAS path to process the I O operation.

Once a data path type is selected in either of block or the process ends. Ending the process may comprise any suitable act such as providing an indication of the selected data path to another component of the computer system. In this respect the aspects of the present invention described herein are directed to techniques for selecting between a first data path type a NAS data path and a second data path type a SAN data path based upon one or more novel selection criteria but the aspects of the present invention described herein are not limited in any way by the ways in which accesses are coordinated by the client device file system server and storage system over the different data paths. For example in a computer system employing the Celerra MPFS system a protocol is established for communicating between the file system server and the client device to control access over the direct data path to the storage system i.e. the second data path or SAN data path and path selections are made based on the size of the file. In one embodiment the path selection module can replace the component in that system that performs data path selection but the invention is not limited in this respect as the path selection module can communication the selected data path to any suitable entity in the computer system.

The selection based on operation type i.e. whether the operation is a read operation or a write operation may be employed in some configurations for any of numerous reasons. For example it may be assumed that multiple client devices in the computer system may seek to read the same or similar information e.g. files from the storage system around the same time. In addition related files may be stored in the same blocks of the storage system such that when the storage systems returns information to the file system server in response to a read request it may also return other information or related files if the other information or related files are stored in the same blocks on the storage system . Thus as client devices may often seek to read related files around the same time for any read request there is a possibility that the information requested e.g. the requested file may be in the cache of the file system server . If the information is in the cache of the file system server then it may be faster to retrieve the information from the cache via the first data path than to retrieve the metadata for the information from the file system server and then retrieve the information directly from the storage system via the second data path .

While the path selection module may not be certain that optimal performance will be achieved by performing a specific read operation through the first data path i.e. NAS data path rather than via the file system server by determining to perform all read operations through the first data path the path selection module may assume that over time the overall performance of the computer system e.g. the overall efficiency of all the client devices may benefit from that decision.

Furthermore as discussed above modern storage systems are capable of executing a read operation in approximately one third the time required to execute a write operation. If a buffer on a data path in a conventional system contains one write operation at the top of the stack and three read operations behind it then those three read operations may need to wait for the write operation to be fully executed before any of the read operations could be executed. Assuming that a read operation takes T milliseconds to execute then this sequence of operations would take 6 T milliseconds to execute 3 T for the write operation and 1 T for each of the three read operations executed in succession . However if the read operations were processed on a separate data path than the write operation and executed in parallel then the three read operations could finish executing at about the same time as the one write operation. The overall time to complete the four operations would therefore be 3 T milliseconds 3 T for the write operation and at the same time as the write operation is executing 1 T for each of the three read operations. Thus by separating the read operations from the write operation in this example the four operations could be completed in half the time. This benefit may be scaled to the overall system if all read operations were handled on one of the paths such as the first data path A B of i.e. the NAS data path and all write operations were handled on the other such as the second data path of i.e. the SAN data path .

It should be appreciated however that the assumption that files or other information being read often may be in the cache of the file system server may not apply to all computer systems because in some configurations each client device may be executing substantially different applications and therefore may not be reading the same or related files around the same time.

Thus in accordance with one embodiment Applicants have appreciated that it would be beneficial in making a path selection to know whether the information being requested is definitively in the cache of the file system server or at least is likely to be. shows a second exemplary process for selecting a data path between the first NAS data path and the second SAN data path based on information about the computer system in which a client device is operating. In the exemplary process the information which is evaluated relates to whether the desired information to be exchanged e.g. the requested file is likely to be in a cache of the file system server .

Process begins in block in which the path selection module receives a command to access a file or any other suitable information . In block the path selection module evaluates the received command to determine a type of the I O operation i.e. whether the operation is a read operation or a write operation . If it is determined in block that the I O operation is a write operation then the second SAN data path may be selected in block as in the process of and the process ends. If however the I O operation is a read operation then in block the process determines the likelihood that the file being requested by the read operation is in the cache of the file system server .

The determination in block of whether the requested information is likely in the cache may be made in any suitable manner based on any suitable information. For example in some embodiments of the invention the path selection module may query the file system server requesting that the file system server inform the path selection module whether the requested file is in the cache. If the file system server responds positively then the path selection module may determine that it is likely that the information is in the cache i.e. the likelihood is 100 percent . This embodiment may be particularly advantageous when the path selection module is implemented in the file system server but it can be used no matter where the path selection module is implemented.

In some embodiments rather than querying the file system server for a definitive determination of whether the requested file is in its cache the path selection module may make an assessment of the likelihood based on other information. For example the path selection module may determine whether the file has been requested from the file system server in the recent past within a threshold amount of time and if so may determine a likelihood of whether the file is still in the cache of the file system server . For example if the file was requested from the file system server within the last T milliseconds then the path selection module may determine that it is very likely that the information is still in the cache but if the information was requested 2 T milliseconds ago the path selection module may determine that it is only somewhat likely that the information is still in the cache and if the information was requested 3 T milliseconds ago the path selection module may determine that it is not likely that the information is in the cache. These are merely examples of the ways the path selection module can use information from the computer system to dynamically determine a likelihood that a requested file is in the cache. It should be appreciated that embodiments of the invention are not limited to implementing these techniques as embodiments of the invention may make a determination of whether a file is likely to be in a cache of the file system server in any suitable manner.

In some embodiments of the invention the path selection module may evaluate not just the recent I O operations of a requesting client device when evaluating whether a file is likely to be in a cache of the file system server but may additionally or alternatively evaluate the operations of other client devices in the computer system. For example if other client devices in the computer system are executing the same or similar operations as the requesting client device the path selection module may consider it more likely that the requested file is in a cache of the file system server than if the other client devices are executing operations dissimilar to the operations being executed by the requesting client device . The path selection module could determine what operations are being executed by the other client devices in any suitable manner such as by querying a host application that issued the I O operation which is seeking to access the file for information it has about the other client devices. For example if the host application is aware that it is in a distributed processing cluster with the other client devices each of them processing a piece of a single overall process then the path selection module may determine that it is likely that the other client devices are processing the same or similar information as the requesting client device and thus may determine that it is likely that the requested file is in a cache of the file system server . Alternatively the path selection module can query the other client devices to determine the operations they are executing and the files they have recently accessed. Just as the path selection module can query the file system server to determine whether a requested file is in the cache the path selection module can query the other client devices to determine if another client device had recently requested the file. As another example the path selection module could infer based on the number of other client devices in the computer system whether it is likely that the file was recently requested and thus whether it is likely that the file is in the cache of the file system server . For example if there is only a small number of other client devices it may be unlikely that another client device had recently requested the file but if there is a large number of other client devices the likelihood that at least one other client device recently requested the file may be greater.

In some embodiments of the invention rather than examining operations executed by the requesting client device itself or by other client devices in the computer system the path selection module may examine one or more performance characteristics of the file system server to infer whether a requested file and or other requested information is likely in the cache. A performance characteristic may be any suitable characteristic of a component of the computer system e.g. the file system server and may be used in any suitable manner to make any suitable determination. Other exemplary performance characteristics and techniques for evaluating them to make a path type selection are discussed in greater detail below.

For example one performance characteristic of the file system server which may indicate whether or not a requested file is likely in a cache is the response time for accesses via the first NAS data path. By evaluating response times for I O operations over the NAS first data path over a given period of time the path selection module can identify operations that were executed so quickly that the requested file s and or other information must have been serviced through a cache of the file system server i.e. for which operations the information and or file s were located in the cache . If the path selection module determines that over some period of time the file system server is responding to requests so quickly that the file system server is often finding the information in its cache the path selection module may assume that the likelihood that the file s and or other information requested next is are in the cache as well is high. The time period evaluated can be any suitable time period. For example it may be relatively short e.g. for the last few I O operations that may be assumed to be related to a next I O operation or a longer period to provide a more comprehensive view of an average cache hit rate in the cache s of the file system server . Thus it should be appreciated that this aspect of the present invention is not limited to being implemented with any particular technique and or time span for evaluating response times of a file system server .

Alternatively rather than the path selection module inferring a performance characteristic indirectly the characteristic may be provided to the path selection module directly. For example a file system server may make available to the path selection module its cache hit rate which indicates the percentage of requests for information e.g. files for which the information e.g. files was found in a cache. Thus the path selection module may examine the cache hit rate and determine from it whether it is likely that a requested file and or other information will be in the cache e.g. if a cache hit rate is 80 percent the information may be likely to be in the cache but if the cache hit rate is 20 percent the information may not be likely to be in the cache . It should be appreciated that as discussed below in greater detail a cache hit rate is only one example of a performance characteristic that may be directly provided to the path selection module as others are possible.

As another example the path selection module may examine characteristics of the information requested as well as characteristics of the cache itself to make a determination as to whether the information is likely to be in the cache. For example if a client device is seeking to read a ten gigabyte file and the cache of the file system server can store only one gigabyte of information then the path selection module may recognize that the file cannot be fully serviced from the cache because the information could not fit in the cache and thus the file is not likely to be in the cache.

In block if the likelihood determined in block is above a threshold the path selection module will select in block the first NAS data path as the data path to service the read operation based on the likelihood that the file and or other information is in the cache. If the likelihood is below the threshold then the path selection module in block will select the second SAN data path as the data path over which to service the read operation. Once a data path type is selected then the process ends and as in block the path selection module may notify any other appropriate component of the system which will facilitate execution of the I O operation over the selected data path type.

The decision in block may be made in any suitable manner. For example the path selection module may have a threshold of sixty percent likelihood for choosing the first NAS data path and trying to take advantage of the cache but this is merely an example as any threshold can be used. If the file system server has an eighty percent cache hit rate then path selection module may select the first data path and attempt to take advantage of the cache of the file system server . If however the cache hit rate is twenty percent then the path selection module may select the second SAN data path because the information is unlikely to be in the cache and it may be faster to exchange the information directly with the storage system in cases where the file s and or other information is are not in a cache of the file system server .

It should be appreciated that the process of is merely exemplary and that other techniques for selecting a data path type between a first NAS data path and a second SAN data path in accordance with embodiments of the invention are possible. Additionally it should be appreciated that the types of information described above in conjunction with blocks and that may be evaluated by embodiments of the invention are merely illustrative of the types of information that may be evaluated as other types of information may additionally or alternatively be evaluated. Additionally while the types of information described above are described distinctly any two or more of these types or other types of information may be evaluated together to determine the likelihood that information may be in the cache. For example the path selection module may evaluate the operations executed by the client devices in the computer system other than the client device which issued the I O operation and determine based on that fact alone that it is unlikely that the information will be found in the cache but may also examine a cache hit rate for the file system server and determine that it is likely based on that fact alone that the information will be found in the cache. The client device may then weigh these two determinations and determine an overall likelihood. The overall likelihood may be determined in any suitable manner such as by setting weights for various terms in a calculation that may be made. Weights may be assigned for any suitable reason such as certainty of a term in the calculation e.g. an estimate made based on the number of client devices in the computer system may be less reliable and therefore may be weighted less in a calculation of overall likelihood than other factors such as historical cache hit rate .

As mentioned above one embodiment of the invention is directed to making a dynamic determination of whether to service an I O operation via a NAS or SAN data path rather than based upon a static determination based on file size as was done in the prior art. Any performance characteristic of any component of a computer system may be evaluated in making a determination of which data path to employ as this aspect of the invention is not limited in this respect.

A performance characteristic may be any information relating to any one or more components of the computer system which may affect the performance of handling an I O operation in the computer system and may include information about the one or more components about sets of operations and or individual operations handled by the component. For example a cache hit rate for a component e.g. a cache hit rate for the file system server or a cache hit rate for the storage system a response time for a component and or a cache size for a component may be evaluated. Additionally operations recently executed by one or more components of the computer system e.g. operations recently executed by a requesting client device may be a performance characteristic that can be evaluated as the operations may serve as an indication of a likely cache hit rate. Other performance characteristics may include a load rate of a component i.e. a percent utilization of the component a bandwidth of a data path to the component or other characteristics.

Process of begins in block wherein the path selection module receives a command to access a file and or other information . In block the path selection module retrieves at least one performance characteristic of the computer system. This may be done in any suitable way. For example information on the at least one performance characteristic may be retrieved from a data store of the client device e.g. the performance characteristic relates to characteristics of the client device itself such as recently executed operations . Alternatively the path selection module may maintain a data store of such information on the performance characteristics of any one or more components of the computer system. Alternatively retrieving the characteristics in block may comprise requesting the characteristic from at least one other component of the computer system including components that have information on their own particular parameters.

In block the path selection module examines the at least one performance characteristic. Examining may comprise any one or more actions related to evaluating the performance characteristic. For example if the performance characteristics is a cache hit rate e.g. of a cache in the file system sensor evaluating the cache hit rate may comprise determining whether the cache hit rate is sufficiently high to make it likely that requested information is in the cache. As another example if the performance characteristic is a size of a file system server cache then examining the performance characteristic may comprise determining whether the amount of information to be requested is larger than the file system server cache thus making it likely that the information is not in the cache . As a further example if the performance characteristic is a load rate on a file system server i.e. percent utilization of the file system server then examining the performance characteristic may comprise determining whether the load rate is so high that the likelihood that the file system server will be able to timely handle any I O operation is low and thus determining whether it is more efficient to exchange information with the storage system rather than the file system server. These are merely examples of the ways those parameter performance characteristics may be evaluated.

Any suitable performance characteristic or characteristics may be evaluated by embodiments of the invention relating to any combination of various type s of characteristics and or types of components to which they relate rather than only one performance characteristic only one type of performance characteristic or performance characteristics for only one component . For example examining a performance characteristic may comprise comparing a load rate for a storage system and a load rate for a file system server to determine which component has more available resources to handle an I O operation and thus which will be able to execute an operation more timely and more efficiently .

As another example of the types of characteristics that may be examined in block a load rate of a file system server a cache hit rate of the file system server and or a bandwidth of the SAN data path to a storage system may be examined to determine whether better performance in servicing a particular I O operation is likely to be achieved over the SAN data path or over the NAS data path. For example if the file system server has a high cache hit rate suggesting that I O may be serviced quickest by the file system server if the file is in the cache but a high load rate suggesting it may be more efficient to access information directly from the storage system via the SAN data path to avoid waiting for an operation to be executed by the file system server the path selection module may weigh these factors against a bandwidth of the SAN data path. If the bandwidth of the SAN data path is low then it may be worth waiting whatever time is necessary to gain the benefit of the cache of the file system server but if the bandwidth of the SAN data path is high then it may be quicker to use the SAN data path than wait for the file system server to execute an operation.

Both the types of performance characteristics described and the specific ways in which they are evaluated are merely exemplary as it should be appreciated that each performance characteristic can be evaluated and or weighted in any suitable way and that the embodiment of the invention directed to evaluating a performance characteristic of the system is not limited to the specific examples shown and can evaluate any suitable performance characteristic some of which may relate to past historical performance of the system others of which may relate to attributes of the system that are unrelated to any particular I O operation etc.

In addition it should be appreciated that the embodiment directed to evaluating a performance characteristic is not limited to selecting a path seeking to maximize the performance of the particular I O but rather can seek to maximize performance of overall system operation even at the expense of selecting a path for a particular I O that is not expected to maximize its performance.

In block based on this examination of the at least one performance characteristic a data path type is selected. Once a data path is selected the process ends in much the same manner as described above in connection with and .

As discussed above some embodiments of the invention are directed to selecting between a NAS data path and a SAN data path for a data path over which to exchange information with maximum efficiency. This selection may be made in any suitable manner according to any suitable process including by any of the exemplary processes discussed above. Some processes executed by embodiments of the invention may include fixed parameters such as all read operations exchange information over a first data path type e.g. the NAS path and all writes exchange information over a second path type e.g. the NAS path while others may operate using threshold levels such as a threshold level of likelihood that information will be in a cache of a file system server. Some embodiments of the invention which evaluate one or more parameters or threshold levels may be adapted to change those parameters and or threshold levels dynamically i.e. without restarting the device s on which the path selection module is implemented and or software related to it such as a driver and or over time to adjust to changing conditions in the computer system. Additionally or alternatively the path selection module may be adapted to change the path selection factors it evaluates to adjust to changing conditions in the computer system.

For example assume that an illustrative computer system includes a file system server that at a particular point in time consistently has a low cache hit rate. Accordingly the path selection module may be programmed to weight less or not evaluate in a path selection process the likelihood that information will be in the cache. However due to changes in the computer system e.g. the client devices executing different applications processing different information the cache hit rate on the file system server may increase to a sustained high level. A path selection module may be adapted to recognize this increase in cache hit rate in some way and adjust the path selection factors it applies in making a selection of a data path type over which to access files and or exchange information. Adjusting path selection factors may comprise any suitable adjustment such as adjusting parameters of a decision e.g. adding cache hit rate adjusting a threshold for a parameter e.g. lowering the acceptable cache hit rate and or adjusting a weighting factor for a parameter e.g. making cache hit rate more important in the decision than it was previously .

Adjustment of the manner of operation of path selection mechanism may be done in any suitable manner. For example parameters of a data path type selection process may be adjusted globally for all operations evaluated by the path selection mechanism. Alternatively parameters may be adjusted for a particular I O operation or set of I O operations. A particular set of I O operations may be I O operations within a particular time span operations which are related to a particular information exchange session or file or may be related in any other desired way. An information exchange session may be established using any suitable information. A file handle uniquely identifies a file and may comprise information about it.

In one embodiment the file handle or other identifier for a file may be used by the path selection to make decisions based upon the identity of the target file for the I O operation. For example if the path selection module knows that a particular set of operations are going to be executed for which it would be advantageous to use a particular data path type or for which the default parameters would otherwise not result in an optimal selection the path selection module may change the path selection factors for operations related to the file to force a more optimal selection. For example if the default path selection factors for the path selection module stipulate that all reads are to be performed over the NAS data path i.e. through the file system server and the path selection module is aware that all operations related to a particular file are going to be retrieving data larger than the size of the cache of the file system server meaning the read operations would not benefit from the cache of the file system server as the files would be too large to be preserved in the cache the path selection module may override the path selection factors on which the data path selection decision is made such that some or all of the read operations associated with the file could be performed over the SAN data path i.e. the information is exchanged directly with the storage system .

By way of context for the example the path selection module is configured with global parameters indicating that it should send read operations through the SAN data path if the cache hit rate of the file system server is above sixty percent i.e. more than sixty percent of I O operations passed through the file system server are served from the cache instead of the storage system .

Process begins in block wherein the path selection module receives one or more commands from for example a host application executing on the client device requesting that information related to a file be exchanged with the storage system .

In block the path selection module examines the operation s to be executed. The path selection module may detect or be informed by the host application that the host application will be performing several read operations within a short time span. From this examination of block the path selection module may determine that it would be efficient to perform the read operations through the file system server to gain the advantage of the cache of the file system server even if the globally applied path selection factors suggest that the NAS path type should only be selected if the file server cache hit rate is above sixty percent as the short term I O distribution may differ from the historical norms on which the global factors and their evaluation were determined.

In block the path selection module establishes a set of temporary path selection factors considered by the path selection module when determining a data path over which to exchange information related to this I O operation s . The temporary path selection factors may be substantially similar to the existing global parameters or may be entirely different. For example the new path selection factors may lower the cache hit rate threshold from sixty percent to forty percent such that it is more likely that the NAS data path will be selected. Alternatively the new path selection factors may simply stipulate that all reads for the file will be performed over the NAS data path. Any suitable new rules may be established for the path selection module to apply to the operations related to the file and they may be established in any suitable way including directly via another entity in the computer system e.g. the application program issuing the I O operation.

Once the operations are completed as determined by block in block the path selection module deletes the new path selection factors which have been added. It should be appreciated that the reference s to setting new temporary parameters and deleting them are used conceptually and not intended to limit the manner in which the path selection module is implemented to allow for dynamic input into the selection process for some subset of I O operations. For example while the parameters weightings evaluation thresholds etc. may all be modified the dynamic capability may also be provided by the path selection module applying making a selection decision that evaluates different parameters weightings and or thresholds depending on some dynamic trigger but that does not delete any prior evaluation parameters weightings and or thresholds but simply recognizes which to apply for any particular I O operation.

Embodiments of the invention are not limited to any particular technique for dynamically adjusting the data path selection algorithm e.g. by varying the parameters evaluation thresholds and or weightings for any of the parameters either for all operations or a subset of even a single operation. The process is merely exemplary of techniques which may be implemented by some embodiments of the invention to carry out this function.

For example in some embodiments of the invention temporary adjustments to the path selection process may be established not based on a file but may instead be established for a set period of time. For example the path selection algorithm may be changed for a period of time when fewer client devices are executing I O operations and requesting or issuing information e.g. at night or at lunchtime . Alternatively the algorithm could be changed not for a set period of time or a set of operations but rather could be set for all operations executed from a particular path selection module. In this latter case rather than establishing a new set of parameters thresholds and or weightings the path selection module could change the original parameters of the client device or remove the old parameters and create new parameters. As discussed above while conventional systems required that at least some components of the system be restarted before any new or different parameters thresholds or weightings collectively path selection factors could be evaluated and could only evaluate global parameters e.g. parameters for all operations not for specific sets of operations in some embodiments of the invention these path selection factors could be created and changed dynamically without restarting the path selection module or any device on which it executes and can be changed on a per operation basis.

In an alternate embodiment another parameter that may be evaluated is whether a file is stored on a storage system in multiple non contiguous parts stored at different locations on the storage system such that a read operation to retrieve the file will require multiple read operations to the storage system to retrieve all parts of the file. For some systems e.g. those with a heavy load on the file system server it may be desirable to select the SAN path to process an access to such a file so that the client device can send the multiple I O operations directly to the storage system rather than have the file system server execute one large I O operation comprising multiple smaller I O operations which unburdens the file system server .

As another example if the client device determines that a component of the computer system e.g. the file system server is under a heavy load then it may determine that it will be more efficient for the computer system as a whole even though it may not be more efficient for the client device to issue an operation to the component to exchange only a portion of the information which is to be exchanged e.g. read part of a file rather than a whole file . Thus the component may execute the smaller operation e.g. reading part of a file and exchange the portion of information quickly and move on to the operations of other client devices more quickly and the computer system as a whole may become more efficient. Thus changing the manner of operation of the client device may comprise changing parameters of the client device as above and or may comprise changing operations to be executed by the client device .

Changes may be made to the operation of the path selection module in any suitable manner. For example as discussed above in conjunction with the path selection factors may be changed by the path selection module based on determinations that it the path selection module has made. Alternatively path selection factors could be changed by a host application executing on the client device . For example a host application having knowledge of various characteristics of the computer system and of which operations it is going to be executing in the future may make changes to the path selection factors by which a data path for those operations is selected such that the operations may be executed in the most efficient manner.

In some such embodiments of the invention which permit a host application or other system component to dynamically impact any of the path selection factors discussed above an Application Programming Interface API may be implemented for the path selection module to provide a host application the ability to retrieve information on characteristics of the computer system relevant to path selection e.g. a cache hit rate and or cache size of a file system server and or to impact the path selection factors upon which a data path is selected. The API may comprise any suitable functions for setting path selection factors of a data path selection process and or for retrieving from one or more components of a computer system information e.g. performance characteristics including system configuration information such as cache size etc. that may be used to make a path selection.

For example the API may have a function mpfs fallthru to nfs to specify that all information should be exchanged with the file system server via the first NAS data path i.e. all information should be exchanged via the Network File System NFS . This function may specify that all information be exchanged over the first NAS data path for all I O operations executed from a particular client device may specify that only a specified subset of operations exchange information over the first NAS data path e.g. only read operations only operations associated with a specific file only operations within a certain time window etc. that operations should all be processed over the first NAS data path for a specified period of time or may specify the impacted operations in any other suitable way. An API may additionally or alternatively have a function mpfs fallback to san which may specify that all information be exchanged with the storage system via the second SAN data path for operations specified in any suitable way including the examples described above for the NAS data path . In another embodiment an API function mpfs set min filesize may be implemented which sets a minimum amount of data that may be exchanged directly with the storage system over the second data path such that the path selection module will ensure that all other information amounts of information less than the minimum are transferred over the first NAS data path via the file system server .

It should be appreciated that one or more API functions can be defined to perform any of the functions described herein to facilitate path type selection including setting path selection factors for the path selection module and retrieving performance characteristics and or other information from components of the computer system. APIs functions may be implemented to send the performance characteristics and or other information may be to the path selection module directly to facilitate path selection or to send the performance characteristics and or other information another component in the computer system e.g. a client device to inform that component in dynamically influencing the path selection performed by the path selection module. It should be appreciated that embodiments of the invention are not limited to implementing one or more APIs as the described function s can be performed in any suitable way.

As discussed above in one embodiment a host application of a client device or other system component may make decisions regarding how a data path type should be selected between the first NAS data path and the second SAN data path. The decision regarding this selection is not limited however to being made by a path selection module on the client device . In some embodiments of the invention the data path may be selected by the path selection module in other components in the computer system.

One component of the path selection module may be in a host as described above and another may be in the file system server . Upon receiving an I O instruction from the client device the path selection module component in the file system server may also receive a path selection made by the path selection module component in the host or elsewhere . If the path selection module component in the file system server determines that the first NAS data path is the more efficient path for a particular operation e.g. because the request file is in the cache of the file system server it may override any contrary selection by the path selection module component in the client and return the data from the cache.

In another embodiment the path selection module may be implemented entirely in the file system server . When the file system server provides an indication of its selected path to the client device then the file system server may also provide any necessary metadata regarding one or more files to the client device .

When the path selection module is in the file system server it may make the path selection in any suitable manner such as by any of the techniques discussed above.

In another alternative embodiment when the path selection module is outside of the file system server e.g. in a client the file system server may perform any suitable operation to influence the path selection performed by the path selection module to ensure that the most efficient data path is selected each time a selection is made. For example a file system server may inform a path selection module in a client device that the file system server has recognized that the other client devices in the computer system are on the whole not requesting the same information as the client device and thus the information requested by the client device is not likely to be in the cache of the file system server . Thus it is inefficient for the path selection module to select the NAS data path in these circumstances. The file system server may provide an indicator of this to the path selection module as above and allow the path selection module to change its path selection factors if it determines that the change would lead to a more optimal selection of data path type or not change the path selection factors if the path selection module determines that it would not lead to a more optimal selection or in some embodiments of the invention the file system server may change the path selection factors of the path selection module to ensure that the SAN data path is selected instead of the NAS data path.

As another example if a file system server determines that a heavy load is being placed on it as the client devices in the computer system are issuing a large number of requests to exchange information over the NAS data path and this load is leading to a less efficient performance of the file system server as some operations must wait a long time in an operation queue before the file system server is able to execute the operations then the file system server may send an indicator of this load to the path selection module in one or more client devices or change the path selection factors of one or more path selection module components. Based on this the one or more path selection module components may be more apt to select the SAN data path rather than the NAS data path which will lessen the load on the file system server and allow the file system server to execute more timely the operations it receives and thus increase efficiency in the computer system .

A file system server or other component of the computer system may change the path selection factors of a path selection module in any suitable manner examples of which are described above. In some embodiments the change in path selection factors may be an operation left to the path selection mechanism itself but an indication may be sent to the path selection mechanism from the file system server or other component informing it of one or more changes and the client device may change the path selection factors based on the indication. In alternative embodiments however a file system server or other component may execute one or more functions that directly edit the one or more path selection factors on the client device. These functions may be in the form of an Application Programming Interface API as discussed above and may transmit the commands in any suitable manner. For example in some embodiments of the invention the commands may be transmitted from a component of the computer system such as the file system server to a path selection module in another device using any suitable networking protocol such as the Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP .

Further a component of the computer system e.g. file system server may be adapted to change the I O operations to be executed by a client device . Just as the client device may divide an operation to be executed into two or more smaller operations or make any other suitable division in some embodiments of the invention another component of the computer system may force such a division on the client device to increase efficiency in the computer system. For example just as a client device may divide an operation based on a determination that the file is fragmented on the storage system i.e. divided into multiple parts and stored in multiple locations a file system server may determine that a file has been fragmented and may divide a single I O operation into multiple I O operations related to the fragments of the file increase the efficiency in exchanging information related to the file. For example if a client device requests metadata related to a file from the file system server then the file system server may provide the metadata in smaller sets related to the fragmentation of the file or a file system server may provide in a first response to the request for metadata only metadata related to a first portion of the file and may provide in subsequent responses metadata related to other portions of the file. As another example if a file system server is overburdened it may force a drop in its load by only allowing client devices to issue operations for exchanging small amounts of information by for example only providing metadata for smaller operations including by only providing a smaller part of metadata related to a large file as discussed in the first example . The path selection mechanism upon detecting that a file system server is distributing metadata in this fashion may select the SAN data path as the data path over which to access the file. This may be done to lower the burden on the file system server . By removing the multiple file access operations from the file system server and executing them on the client device over the SAN path directly to the storage system the file system server will have more available resources and may therefore be able to more quickly respond to new operations from other client devices or from the same client device and the execution speed of the entire system may be increased.

It should be appreciated that the above described techniques for selecting a data path type over which to exchange information related to one or more I O operations are merely exemplary of the techniques which may be implemented by embodiments of the invention for making a selection based on one or more adjustable parameters and information regarding components and or performance of the computer system. Any suitable information which may be retrieved from any suitable component of a computer system e.g. the client device another client device a file system server a storage system any combination of two or more of these components etc. may be used to make a decision as to a data path type to select and or may be used to adjust path selection factors of a path selection factors for all operations or a subset of operations. Embodiments of the invention are not limited to executing any particular process or examining any particular type s of information in selecting a data path type over which to exchange information.
