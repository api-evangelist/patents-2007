The following application is cross referenced and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 740 740 entitled BUSINESS METRICS AGGREGATED BY CUSTOM HIERARCHY having inventors Myerson et al. filed on Apr. 26 2007.

Information technology IT systems are important to maintaining business operations. IT system health is typically monitored by the business to determine how the system is operating and whether business goals are being met. Monitoring IT system health is important to keeping the IT system reliable and effective and for providing a successful business.

Most IT monitoring systems are designed for a specific IT system. Thus the monitoring system is usually hard coded to address specific features of the particular IT system. To make changes to the monitoring system requires significant time and resources to change the underlying code of the system. For example changing a typical monitoring system would require a change in monitoring system code a new executable file or other significant and time consuming changes to the system. It is desirable to have a flexible monitoring system for monitoring an IT system.

A metrics generation system provides metrics for an IT point of sale manufacturing or some other computing system from different data sources in a single display. Configuration files containing parameters and instructions are loaded by the system to access different data sources. The configuration files may identify the data source location the data to retrieve and other information regarding data extraction. Once retrieved the data is placed into a single data schema processed and placed into a metric hierarchy. The metric hierarchy is specified by a user through configuration files. The metrics generation system is flexible in that it can be changed to extract data from different IT data sources calculate different metric information having a hierarchy of attributes and display a variety of metric data in different formats.

Data processing and display are performed in a flexible and dynamic manner based on parameters and instructions contained in one or more configuration files. Configuration files are used to define tasks for data extraction processing and display set attribute values which define metrics to be calculated and displayed and otherwise configure aspects of the middle tier and presentation tier of the present technology. The configuration files can be generated by a user manually through an application in response to user input as a deliverable such as an update or some other manner.

One embodiment receives configuration files which include server extraction parameters. A unique query is generated for a first server and second server based on the server extraction parameters. The first server and second server have a different communication interface and are associated with different server extraction parameters. The first unique query is sent to the first server and the second unique query is sent to the second server. Responses having data are received from the first server and second server. The data from the response is loaded and stored in different tables having a same schema.

One embodiment includes a staging database a presentation database and a data set generation module. The staging database receives configuration files loads extraction parameters and metric parameters from the configuration files extracts data from one or more data sources based on the extraction parameters and generates metrics based on the metric parameters. The presentation database receives metrics from the staging database and aggregates the metrics based on aggregation settings associated with each metric. The data set generation module packages data sets to be displayed. Each data set includes a portion of the aggregated metrics and is defined by metric attributes which are included in the metric parameters.

One embodiment receives configuration files which have metric calculation parameters and display parameters. Two or more sets of data are then retrieved. The data sets are associated with two or more servers based on the configuration files. Each of the two or more servers has data stored in a different schema. Metric data is then generated for each of the two or more servers from the two or more sets of data and the configuration files. The metric data is aggregated for each of the two or more servers and the aggregated metric data is displayed based on the display parameters in the configuration files for each metric.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A flexible and dynamic metrics generation system provides IT computing system metrics. The metrics generation system retrieves IT system health data determines and aggregates metrics from the retrieved data based on user defined parameters and displays the metrics based on user preferences. The metrics generation system is flexible in that it can be changed to extract data from different IT data sources calculate different metric information having a hierarchy of attributes and display a variety of metric data in different formats.

Data extractions calculations and display are performed based on parameters and instructions contained in one or more configuration files. To change how data is processed or displayed by the system involves changing the configuration files rather than system code itself. The configuration files are loaded by one or more data bases and applications of the system. Once the configuration files are loaded the system dynamically changes how it retrieves data processes data and or displays data to an administrator.

The metrics generation system includes a middle tier and a presentation tier. The middle tier includes one or more databases and other modules which extract data from one or more data sources process the extracted data and prepare the processed data to be displayed all based on one or more configuration files loaded by the middle tier modules. The presentation tier receives the processed data and displays the data for a user based on configuration files having display parameters.

Configuration files are used to define tasks for data extraction processing and display set attribute values which define metrics to be calculated and displayed and otherwise configure aspects of the middle tier and presentation tier of the present technology. The configuration files may be in a particular format such as extended markup language XML and may generated by a user manually or through an application in response to user input. Additionally a user may change one or more configuration files at any time before or during monitoring of an IT system. For example in response to changing the configuration files to adjust a particular metric the metrics generation system is updated to adjust the metric processing and display accordingly.

In some embodiments configuration files may be comprised of backend configuration files and display configuration files. Backend configuration files may be used to configure a database layer backend tier which extracts processes and stores data from one or more data sources. The display configuration files may include one or more configuration files used to configure a user interface part of the presentation tier and the data displayed in the user interface.

By using configuration files to specify system operating parameters rather than hard coding parameters into system modules the system is easily expandable flexible and dynamic. For example data captured from monitoring an IT system may be stored in data sources having different database schema. The configuration files may include parameters and instructions to extract data from each server regardless of the schema it uses. The data from the two or more data stores is then loaded into a single schema and processed. Further additional data stores may be easily added by manipulating the configuration files. After processing metrics from any of the data stores may be displayed in a single user interface. This may be achieved by specifying display preferences in the display configuration files for each metric. This is discussed in more detail below.

A metric or measurement sometimes collectively referred to herein as metrics identified by the present technology may be associated with a hierarchy. The hierarchy may have one or more levels of attributes. The attributes may provide more information for the metric or describe a subset of a metric.

The example hierarchy in provides example values for the hierarchy format. The product level is the highest level of the hierarchy and represents the product for which the metric is calculated. The illustrated example for product is Exchange 2003 a server type. In some embodiments no aggregation is done for the product level.

The metric level is the level below the product level and represents the actual metric for which reports are generated. The example metric value in is Exchange Server 2003 availability. In addition to having a value each metric hierarchy may have other information associated with it such as an aggregation type. The aggregation type for a metric determines how data below the metric level are rolled up into higher levels. Types of aggregation may include sum average minimum and maximum of the data points for the metric. The aggregation type for the example in is set to average as indicated by avg. Other types of aggregation methods may be used with the present technology as well.

Each metric level has a number of attribute levels below it most of which are optional. Each attribute level identifies an aspect of the metric which represents a subset of the total data for the metric. For example the optional attribute types illustrated in are forest region domain building and entity server. The example value for each attribute is a North America forest Corp region Redmond domain and RC 4 building. Data may be aggregated for each of these attribute levels levels 4 1 . When aggregating data for a particular level the aggregation type value for the metric level is accessed. In the example hierarchy of aggregating Exchange Server 2003 Availability for all Corp regions would be done by averaging the metrics. The level 0 attribute the last attribute is the server or entity itself. In the example illustrated the level 0 attribute has a value of Exchange Server 7. The metric hierarchy levels including the attribute types and the values for each hierarchy may be defined in one or more backend configuration files.

Configuration files are accessed at step . Accessing the files may include metrics engine retrieving the backend configuration files and providing them to staging database and display engine retrieving display configuration files and providing them to display application .

The data is retrieved or extracted by staging database according to settings and tasks configured based on one or more configuration files. Retrieving data from two or more data stores by staging database is discussed in more detail below with respect to the process of .

After retrieving the data metrics are generated from the retrieved data at step . In some embodiments the metrics are generated according to backend configuration files by staging database . Each metric may have one or more descriptors or other parameters associated with the metric. The metric parameters may be associated with a hierarchy. In some embodiments metric data may be generated for each level of hierarchy for each metric. An example of a schema which describes the levels of a hierarchy associated with a metric is illustrated and discussed in more detail below with respect to . Generating metrics for one or more hierarchy levels from retrieved data is discussed in more detail below with respect to the process of .

Next metrics are aggregated at each hierarchy level by presentation database at step . In some embodiments data may be retrieved from one or more of data sources several times over a period of time. The data retrieved over time is processed into metrics and aggregated into a table format. Metrics may be aggregated for each hierarchy level or metric attribute type for a particular metric. The aggregated data is stored a presentation database . An example of a schema which describes tables in which metrics may be aggregated is illustrated in and discussed in more detail below.

After aggregating metrics sets of data are packaged for display at step . In some embodiments the sets of data to display are packaged into a file which can be accessed and processed by display application . The file may be compressed or otherwise generated to efficiently contain a set of data to display through user interface . In some embodiments the set of data may be packaged as a three dimensional data cube. In this embodiment the aggregated data is sent to data set generation module which generates the data cube. Sets of data may be placed in a data cube according to a cube schema. An exemplary cube schema is illustrated in and discussed in more detail below.

Sets of data are displayed by display application at step . Display application receives sets of data from data set generation module and displays the data as driven by display engine . The display parameters and settings for displaying the data are derived from display configuration files . Display application provides the data in user interface . The data may be provided as one or more metrics associated with the health of one or more IT systems. Displaying data in step is discussed in more detail with respect to the process of .

Steps and represent steps implemented as part of a presentation layer of the present technology. In some embodiments the presentation layer can be separated by businesses or application. Thus there may be more than one display mechanism for different types of displayed data and information.

Attribute configuration files are generated at step . In some embodiments the attributes data may define a hierarchy associated with each metric wherein each hierarchy may have a number of levels comprised of attributes. An example of an XML configuration file which specifies attributes is shown below.

The attributes XML configuration file above specifies attribute class names of business unit service type and region. Each attribute class has attribute values and display names. The BusinessUnit attribute class has values of BusinessUnit1 BusinessUnit2 and BusinessUnit3 which are displayed as BU1 BU2 and BU3. The Service attribute class has values of Service1 Service2 and Service3 which are displayed as Platinum Gold and silver respectfully. The Type attribute class has values of type1 type2 type3 and type4 which are displayed as Bridgehead Gateway Frontend and Mailbox. Finally the Region attribute class has values of Region1 Region2 and Region3 which are displayed as Corp WinDeploy and WinSE.

Server identification configuration files and server query configuration files are generated at step . Server identification configuration files identify a name and location information for a source of data. An example of a configuration file that contains database connection data is below.

The database connection configuration file above specifies attributes of data source identifications IDs each of which is associated with a database server name and database name. For example the first data source specified has a data source ID of MOM EVENTDATA TRANSFER. This data source is on the data server named abc momrep 123 and the database name SystemCenterReporting. The third data source specified has a data source ID of LDAP DATA TRANSFER is located on database server called SLADemo and in a database named IIS LDAPDatabase. 

The query configuration file includes a query identification portion and data mapping portion for each query. The query identification portion includes the name of the data source to query the type of data to query the query to send to the data source and data mapping information for the query. The data mapping information indicates mappings of the retrieved data to display headings.

Hierarchy level configuration files are generated at step . In some embodiments each server is associated with one or more attributes. For example a server may contain mailbox data and be located in Los Angeles. Thus the server could be associated with a geographical attribute of California because Los Angeles is in California. A portion of a level group configuration file which indicates levels of a hierarchy associated with one or more metrics is below.

The level group configuration file portion above indicates levels of a hierarchy for a metrics. In particular the level group configuration file identifies a base level level number 4 of EXCHANGE L5 BRIDGEHEAD. The next level is identified as a region of CORP. The next level level 3 is identified as a forest level attribute having a value of NORTHAMERICA. The last level is a domain attribute having a value of REDMOND. After identifying the level types availability configuration and weight information are identified. Though attribute levels of region forest and domain are illustrated in the above example any attribute type can be used.

Metric configuration files are generated at step . Metric configuration files may identify a particular metric the events at which it is measured how the data for the metric is provided how to provide information regarding metric measurements as opposed to an aggregation of data how to aggregate the metric calculations and other information. An example of a portion of a metric configuration file is below.

The metric XML configuration file above defines a first metric EXHANGEROLE MAILBOX AVAILABILITY and a second metric EXHANGEROLE FRONTEND AVAILABILITY within metric group MG1. Each metric is associated with information regarding the metric display name the trend of the metric whether the metric tends to increase over time or decrease how the metric is aggregated the type of metric outage information indicating the start and end of an outage for a metric and other information. The trend TrendType of the metric is used for comparison against a target set for that metric. If TrendType is set to IncreasingIsBetter then a given metric value greater than the target will be considered green or above SLA . For TrendType DecreasingIsBetter a given value will be green if it has a value below the assigned target.

Other backend configuration files are generated at step . Other backend configuration files may identify metric targets form configuration files that provide a list of all possible values for a hierarchy and other files.

Display configuration files are generated at step . In some embodiments several types of display configuration files may be used including weekly measures weekly metrics monthly measures monthly measures Display XML total measure and total metrics display configuration files. Each display configuration file may include an identification of the particular display data configuration information over which the data applies identification of the metric to be displayed and other information. An example of a home weekly measures scorecard configuration file is below.

The home weekly measures scorecard configuration file above identifies the metrics to be displayed on a home page or start page for the Exchange data source. The metrics displayed include EXCHANGE NUMBER OF MAILBOX EXCHANGE AVERAGE MAILBOX SIZE EXCHANGE TOTAL MAILBOX CONTENT EXCHANGE NUMBEROF MAX USERS LARGEST EXCHANGE SERVER EXCHANGE SMTP INTERNET MSG RECEIVED and EXCHANGE SMTP EXCHANGE MSG DELIVERED. 

Other XML configuration files are generated at step . The additional XML configuration files may provide more information regarding data extraction processing aggregation or display or provide other information for configuring framework . For example data set processing tasks may be generated which generate and provide data sets to be displayed from aggregated metrics. After XML configuration files have been configured the files are stored at step . The XML configuration files may be stored on local memory of computer at a location over a network and accessible to computer or some other location.

The configuration files discussed with respect to the process of are for examples of different types of files that may be used to configure a metrics processing and display system such as that of framework . Other and or additional configuration files may be used to configure the system as well.

Next extraction process tasks are generated at step . The extraction process tasks may generate a request for one or more data sources such as an SQL server. The query may be generated from backend configuration files such as one or more database connections configuration files and one or more query configuration files discussed above. The extraction tasks and related data are generated and stored at staging database . Generating the tasks may include creating tables and or allocating memory in which to store extracted data within staging database . Examples of schema for storing data in staging database are illustrated in and discussed in more detail below.

Dimension data load tasks are generated at step . Dimension data load tasks handle loading of the extracted data into tables of staging database . The tables are configured using the schema illustrated and described below with respect to . For example dimension data load tasks may include loading extracted data into one or more hierarchy levels of a metric as described by the outbound dimension level tables of the staging database schema.

Next measure calculation tasks are generated at step . The measure calculation tasks may describe how to calculate a measured value of an element. For example a measure calculation task may determine the total number of times that a condition or event occurs such as the number of times a connection attempt is blocked. The measure calculation task indicates the data that is needed to determine the measure and where the store the result of the measure. Availability calculation tasks are generated at step . Similar to measure calculations an availability calculation task may determine the availability of an element as a percentage of a series of data points having a certain value. For example Exchange Mailbox availability may be determined as a percentage of time that the service is available over a period of one month. Next the displayed data set tasks are generated at step . Displayed data set tasks may access generated data cubes to be displayed in user interface by display application indicate how user interface should be provided indicate the data to provide in the interface and perform other tasks.

One or more queries are created for one or more data stores based on the backend configuration files at step . The one or more queries may indicate a data store location data server name database name the data to retrieve and optionally other information. The queries may be generated from the extraction process tasks generated at step backend configuration files staging database settings and other information. In some embodiments the queries may be generated as SQL queries.

The generated queries generated at step are sent to one or more of data stores at step . Once a query is sent to a data store the data store receives the query processes the query generates a response and sends the response to staging database . Processing the query may include retrieving data from one or more databases within the queried server and packaging the retrieved data in a query response. For example the response may include IT health data that can be used to generate availability and measurement metrics to be displayed in user interface . Next one or more responses are received from the data sources at step . The query responses are received by staging database . In some embodiments a query may be sent periodically such as every fifteen minutes every hour once a day or some other time period. As a result a corresponding response can be received from the data source for each query sent.

The received response data is stored into tables associated within staging database according to the staging database schema at step . For example the data may be stored in an inbound measures table or an inbound event table. Once stored the extraction of data from data stores is complete.

Data is retrieved from staging database according to the accessed XML configuration file at step . In some embodiments the data is retrieved by measure calculation and availability calculation tasks generated at step and step of the process of . The retrieved data may include data extracted from data sources and needed to calculate a metric.

Metrics are calculated according to the accessed XML configuration file at step . The calculated metrics may include availability of a particular web page a measure of events associated with the web page or some other metric. In some embodiments the metric may be calculated by the measure calculation and availability calculation tasks. The calculated metrics are then stored in presentation database at step . The metrics may be stored in tables corresponding to the staging base schema of . For example the metrics may be stored in tables having a format described by the outbound dimension level schema of the schema of .

User interface is configured with default settings and parameters at step . The default settings and parameters may be stored in display application and relate to the metrics to display the number of columns and rows to display and other default settings. Display configuration files are then retrieved at step . The display configuration files may relate to weekly monthly and total metrics and measurements in addition to other display configuration files.

Selected data sets or cubes are then retrieved at step . The data sets are retrieved from data set generation module by display application . The data sets are selected based on data contained within XML configuration files and data determined to be displayed through user interface . In some embodiments the selected data sets are retrieved as one or more cubes from data set generation module by display application . Display engine may drive display application to request the cubes from data set generation module .

Next user interface is configured according to the display configuration files at step . The configuration of user interface may include how to display data where in the interface to display data the look and feel of the interface and other preferences. In some embodiments user interface may also be configured by displayed data set tasks generated at step in the process of . Finally the data sets or cubes are displayed in user interface at step . Data is displayed by populating the user interface with data included in the data sets data cubes retrieved from data set generation module . Examples of user interface are illustrated in .

The outbound dimension tables of the staging database schema include OutboundDimConfig OutboundDimProduct OutboundDimMetric OutboundDimLevel4 OutboundDimLevel3 OutboundDimLevel2 OutboundDimLevel1 and OutboundDimLevel0Entity tables. The OutboundDimConfig table describes the hierarchy for a particular metric the OutboundDimMetric table describes properties of a particular metric and the OutboundDimProduct table describes a product associated with a particular metric. The OutboundDim level tables describe each hierarchy level for a particular metric. As discussed above when extracted data is processed into metrics the metric data is placed into the OutboundDimLevel files corresponding to the generated metric.

The other staging database schema tables include sysdiagrams TempSLATargetData and OutageDaywiseData. These tables describe the display identifications in which a metric is displayed in service level agreement SLA data for a particular metric and outage data for a particular metric respectfully.

The dimension data tables include DimConfig DimMetric DimProduct and DimLevel4 DimLevel0 tables. The DimConfig table includes configuration information for a dimension data. The DimMetric table includes the name aggregation type measure properties and other information for a metric. The DimProduct table and DimLevel tables include the actual name and display name for a product and hierarchy levels attributes associated with a metric.

The other tables include DimDate sysdiagrams MetricFact and CubeWaterMark tables. The DimDate table includes identifications of time periods associated with measurement data such as weeks days or months during which the data was collected the SysDiagram table includes display identification in which a metric is displayed the MetricFact table includes data regarding SLA targets for a metric and the CubeWaterMark table includes cube identification information for cubes to contain a particular measure data.

Display selection window may list a number of servers or systems data available for the server and or system and a list of attributes for the data. The systems data type and attributes displayed in window are derived from display configuration files . A user may select one or more of the attributes to view metrics associated with the server or system having the selected attributes. For example display selection window illustrates a system of Exchange with metrics measures outages and MPR data able to be selected for display. Window illustrates that metrics is selected as well as attributes of By Month and YTD. 

Data attribute portion lists the data being displayed such as a metric measure or other data as well as a hierarchy of attributes for the particular data. The displayed data attributes and hierarchy relationship of attributes is defined by backend configuration files. The display of the data and attributes hierarchy in data attribute portion is derived from display configuration files . In some embodiments the metric id is in the display which is a reference to the MetricGroup xml file that contains the metric display name. Display configuration files may also define the number of periods to display e.g. 3 weeks months etc and the number of decimal places.

The illustrated data is Exchange Data Availability with first level attributes of Corp Exchange and WINSE. A second level of attributes for Corp are NORTHAMERCIA APJ AND EMEA. A third level of attributes for NORTHAMERICA includes REDMOND and NORTHAMERICA.

Data value portion includes availability data for each level of metric for different periods of time. The periods of time are specified in various configuration files and schema tables. The data includes a target set of values for each attribute value and actual data values of each metric for different months of July June and May. When an actual availability meets or exceeds a target a circle or other ok icon may be displayed next to the data. When an actual availability does not meet a target a diamond or other caution icon may be displayed next to the data. For example the Exchange mailbox availability for CORP has a target value of 99.990 had a July availability of 99.999 which is associated with an ok icon a June availability of 99.989 which is associated with a caution icon and a May availability of 99.984 which is associated with an ok icon.
