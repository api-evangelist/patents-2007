title: Method and system for copying a snapshot tree
abstract: Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to an instant snapshot-tree-copy operation that, when directed to an existing snapshot tree, generates a data-structure framework for a copy of the existing snapshot tree that can be immediately accessed while a background-copy process copies data from the existing snapshot tree to the copy snapshot tree. The background-copy process copies data from the existing snapshot tree to the copy snapshot tree in top-down fashion, from the source logical device through each of the snapshot logical devices. While copying each logical device, the background-copy process sequentially copies data-storage units from a corresponding logical device of the existing snapshot tree to the copy-snapshot-tree logical device, making sure to adjust chains of dependencies within the copy snapshot tree to reflect modifications to the snapshot copy tree that occur independently from the background-copy process. A host computer may immediately access the copy snapshot tree, both for READ and WRITE access, even before completion of the background-copy process.

The present invention is related to mass storage systems that provide logical device based data storage interfaces to accessing host computers that include snapshot operations and in particular to a method and system for providing an instant copy operation for making a copy of a snapshot tree.

Mass storage devices and mass storage systems have evolved during the past 60 years as rapidly and profoundly if not more rapidly and profoundly than computer processors and electronic memories. Initially mass storage devices were either incorporated within or directly connected to computer systems for exclusive access by the computer systems in which they were included. Later dual ported mass storage devices that could support connections to two or more computer systems were developed in order to provide for more reliable data storage within multi computer systems. Techniques for concurrent access to mass storage devices by multiple computers were developed as well as additional techniques for using redundantly stored data to increase the reliability and fault tolerance of mass storage devices. With the advent of computer networking computer systems became capable of accessing remote mass storage devices via servers that managed the mass storage devices on behalf of accessing host computers. More recently and continuing to the present time autonomous mass storage systems have been developed to allow computers to access the mass storage systems directly through network communications. These autonomous mass storage systems often feature redundant controllers and redundant internal communications paths and store data redundantly according to one or more of the various RAID schemes to provide highly available and highly fault tolerant data storage. Presently there is a wide range of available mass storage systems for use in computer systems and networked computer environments.

Mass storage systems generally provide a logical device based data storage interface to accessing host computers. Host computers create store data to and retrieve data from logical devices. Each logical device comprises a set of consecutively addressable data storage units. For example a logical device may be considered by the host computer as comprising a linear array of data blocks that include either a fixed or a variable number of bytes words or another smallest granularity unit of data storage. Mass storage systems also generally provide various management and administrative operations to host computers including a snapshot operation. A snapshot operation generates a logical copy of the contents of a logical device at a fixed point in time. The logical copy is contained in a snapshot logical device. Once a snapshot operation has been directed to a logical device the logical device may continue to be accessed by host computers and modified by WRITE operations. Should at a future point in time a host computer wish to restore the logical device to the data state at the point in time at which a snapshot operation was directed to the logical device the host computer can direct a RESTORE command to the logical device specifying the snapshot logical device that corresponds to the point in time or the time point. Snapshot operations can be issued one after another at fixed points in time in order to provide a set of potential restore points to allow a host computer to restore a logical device to the data state that the logical device had at any of the restore points represented by snapshot logical devices generated by the snapshot operations.

The set of snapshots or snapshot logical devices generated for a source logical device along with the source logical device together comprise a snapshot tree. A host computer can restore the source logical device to the data state that the source logical device had at any in point in time represented by a snapshot in the snapshot tree. In general the snapshots in the snapshot tree are not full copies of the source logical device but contain only differential data sufficient to restore the logical device to the data state at the time represented by the snapshot. The snapshots within the snapshot tree are generally interdependent and often during a restore operation a number of different snapshots within the snapshot tree need to be accessed in order to restore the source logical device to a previous data state. The entire snapshot tree is therefore a rather complex set of interdependent somewhat special types of logical devices. While current mass storage systems provide snapshot and restore operations current mass storage systems do not provide a convenient means for managing the entire set of source and snapshot logical devices that together compose a snapshot tree. Researchers developers manufacturers vendors and users of mass storage systems thus recognize a need to continue to develop and provide new and improved methods and systems for managing snapshot trees within a complex mass storage system.

Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to an instant snapshot tree copy operation that when directed to an existing snapshot tree generates a data structure framework for a copy of the existing snapshot tree that can be immediately accessed while a background copy process copies data from the existing snapshot tree to the copy snapshot tree. In one embodiment of the present invention he background copy process copies data from the existing snapshot tree to the copy snapshot tree in top down fashion from the source logical device through each of the snapshot logical devices. While copying each logical device the background copy process sequentially copies data storage units from a corresponding logical device of the existing snapshot tree to the copy snapshot tree logical device making sure to adjust chains of dependencies within the copy snapshot tree to reflect modifications to the snapshot copy tree that occur independently from the background copy process. A host computer may immediately access the copy snapshot tree both for READ and WRITE access even before completion of the background copy process.

The present invention is directed to a method and system for instant snapshot tree copy within a mass storage system. In a first subsection below an exemplary mass storage system is discussed to provide a suitable foundation for the following discussion of the present invention. In the second subsection details of the snapshot operation and snapshot trees are discussed to complete the foundation information for discussion of the present invention. Finally in a third subsection embodiments of the present invention are discussed.

As one example of the complexities of mass storage systems most mass storage systems employ one of various techniques of redundant data storage in order to increase the reliability and fault tolerance of the mass storage system. In one redundant data storage scheme the mass storage system mirrors mass storage devices so that each data block within a logical device is stored twice on two different mass storage devices within the mass storage system. A second redundant data storage scheme is referred to as erasure coding redundancy. Erasure coding redundancy is somewhat more complicated than mirror scheme. Erasure coding redundancy often employ Reed Solomon encoding techniques used for error control coding of communications messages and other digital data transferred through noisy channels. These error control coding techniques are specific examples of binary linear codes. Data blocks are striped across multiple mass storage devices along with additional blocks containing parity or checksum data. Depending on the specific error control coding technique and the amount of parity data stored for each block of data failure of one two or more mass storage devices in the set of mass storage devices across which data blocks are striped can be accommodated without data loss since the surviving mass storage devices contain sufficient data and parity information to completely recover those data and parity blocks lost due to failure of the one two or more mass storage devices. The second redundant data storage scheme is somewhat more complex than mirroring but is much more efficient with respect to the amount of data that needs to be stored redundantly in order to recover from particular mass storage device failure scenarios.

A common high level data storage interface that can be provided by both individual mass storage systems and by mass storage system aggregators servers is next described. This data storage interface is but one example of many possible general data storage interfaces that can be provided by mass storage systems. Rather than attempt to discuss the present invention with respect to all possible data storage interfaces the present invention is described below with respect to the general data storage interface now discussed with reference to .

The LDADs shown in may in many cases map to individual mass storage systems. Thus a mass storage system aggregator server may provide the general data storage interface shown in to host computers and may map each LDAD provided to host computers to a different mass storage system. However a mass storage system may also choose to provide a general data storage interface that includes two or more LDADs and a mass storage system aggregator server may map a given LDAD to multiple mass storage systems or may map two or more LDADs to a single mass storage system. Logical devices are consecutive sequences of addressable data storage units. In the general data storage interface shown in an Rstore object is data storage space allocated on a number of mass storage devices within a mass storage system according to a redundant data storage scheme such as mirroring or an erasure coding based redundant data storage scheme. For example an Rstore may be several gigabytes of data striped across a number of mass storage devices along with parity information. The Rseg objects are smaller granularity partitions of the Rstore space. For example each Rseg may contain one megabyte of data storage space. The Rstore and Rseg data objects conveniently abstract the contents of a logical device from the particular redundant data storage based scheme used for storing the data contained in the logical device. The particular sizes of the Rstore and Rseg data objects are not relevant to discussion of the present invention. The particular redundant data storage based data storage schemes that are used for storing data are also not relevant.

Various data structures are employed within a mass storage system or mass storage aggregator server both subsequently referred to as mass storage systems for managing the data storage objects within a mass storage system. One possible set of data structures is next described. illustrates a logical device table associated with each LDAD for representing the logical devices within an LDAD. The logical device table includes a number of entries each entry corresponding to a different logical device. Each entry of the logical device table contains or references a data structure that includes a number of different fields that describe the logical device represented by the entry. In the first entry of the logical device table is shown to reference a data structure containing a number of different fields that describe the logical device represented by the first entry of the logical device table. One field references an L2MAP which contains detailed information about the contents of the logical device. The data structure also contains source and destination pointers and that point back into the logical device table to indicate the source and destination for restore operations. The data structure further includes a successor pointer and a predecessor pointer that also refer to entries in the logical device table as well as an ir source pointer used during restore operations . The successor and predecessor references allow logical devices to be linked together into snapshot trees. Use of the successor and predecessor references and is described further below. The data structure may contain many additional fields that describe various aspects of or current operations performed on logical devices.

Each RSD data structure contains metadata describing the Rstore which the RSD represents a representation of the physical segments onto which the Rstore is mapped and information about each of the Rsegs contained within the Rstore. For purposes of describing the present invention each Rseg is described in part in the RSD by three single bit fields. For example as shown in the first Rseg described in RSD is described in part by 1 an ss bit that indicate whether the Rseg depends on data stored in a corresponding Rseg of a successor logical device 2 an sp bit that indicates whether or not the Rseg depends on data stored in a corresponding Rseg of a predecessor logical device and 3 an ir bit used during restore operations. The use of the ss and sp bits is described in greater detail below as is the use of the ir bit and ir source field during instant snap tree copy operations. Again it should be noted that many different possible data structures can be used to represent logical devices within a mass storage system. The data structures discussed with reference to provide a convenient foundation or exemplary data structure scheme for discussion of embodiments of the present invention below. However the present invention may be practiced on or applied to many different data structure representations of LDADs and logical devices within many different types of mass storage systems. Even for the described data structures many different implementations and layouts are possible and the present invention may be practiced on or applied to any of the many possible implementations and layouts.

Next a snapshot operation is described with reference to . use similar illustration conventions described below with respect to .

Snapshot operations are quite useful for data management applications. For example a relational database management system RDMS may frequently at a fixed interval in time or following fixed amounts of accesses or activity take snapshots of one or more logical devices within which the RDMS stores tables views and other data. Should for some reason one or more of the logical devices become corrupted due to problems at the RDMS level the RDMS can restore the logical devices to successively more distant points in time from the current time until a version of the logical devices is obtained in which there is no data corruption. The RDMS can then use separate log files stored within separate logical devices to re execute intervening transactions in order to bring the state of the RDMS up to a most recent state prior to detection of the data corruption. Snapshot operations also find use in data archiving and other applications.

The snapshot operation illustrated in is space efficient. Rsegs are allocated and filled with data in snapshot logical devices only when necessary. Thus the snapshot logical devices and are sparse and essentially contain data state differences that occur in the source logical device from the time that the snapshot logical device is created until the time that a successor snapshot logical device is created. It should be noted that snapshot logical devices can be separately accessed in both READ and WRITE operations. For example snapshot logical device can be accessed to write the contents of Rseg . If the contents of Rseg are altered by a WRITE operation then the current contents of Rseg are first copied into a newly allocated Rseg corresponding to Rseg in snapshot logical device since snapshot logical device depends on snapshot logical device with respect to that Rseg. Only when the contents of Rseg have been copied to snapshot logical device can the contents of Rseg be modified in order to maintain logical consistency within the snapshot tree comprising source logical device and snapshot logical devices and .

Were a RESTIORE command to be directed to the source logical device to retired the source logical device to the data state at the point in time represented by the first snapshot logical device data from all three snapshot logical devices would be needed. For example data for the first two Rsegs A and B is found by following ss bit encoded dependency chains in the second snapshot logical device while data for the third Rseg C is found by following an ss bit encoded dependency chain in the third snapshot logical device . By contrast data for the fourth fifth and sixth Rsegs D E and F is found in the first snapshot logical device. In other words to restore the source logical device to a previous data state the restore operation starts with a snapshot logical device corresponding to that data state and locates the data for each Rseg either in that snapshot logical device when it is present or in successor logical devices when data is not present in the snapshot logical device corresponding to the data state to be restored.

For various reasons it would be desirable to provide a snapshot tree copy operation. illustrates a snapshot tree copy operation. As shown in a snapshot tree in a first LDAD needs to be copied to a second LDAD . Currently mass storage systems do not provide a snapshot tree copy operation. At best a system administrator would need to employ restore operations in order to transform the snapshot logical devices with a snapshot tree into stand alone logical devices and then copy each of the separate logical devices. However such a restore based copy of a snapshot tree does not produce an equivalent snapshot tree but instead produces a sequence of stand alone logical devices that reflect the data state captured at particular points in time represented by the original snapshot logical devices. Moreover the restore based snapshot tree copy results in significant expansion in the amount of data storage space needed to store the copy snapshot tree. The original snapshot tree is efficiently stored as illustrated in . However using a restore based snapshot tree copy operation the resulting copy snapshot tree would essentially consist of four different complete versions of the source logical device rather than containing the sparse snapshot logical devices contained in the original snapshot tree .

The present invention provides a true snapshot tree copy operation as illustrated in that preserves the logical structure of the original snapshot tree. The snapshot tree copy operation of the present invention is first discussed below using the example snapshot logical tree shown in . Following this discussion control flow diagrams are provided to illustrate a snapshot tree copy that represents one embodiment of the present invention.

Once the data structure framework for the copy snapshot tree has been created as shown in the copy snapshot tree can be immediately written to and read from even though it does not yet contain data. A background copy process is launched in order to copy data from the source snapshot tree into the copy snapshot tree while the copy snapshot tree is essentially live and accessible. The background copy process is illustrated in . The background copy process considers each logical device within the copy snapshot tree in order starting with the logical device corresponding to the source logical device in the source snapshot tree. In alternative embodiments the Rsegs of the copy snapshot tree may be processed in different orders with logical devices for example of the snapshot tree processes in parallel. Thus in in the first step in the background copy process the first Rseg of the first logical device of the copy snapshot tree is considered. Initially the ir bit associated with this Rseg was cleared as shown in . This means that data for the Rseg must be copied from the source snapshot tree . Therefore the contents of the corresponding Rseg in the source snapshot tree are copied into a newly allocated Rseg within the copy snapshot tree and the ir bit is set to 1 to indicate that the Rseg has been processed by the background copy process. As shown in this process continues Rseg by Rseg and results in the first logical device within the copy snapshot tree being fully allocated and containing data copied from the source snapshot tree .

Next as shown in attention turns to the second logical device in the copy snapshot tree . The Rseg in the source snapshot tree corresponding to the first Rseg in the second logical device of the copy snapshot tree does not contain data as indicated by the ss bit being set. Therefore no data is copied into Rseg but the ir bit associated with Rseg is set to indicate that Rseg has been considered by the background copy process. Consideration by the background copy process of the first Rseg in the second logical device of the copy snapshot tree with an associated ir bit that is not set and an associated ss bit that is not set results in allocation of a new physical storage space for the Rseg of the second logical device and copying of data from the corresponding Rseg from the source snapshot tree into the newly allocated Rseg . As shown in this process continues until all of the Rsegs in the second logical device of the copy snapshot tree have been considered. Note that as a result of consideration by the background process all of the Rsegs containing data in the corresponding logical device in the source snapshot tree resulted in allocation of Rsegs in the second logical device in the copy snapshot tree and copying of the contents of the Rsegs in the source snapshot tree into the corresponding Rsegs of the second logical device of the copy snapshot tree .

Next as shown in the background process considers the third logical device in the copy snapshot tree and begins to copy data as needed from the corresponding logical device of the source snapshot tree . illustrates completion of the background copy process after which the contents of the copy snapshot tree are identical to the contents of the source snapshot tree . Of course actual numerical contents of the data structures representing the copy snapshot tree are not identical to the numerical contents of the data structures representing the source snapshot tree since for example the detailed information within RSD data structures within the data structure framework describing the copy snapshot tree may be quite different from corresponding details in the RSD data structures for the source snapshot tree . These differences reflect a generally different mapping of the logical structure of the copy snapshot tree to physical devices than the mapping of logical structures of the source snapshot tree to physical storage. However the copy snapshot tree is logically identical to the source snapshot tree .

Next a series of control flow diagrams are presented to illustrate a method embodiment of the present invention. is a top level control flow diagram for the instant snapshot tree copy operation that represents one embodiment of the present invention. In step the command receives an indication of the snapshot tree to copy and an indication of the domain in which the copy is to be located. As discussed below the RAID scheme used for the copy snapshot tree may be specified in an additional parameter to be different from that of the source snapshot tree. The snapshot tree to be copied is referred to as the source snapshot tree and the copy snapshot tree is referred to as the target snapshot tree. Next in step the source snapshot tree is frozen since the source snapshot tree cannot be modified during the embodiment of the instant snapshot tree copy discussed with reference to . However as discussed below the target snapshot tree is essentially immediately available once a data structure framework is created for the target snapshot tree. In certain embodiments WRITEs and READs directed to the source snapshot tree may be accumulated for later application to the source snapshot tree. Next in step a data structure framework for the target snapshot tree is created in the domain or LDAD in which the target snapshot tree resides. This involves creating and at least partially populating entries in the logical device table L2MAPs LMAPs and RSD data structures. illustrates creation of a data structure framework. Next in step all of the share bits including the ss and sp bits of the source snapshot tree are duplicated in the target snapshot tree. The ir bits for the Rsegs of the target snapshot tree are cleared and the ir source fields for the target snapshot tree are initialized with pointers to corresponding logical devices in the source snapshot tree as discussed above with reference to . Next in step the background copy process is launched. In step the target snapshot tree is made active or in other words available for READs WRITEs and other accesses. In step the snapshot tree copy routine waits for the background copy process to finish before unfreezing the source snapshot tree in step and optionally applying any accumulated READs WRITEs and other operations which have been directed to the source snapshot tree during the snapshot tree copy operation. Alternatively the snapshot tree copy routine can provide a callback reference to the background copy process so that when the background copy process finishes the background copy process can call the callback routine to unfreeze the source snapshot tree and optionally apply accumulated READs WRITEs and other such operations.

When the target Rseg for the WRITE operation has already been considered by the background copy process as determined in step then the WRITE can be immediately directed to the target Rseg in step . Then if the ss bit associated with the target Rseg is set as determined in step the corresponding Rseg in a successor logical device within the target snapshot tree needs to be located so that the sp bit of the corresponding Rseg in the successor logical device can be cleared in step . The target Rseg s ss bit is also cleared in step . Steps and break the dependency between the target Rseg and the corresponding Rseg of the successor logical device. If the sp bit associated with the target Rseg is set to 1 as determined in step then the sp bit associated with the target Rseg is cleared in step . Step partially breaks the dependency between the target and the corresponding Rseg of the predecessor logical device. Partial removal of the dependency alerts the background copy process that the background copy process needs to find data for the corresponding Rseg of the predecessor logical device in the source snapshot tree in steps and in .

Finally provides a simple control flow diagram for executing a READ operation directed to the target snapshot tree during execution of the background copy process. In step the target Rseg for the READ is located in the target snapshot tree. If the ir bit associated with the target Rseg is set as determined in step then the READ is satisfied by accessing the corresponding Rseg in the target snapshot tree in step . Otherwise the READ is executed with respect to the target Rseg in the source snapshot tree in step .

While the instant snapshot tree copy operation has been discussed above reference to a particular data storage interface and a particular set of data structures that describe logical devices within the data storage interface the instant snapshot tree copy operation of the present invention can be implemented in any of a large number of different types of mass storage systems using many different data storage interfaces and different data structures describing data objects stored via the data storage interface with a variety of different software and firmware implementations. In the described embodiment the target snapshot tree is essentially immediately available for READ and WRITE operations even while the background copy process is executing but the source snapshot tree is not available during the execution of the background copy process. In alternative more complex embodiments both the source snapshot tree and the target snapshot tree can be made essentially instantly available for continuing READ and WRITE operations. As with any software implementation careful use of critical sections needs to be made in routines that access data structures such as in the background copy process and in routines that carry out READ and WRITE operations directed to either the source or target snapshot tree during the snapshot tree copy operation. For example critical sections in the code are necessary to avoid the background copy process considering a target copy tree Rseg just after a WRITE operation directed to the target Rseg has begun to be carried out.

The instant snapshot tree copy operation provides a number of advantages and desirable features to system administrators to automated logical device management routines and to designers and developers of data storage interfaces and mass storage systems. First snapshot trees can be copied in one operation resulting in a logically equivalent snapshot tree that can be placed in a different LDAD from the LDAD containing the source snapshot tree. The copy snapshot tree is immediately available for READ WRITE and other access operations. Moreover a snapshot tree copy can be implemented to use a different redundant data storage scheme for Rstores of the copy snapshot tree than used for the source snapshot copy tree. As discussed above the instant snapshot tree copy operation of the present invention is not dependent on the detailed information contained in the RSD data structures that specify the redundant data storage scheme. The data structure framework initially created for the copy snapshot tree can therefore be initialized to specify any of the possible redundant data storage schemes.

Although the present invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments it is not intended that the invention be limited to these embodiments. Modifications within the spirit of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example many different implementations of the instant snapshot tree copy operation that represents an embodiment of the present invention are possible with variations in a variety of different implementation parameters such as modular organization data structures control structures programming languages implementation platforms and other such parameters. While relatively small snapshot trees are discussed in the examples above the instant snapshot tree copy operation of the present invention may be carried out on snapshot trees of arbitrary size. In the embodiment of the present invention discussed above particular fields in address fields associated with Rsegs in the RSD data structure are employed for bookkeeping during the instant snapshot tree operation. In alternative embodiments separate data structures could be used for this purpose or in yet additional embodiments alternative bit fields and reference fields in the Rseg and Rseg like data structures or in other data structures may be employed. As discussed above the instant snapshot tree copy operation that represents an embodiment of the present invention may be implemented in a wide variety of different types of mass storage systems using different architectures data storage interfaces and data structure representations of data objects stored within the mass storage systems.
