The invention was made with Government support under Contract Number F33615 00 D 3052 DO 0059 awarded by the Air Force. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

Embodiments relate to the field of aircraft construction and more specifically to a composite fuselage section a system and a method including a composite fabric structure with rigid member.

Various assemblies and methods of assembly exist for composite structures which require opposing mold halves adapted to form the shape and contour of opposite sides of the composite structure. Many require additional assembly operations to fasten components together. To form an aircraft fuselage using composites a skin is first formed which typically requires tooling for both the inner mold line and the outer mold line. Then the skin is fastened to longitudinal stringers and transverse frame members. Joining the skin to the stringers and frames requires multiple fasteners. In addition the role an aircraft fuselage will play for example if used for a bomber aircraft verses an attack aircraft etc. will further dictate individualized tooling requirements.

There exists a need to reduce manufacturing tooling requirements the number of parts for final assembly and the number of assembly operations.

The various embodiments may provide a composite structure and a manufacturing process for manufacturing a composite structure for example a composite fuselage section. The structure and process may use one or more rigid members such as but not limited to carbon rods supported by core supports at a distance from the outer mold line fabric lay up. The rigid member may be wrapped with a fabric the fabric may extend to and may be stitched to the mold line fabric lay up. The rigid member may provide a support structure for the fabric during a cure cycle and when cured may form the webbing stringer elements of the structure. The rigid member may provide a support element during processing that may eliminate the need for inner mold line tooling which would otherwise be required to maintain the shape of the structure. Embodiments may reduce manufacturing costs and improve part quality as the key structural elements and may be cured in one operation versus being cured separately and then mechanically fastened together.

Embodiments may provide a composite structure including a first fabric a second fabric a substantially elongate and substantially rigid first member spaced apart from and coupled with the first fabric via the second fabric and a resin substantially infused into the first fabric and the second fabric and substantially encapsulating the first member to form a unitary structure. The second fabric may be stitched to the first fabric along one or two seams which may be each substantially parallel with the first member. A portion of the first fabric between the two seams may be disposed to form a loop over the first member to couple the first member with the first fabric. A tightening stitch may be disposed through two locations on the second fabric adjacent the first member. A wrapping portion may be defined on the second fabric between the two locations and the tightening stitch may be adapted to tighten the wrapping portion over the first member.

A second member may be disposed transverse to the first member and may be coupled with the first fabric via a third fabric. The resin may also be substantially infused into the second fabric and may substantially encapsulate the second member. The second member and the third fabric may also form part of the unitary structure.

In certain embodiments the unitary structure of the composite structure may form at least part of an aircraft fuselage. The first member may be oriented substantially parallel with a longitudinal axis of the fuselage and the first fabric with the infused resin may be adapted to form a skin of the aircraft fuselage. The second member may form at least part of a cross sectional frame member of the aircraft fuselage.
