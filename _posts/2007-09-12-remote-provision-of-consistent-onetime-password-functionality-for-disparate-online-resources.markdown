title: Remote provision of consistent one-time password functionality for disparate on-line resources
abstract: Consistent one-time password (OTP) functionality is provided from a presentation server to secure various on-line resources. A seed file can be provided to or created by a service provider for execution as part of a hosted page displayed at a client to a user. A presentation server receives a call from the seed file. A user interface widget can be initialized at the presentation server in response to the call from the seed file. The widget can be displayed as part of the remotely hosted Web page so that the user perceives the UI widget to be embedded in the page as viewed on the client computer system. Security for the interaction between the servers can be provided through use of security assertion markup language (SAML).
