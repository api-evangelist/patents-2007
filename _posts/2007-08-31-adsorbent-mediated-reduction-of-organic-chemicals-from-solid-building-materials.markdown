title: Adsorbent mediated reduction of organic chemicals from solid building materials
abstract: A method of removing pollutants from building materials using an externally applied adsorbent. The adsorbent has a high affinity to common pollutant chemicals. The pollutants are transferred from the contaminated microporous building materials onto the adsorbent until sufficient amounts of pollutant chemicals are reduced to make the building materials acceptable and safe to use. The adsorbent may be regenerated and reused or treated as a waste.

This application is a non provisional of provisional application Ser. No. 60 824 174 filed Aug. 31 2006.

This invention was made with government support under Contract No. 05 JV 1111120 102 awarded by the United States Department of Agriculture. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Fuel oil spills resulting from storage tank leaks overfills or catastrophic floods may pose a sizable risk to human health. Hydrocarbons and other chemicals spilled during the flood hurricane get entrapped along with water inside the pore spaces of solids thus forming so called ganglia a three dimensional network of pores filled with a mixture of chemicals and water. This problem emerged after a catastrophic flood that occurred in Grand Forks N. Dak. in April 1997. During the flood a number of fuel oil tanks in residential basements were ruptured and the spilled hydrocarbons mixed with water and were absorbed into the concrete walls of the basements as well as into wooden flooring and first floor framing wood. Afterward slow evaporation exposed residents to hydrocarbon vapors which lasted for years. The residual vapor concentration in some residence basements was high enough that the EPA condemned the houses resulting in their total destruction.

Porous solid materials such as concrete wood gypsum brick and like materials can become contaminated with semivolatile organic chemicals which pose a sizeable risk to human health. Semivolatile organic chemicals such as fuel oil diesel and other transportation fuels come in contact with and can be absorbed into porous solid materials typically as a result of spills leakage and or catastrophic floods. Other sources of contaminating semivolatile organic chemicals include household chemicals solvents pesticides herbicides insecticides and other industrial chemicals that can be absorbed into porous materials due to commercial industrial or home use. Semivolatile organic chemicals can also be absorbed into porous materials due to intentional acts of sabotage where these organic chemicals are used as chemical warfare agents or delivered in conjunction with other chemical warfare agents.

Unfortunately common remediation techniques such as heating and pump and treat technologies prove to be inefficient for the removal of semi volatile organic chemicals from concrete and wood. For example heating causes pollutants to penetrate deeper within concrete blocks which inhibits remediation and merely delays the release of the organic vapors into the ambient air. Treating surfaces with soap also does not work in this application. Surfactants can not reach the organic chemicals trapped in the ganglia and thus are not effective in causing these chemicals to be removed from the material.

The problem is not limited to hydrocarbons and or floods. For instance military munitions production and storage facilities may be heavily contaminated with hazardous explosives and the by products of their manufacture such as trinitrotoluene TNT and 2 4 dinitrotoluene DNT . Common remediation techniques have been shown to be ineffective in these applications as well.

It is evident that there is a compelling need for an efficient method of removing organic chemicals from the pore spaces of monolith type solids. The present invention demonstrates how an externally applied adsorbent can be used to reduce the amount of semi volatile organic chemicals absorbed into porous solid materials upon application of the applied adsorbent to the surface of the building materials.

A method of removing pollutants from pores of solid monolith type materials has been discovered and developed. The method consists of contacting a significant amount of an adsorbent with a high affinity for at least one pollutant to a surface of the porous solid material to be treated. Contact is maintained until sufficient semi volatile organic chemicals are removed to make the building materials acceptable. In the event that a single application is insufficient for complete removal of the pollutant chemical s to safe levels a second application of a new batch or renewed batch of the adsorbent is applied. This process is then repeated until the pollutant chemical s has been removed to safe levels. An alternative of the process involves using either batch or sequential application of multiple quantities of adsorbent for the removal of multiple pollutant chemicals.

In the present invention a method is described wherein adsorbents are applied to porous solid materials that include microporous building materials such as wood and nanoporous building materials such as concrete. The present invention is designed to take advantage of this finding through the following aspects 

In the first aspect of the invention a method of reducing the amount of semivolatile organic chemicals contained in porous solid material is performed by applying an adsorbent on the surface of a solid material.

In the second aspect of the invention semivolatile organic chemicals are organic chemical compounds having a vapor pressure of less than 400 Pa at room temperature and more preferably vapor pressure of less than 200 Pa 100 Pa 50 Pa and 10 Pa. Chemical compounds include but are not limited to fuel oil diesel kerosene hydrocarbons such as hexadecane oxygenated compounds such as diethyl phthalate polychlorobiphenyls halogenated compounds such as DDT chlordane chlorinated dioxins and dibenzophanes and nitrocompounds such as DNT nitroglycerin nitrotoluene or trinitrotoluene .

In the third aspect of the invention porous solid materials include those materials used in building and construction. More preferably porous solid materials include concrete wood lumber gypsum brick masonry asphalt cement cinder tile drywall and like materials.

In the sixth aspect of the invention adsorbents are those biological substances that include but are not limited to charcoal activated carbon clays diatomaceous earth zeolites and silica.

In the seventh aspect of the invention the adsorbent is in contact with the porous solid material for at least 6 hours or longer. More preferably the adsorbent is in contact for at least 12 hours 24 hours 2 days 1 week or longer. In some cases the adsorbent is in contact for at least 2 weeks or longer.

In the eighth aspect of the invention upon application of an adsorbent material the concentration of semivolatile organic chemicals absorbed in the porous solid material are reduced by at least 10 and more preferably by at least 20 40 60 80 90 or greater.

In the eleventh aspect of the invention the adsorbent application is used as a post treatment following the application of chemical photochemical or biological methods.

In the twelfth aspect of the invention the adsorbent application contains a photocatalyst or biomass.

In order to accurately clarify the invention the following terms have the following associated meanings 

 Semivolatile organic chemicals means those organic chemical compounds containing at least one carbon to carbon bond and having a boiling point greater than 250 C. with a corresponding vapor pressure of less than 400 Pa at room temperature. They do not volatilize immediately upon contamination of the building material yet they volatilize slowly thus contaminating the indoor air over the course of many years.

 Porous solid material means those materials that have a structure such that semivolatile organic chemicals applied to the surface of that material may diffuse through the opening or pores in the structure into the interior of the material. The pores must be present in a unified quantity of the material as opposed to being the result of void spaces located between multiple unified quantities of the material whereby the pore sizes of the material are less than 1 micrometer. The pore size of mature concrete is between about 0.003 micrometers i.e. nanopores and 0.1 micrometers i.e. micropores H. F. Taylor Cement Chemistry 2nd Ed. T. Telford London 1998 . The pores of wood are larger but they periodically narrow down to only about 0.2 micrometers forming pointed end pores J. Siau Springer Verlag Berlin 1995 Tsuchikawa S. and H. W. Siesler Applied Spectroscopy 2003 57 667 674 T. A. Burnes R. A. Blanchette and R. L. Farrell Applied and Environmental Microbiology 2000 66 5201 5205 .

 Partitioning means a distribution of a chemical between different phases according to the corresponding thermodynamic equilibrium.

 Adsorption means partitioning onto the surface of an adsorbent whereas absorption is partitioning into the bulk D. Kealyer and P. J. Haines BIOS Scientific Publishers Oxford UK 2002 .

 Molecular scale diffusion often called simple diffusion or diffusion is random motion of molecules preferential in the direction of the concentration gradient Cussler E. L. pp. 28 35 101 141 . New York Cambridge University Press 1997 . Unlike flow diffusion which can be much faster molecular scale diffusion in liquids and solids is slow the typical values of diffusion coefficients are on the order of 10m s. It is even slower by several orders of magnitude within the network of pores of solid materials J. Siau Springer Verlag Berlin 1995 .

 Wet samples refer to samples that have been soaked in a beaker of a contaminant and submerged in distilled water for 3 hours.

 Aged samples mean samples that have been soaked in a beaker of a contaminant for a period of 10 days.

 Fresh samples mean samples that have been soaked in a beaker of a contaminant for a period of 1 day.

 Photocatalyst means those chemical substances which in the presence of an ultraviolet light source of appropriate wavelength and intensity will facilitate a chemical reaction between two or more chemical compounds. Whereby facilitate means that the overall reaction rate is at least twice as fast as the overall reaction rate in the absence of either the photocatalyst or the appropriate ultraviolet light source.

 Biomass means pre grown microbial cells either grown as suspended in a liquid aqueous medium or attached on a solid medium agar .

In the present invention a method is described wherein adsorbents are applied to porous solid materials that include microporous building materials such as wood and nanoporous building materials such as concrete and diffusion of the substantially non vaporized pollutant semivolatile organic chemicals from the interior of the solid material to the surface to enable partitioning of the pollutant in the adsorbent is allowed resulting in the reduction of pollutant concentration within the material treated. Contact is maintained until sufficient semivolatile organic chemicals are removed to make the building materials acceptable this usually requires a few days because sufficient time should be allowed for the contaminant s molecular scale diffusion from the pores of the building material toward the surface for partitioning with the adsorbent.

Although adsorbents have been commonly used to remove pollutants from liquids or gases the application of these materials to porous solid materials has not been previously used to reduce the level of chemical contaminants of these materials. The method appears to be effective for both aged building materials that have been exposed in excess of one week and fresh materials that have been recently exposed. It is well known to those skilled in the art that methods of extraction of adsorbed chemicals may be ineffective or virtually ineffective for aged samples. This effect is particularly pronounced for samples contaminated with poorly water soluble chemicals inundated with water.

The low temperature and or low moisture level in the treatment room may be significant for the success of the treatment. A dehumidifier type apparatus and or air conditioner could be operated. Generally the temperature range should be kept between 5 C. and 40 C.

The length of time needed for pollutant removal varies depending on the amount and characteristics of the pollutant the composition of the contaminated structure and which embodiment of the present invention is used. Generally the process will require about one week to two months.

Once the desired amount of pollutant is removed from the contaminated structure the adsorbent material and support if applicable is removed and the structure is cleaned with detergent and water.

Other remediation techniques use adsorptive materials such as charcoal for the removal of contaminants from porous surfaces particularly concrete and asphalt. However this proposed process only deals with the removal of contaminants from the surface of the concrete and does not address contaminant removal from deep within its pores U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006 0276361 .

Remediation techniques for the removal of contaminants from porous surfaces using photocatalysts U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006 0207870 and biomass U.S. Pat. No. 7 144 725 have been previously discussed.

Concrete samples were fragmented from a single standard 3000 psi concrete tile manufactured at Concrete Inc Grand Forks N. Dak. U.S.A. . Wood samples were commercial grade Southern Yellow Pine purchased from Menards Grand Forks N. Dak. U.S.A. and all chemicals used were reagent grade. C labeled n hexadecane and DNT were purchased from Sigma and American Radiolabeled Chemicals St. Louis Mo. respectively. All chemicals solutions and tools were steam sterilized by autoclaving for one hour at 2.5 atm and the experiments were conducted in the dark to eliminate the possibility of potential bio and photo remediation.

Scintillation counting was performed on a Beckman 6800 counter in plastic vials using 5 mL of Econo safe scintillation cocktail Research Products International Mount Prospect Ill. U.S.A. .

Each piece of concrete was contaminated by adding 30 L of C labeled n hexadecane to its surface wrapping in aluminum foil and storing under a fume hood at room temperature. Incubation period was 10 days for aged samples and 1 day for fresh samples. For creating wet samples following the contamination the samples were submerged in distilled water for 3 hours. The control sample in demonstrated that this process results in concrete contaminated with n hexadecane. Dry activated carbon was prepared by 2 hour pre heating in an oven at 110 C. unless otherwise noted.

Activated carbon was applied to wet or dry contaminated pieces of concrete for different times ranging from one seven fourteen or twenty one days. After this time concrete samples were crushed into powder using a hammer and were placed in 22 mL vials.

The C labeled n hexadecane present in concrete was extracted as follows 10 mL of ethyl acetate per 1.5 g piece of crushed concrete was incubated on a rotary shaker for more than 80 hours. This was followed by using a second extracting solvent n pentane. C labeled DNT present in wood or concrete was extracted by acetonitrile using a similar procedure. Complete extraction was verified by scintillation counting.

To analyze the amount of C labeled contaminant in the adsorbent the spent activated carbon was extracted with an appropriate solvent and an aliquot was taken for scintillation counting. The procedure of extraction from carbon was carried out using the Soxhlet extraction. Contaminated carbon was placed inside a cellulose thimble Whatman 25 90 which was loaded into the Soxhlet extractor. The extractor was attached to a condenser and 250 mL round bottom flask containing 100 mL of the extraction solvent pentane . The solvent was heated to achieve boiling and evaporation into the extraction chamber. The chamber filling rate was 10 cycles per hour. Extraction was carried out for 24 hours. Then the extracted solution was cooled at room temperature and concentrated by evaporation to a measured volume approximately 20 mL on a rotavapor. An extraction efficiency of 92 96 was achieved for all activated carbon samples.

Inundation of the contaminated concrete with water or aging contaminated samples for 10 days significantly reduces the efficiency of the hydrocarbon removal. To compensate for this drop in efficiency the activated carbon is pre heated prior to application.

One of the problems with the removal of pollutants from porous materials is that they are mixed with water in pores forming so called ganglia. As a result their diffusion toward the surface i.e. the treatment site is hindered. This is particularly pronounced for poorly water soluble pollutants such as hydrocarbons. Application of adsorbents as a pre treatment prior to the use of chemical photo chemical or biological treatment of the contaminated material contributes to solving this problem.

In our experiments application of diatomaceous earth or activated carbon to both wood and concrete completely saturated with water the details are given in the previous examples resulted in the removal of 20 30 of water in 1 day ca. 50 60 of water in 7 days and up to 70 in 14 21 days. When activated carbon was used on n hexadecane or DNT contaminated wood or concrete the concomitant partial pollutant removal was also observed as described in the previous examples.

One of the problems with the removal of pollutants from porous materials is that a sizable portion of the pollutant remains inaccessible for the surface treatment chemical photo chemical or biological because it is trapped within the pores and is inaccessible within the timeframe of the method used. The application of an adsorbent after such a treatment to remove the residual pollutants may significantly ameliorate this problem because the timeframe of this treatment is not limited.

Activated carbon is one substance that is capable of removing pollutants from porous solid materials. Other methods remove pollutants by contacting microbial biomass onto the surface of contaminated porous solid materials U.S. Pat. No. 7 144 725 . For example naphthalene removal from concrete and n hexadecane removal from concrete and wood served as model systems for studying the use of microbial biomass for removal of contamination in that invention.

In one embodiment of the present invention a mixture of activated carbon and bacteria may be used to provide a greater reduction and or faster removal rate of contaminants from porous solid materials than activated carbon by itself.

A second method described previously removed pollutants by contacting a photocatalyst onto the surface of a contaminated solid substance U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006 0207870 . This invention discussed a method of using a photocatalyst specifically titanium dioxide TiO to accelerate the reduction in the concentration of one or more semivolatile organic chemicals from porous solid materials using a photocatalyst and a light source.

In one embodiment of the present invention DNT and n hexadecane may be used as model systems to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of their removal from concrete and wood. TiOmay be mixed with activated carbon where activated carbon is about 40 to 99 of the total final weight. Next a desired amount of the activated carbon TiOmixture may be mixed with water in a 1 1 volume to volume ratio to form a paste. The paste may then be loaded onto contaminated samples of wood or concrete. To activate the photocatalyst the application is subjected to continuous exposure of light within the range of 150 nanometers to 350 nanometers. The activated carbon TiOpaste may remain in contact with contaminated wood and concrete until a sufficient amount of contaminant is removed which may be for a period of approximately 1 3 weeks or less.

In yet another embodiment the activated carbon bacteria or activated carbon photocatalyst may be stored separately to ensure the remedial effects of the activated carbon bacteria and or photocatalyst are not compromised.

While activated carbon has proven to be very effective in the removal of contaminants from the pores of porous solid materials it does not destroy the contaminant. A potentially dangerous contaminant adhering to the surface of the activated carbon gives rise to two issues 1 the activated carbon is no longer usable and 2 the activated carbon is now considered a waste product.

In one embodiment of the present invention a mixture of contaminated activated carbon and bacteria may be combined to remove the adsorbed contaminants from the surface of the activated carbon.

In another embodiment of the invention TiOmay be mixed with contaminated activated carbon where the contaminated activated carbon is about 40 to 99 of the total final weight. Next a desired amount of the activated carbon TiOmixture may be mixed with water in a 1 1 volume to volume ratio to form a paste. To activate the TiOphotocatalyst the paste is subjected to continuous exposure of light within the range of 150 nanometers to 350 nanometers. The TiOmay remain in contact with contaminated activated carbon until a sufficient amount of contaminant is removed which may be for a period of 1 3 weeks or less. This may ensure the activated carbon is clean and does not need to be treated as waste and also may render the activated carbon reusable.

Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
