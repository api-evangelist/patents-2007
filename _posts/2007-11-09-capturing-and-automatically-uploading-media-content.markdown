This document relates generally to capturing and automatically uploading media content and in particular to automatically uploading media content captured by a mobile device to an online service provider.

A mobile computing or communication device e.g. a smartphone cell phone personal digital assistant PDA etc. may include a camera that enables a user of the mobile computing or communication device to capture still or video images. Images that are captured by the mobile computing or communication device may be stored on the device displayed by the device or transferred to external equipment for display or other processing.

External equipment may include various online service providers for sharing media content e.g. image audio or video content such as image audio or video sharing service providers e.g. PICASA FLICKR PHOTOBUCKET MYSPACE.COM FACEBOOK YOUTUBE etc. . Users may open user accounts on such online service providers and subsequently use their accounts to store uploaded content and share that content with other designated users or with the general public. To organize uploaded content online service providers may allow users to create folders and add information to the folders or to content within folders e.g. keywords categories and other classification information for sorting or filtering content . To upload content to an online service provider the user may employ for example a desktop computer and a small application to locate content on the desktop computer and upload it the online service provider e.g. to the user s account maintained by the online service provider or to a folder within the user s account . As another example a user may manually email instances of media content to the online service provider.

This document describes methods and systems for capturing media content e.g. image audio or video content from a device e.g. a mobile device such as a smartphone cell phone personal digital assistant PDA etc. and automatically uploading it to an online service provider such as a media content sharing service. In some implementations the captured media content may be automatically uploaded to the online service provider without the device receiving contemporaneous user input that specifies that the captured media content is to be uploaded. That is a user may initially configure his or her device by specifying an online service provider to which captured media content should be automatically uploaded any necessary account information for the online service provider and preference information regarding how and when captured media content should be uploaded. Subsequently the user may capture media content using the device and the device may automatically upload the captured media content according to the configuration information without requiring further user action contemporaneous with the uploading.

In some implementations a computer implemented method for automatically uploading media content from a mobile device to an online service provider includes receiving in a mobile device identifying information corresponding to a user account associated with at least one of the plurality of online service providers. The mobile device can have a media input component configured to capture media content and a wireless communication component configured to wirelessly send data to and wirelessly receive data from a plurality of online service providers that are external to the mobile device. The computer implemented method can further include capturing media content with the media input component and after the media content is captured automatically uploading to the at least one online service provider the captured media content and the identifying information. The media content can be automatically uploaded without the mobile device receiving user input that a is contemporaneous with the automatic uploading or that b specifies that the captured media content is to be uploaded to the at least one online service provider.

In some implementations the mobile device is a smartphone and the media input device comprises at least one of a still image camera a video camera and a microphone. In some implementations the mobile device is a wirelessly equipped digital camera. In some implementations the mobile device is a Global Positioning System GPS equipped mobile device and the captured media content comprises a plurality of GPS mapped locations corresponding to a route over which the GPS equipped mobile device traveled. The plurality of online service providers can include online image and video sharing service providers. The plurality of online service providers can include online audio sharing service providers.

Identifying information can include a device identifier associated with the mobile device. Identifying information can include access control information associated with the user account.

Automatically uploading the captured media content can include automatically uploading with the captured media content corresponding configuration information that causes the captured media content to be made available to the general public by the at least one online service provider. Automatically uploading the captured media content can include automatically uploading with the captured media content corresponding configuration information that causes the captured media content to be made available only to one or more other user accounts associated with one or more of the plurality of online service providers. Automatically uploading the captured media content can include automatically uploading media content that has not been deleted within a predetermined time of being captured. Automatically uploading the captured media content can include automatically uploading portions of the captured media content with the wireless communication component when the wireless communication component has available bandwidth over a channel coupling the mobile device and the at least one online service provider.

The computer implemented method can further include causing a message to be sent to each of the one or more other user accounts when the captured media content has been automatically uploaded to the at least one online service provider. Causing a message to be sent can include automatically sending an electronic message from the mobile device to the one or more other user accounts. Causing a message to be sent can include providing a control signal to the at least one online service provider that causes the at least one online service provider to send an electronic message to the one or more other user accounts.

The computer implemented method can further include automatically uploading to a second one of the plurality of online service providers the captured media content. The second online service provider can be different than the at least one online service provider. Automatically uploading to the second online service provider can include automatically uploading without receiving user input that a is contemporaneous to the automatic uploading to the second online service provider and b that specifies that the captured media content is to be uploaded to the second online service provider.

Capturing media content can include storing geographical location information associated with the mobile device at a point in time when the media content is captured. Automatically uploading the captured media content can include uploading with the captured media content the stored geographical location information.

The computer implemented method can further include providing status information in the mobile device that indicates a current status of the automatic uploading of the captured media content to the at least one online service provider.

In some implementations a device for capturing and automatically uploading media content to an online service provider includes a communication component configured to send data to and receive data from a plurality of online service providers that are external to the device a media content capturing component memory configured to store a identifying information corresponding to a user account associated with at least one of the plurality of online service providers and b captured media content that is acquired by the media content capturing component and an automatic upload management component configured to automatically upload to the at least one online service provider the captured media content and the identifying information without receiving contemporaneous user input specifying that the captured media content is to be uploaded to the at least one online service provider. The device can further include a component that provides a function associated with a household appliance the function selected from the group comprising heating or cooling food or beverage items washing household items or drying household items.

In some implementations a device for capturing and automatically uploading media content to an online service provider includes a communication component configured to send data to and receive data from a plurality of online service providers that are external to the device a media content capturing component memory configured to store a identifying information corresponding to a user account associated with at least one of the plurality of online service providers and b captured media content that is acquired by the media content capturing device and a means for automatically uploading to the at least one online service provider the captured media content and the identifying information without receiving contemporaneous user input specifying that the captured media content is to be uploaded to the at least one online service provider.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

This document describes methods and systems for capturing media content e.g. image audio or video content from a device e.g. a mobile device such as a smartphone cell phone personal digital assistant PDA etc. and automatically uploading it to an online service provider such as a media content sharing service. In some implementations the captured media content may be automatically uploaded to the online service provider without the device receiving contemporaneous user input that specifies that the captured media content is to be uploaded. That is a user may initially configure his or her device by specifying an online service provider to which captured media content should be automatically uploaded any necessary account information for the online service provider and preference information regarding how and when captured media content should be uploaded. Subsequently the user may capture media content using the device and the device may automatically upload the captured media content according to the configuration information without requiring further user action contemporaneous with the uploading.

In one implementation as shown the mobile device can connect to a network . The network is shown as a single network but the reader will appreciate that various networks can be included in the network such as for example a wireless communication network the Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN the internet and various other networks e.g. private networks that are connected to one of the above mentioned networks .

Through the network a user of the mobile device can communicate with users A and of other respective mobile devices A and B. In particular for example users and A may communicate through a voice connection e.g. a telephone call facilitated by the network or a portion thereof. As another example users A and may communicate through text messages such as electronic mail messages or short message service SMS messages that are routed through the network or a portion thereof.

In addition to facilitating communication between users the network enables the mobile device to access content from content and service providers that are accessible from the network . For example a content provider may provide news and other information to users who connect to the network using mobile devices e.g. mobile devices A or B or other computing devices such as a computing device . The content provider can represent any online content or service provider such as for example CNN MSNBC ESPN or GOOGLE. As another example a service provider may facilitate online communication between many different users or sharing of media content between users. The service provider can represent any online content or service provider such as for example PICASA FLICKR PHOTOBUCKET MYSPACE.COM or FACEBOOK to name a few specific examples.

In some implementations a user of the computing device or the mobile device can manually upload media content to the online service provider in particular to storage space associated with an account corresponding to the user . For example a user of the computing device may store digital pictures on the computing device . At some point the user may desire to upload a portion of the digital pictures to the online service provider i.e. to storage space associated with the user for example to organize the portion of pictures into albums and share the albums with other specific users who have corresponding accounts on the content provider or to share the portion of pictures with the general public. In order the upload the portion of pictures the user may employ an upload tool provided by the online service provider e.g. an upload application that allows the user to view various digital pictures that are stored on the computing device and individually select pictures for uploading to the service provider .

As another example a user of the mobile device may take a picture or video using a camera included in the mobile device then subsequently transmit the picture or video to the online service provider i.e. to an account associated with the user which is depicted by storage space and hereafter referred to as account . In particular for example the user may email the picture to a specialized inbox maintained by the online service provider for receiving media content.

In some implementations the process of uploading media content to the online service provider is automated. For example the user may initially configure the mobile device to identify the online service provider as well as to store and provide when uploading media content corresponding account information e.g. a username and password for the account that is maintained by the online service provider that corresponds to the user . The user may also configure the mobile device with various preferences for uploading media content to the online service provider e.g. preferences related to types of media content to automatically upload whether uploaded content is to be made available to the general public to specific other users or to be maintained as private whether to send a notification message to any other users once content is uploaded etc. . Once configured the mobile device may automatically upload content that is subsequently captured by the mobile device .

An example process by which media content can be automatically uploaded to the online service provider is now described in more detail. In this example the user of the mobile device has previously configured the mobile device to automatically upload digital photos to the account which is maintained by the online service provider e.g. PICASA . In the example process the user employs the mobile device to capture a digital image of a scene using a camera that is included in the mobile device . Once a digital image of the scene is captured the digital image can be automatically uploaded to the online service provider . In particular the digital image can be transmitted to the online service provider via the network e.g. a wireless communication network and the internet and in particular to the user s account e.g. via paths A B C and D .

Identifying information corresponding to the user can also transmitted to the online service provider along with the digital image . In some implementations the identifying information is an account name or number and corresponding login information e.g. access control information such as an account number or username and corresponding password . In other implementations the identifying information is a device identifier associated with the mobile device . For example during an initial configuration process the device identifier associated with the mobile device e.g. a device serial number or other device specific identifying information may be associated with the account of the user such that the account can be subsequently accessed using the device identifier. The reader will appreciate that various other kinds of identifying information can be employed and that in general any way of securely and uniquely identifying an account can be employed.

The above example may be understood in the context of a packet switched transmission in which the digital image is transmitted to the online service provider in one or more packets of information that are individually routed over the network to the online service provider . For example packets carrying portions of the digital image may be transmitted to the online service provider whenever bandwidth is available e.g. when other wireless functionality of the mobile device is not in use . In some implementations packets can be transmitted in the background while other application s on the mobile device are in use.

The above example may also be understood in the context of a circuit switched connection between the mobile device and the online service provider . For example the mobile device may open a connection e.g. a circuit to the online service provider when the mobile device detects that a camera component or other media capturing component has been activated. As part of opening the connection the mobile device may transmit account identifying information that specifies a destination for subsequently captured media content e.g. account . As media content is captured the mobile device may then transmit it over the open connection to the online service provider .

In some implementations the user may have already captured some media content with the mobile device and stored that media content in the mobile device before configuring the mobile device to automatically upload media content. In such implementations previously stored media content may also be automatically uploaded. For example after receiving configuration information to automatically upload captured media content the mobile device may search its memory identify media content that is currently stored therein and that has not already been uploaded and upload the stored media content in the manner described above. Further details of such scenarios are provided with reference to .

Some level of filtering may be applied before media content is automatically uploaded. For example in some implementations there is a delay between the media content being captured and the captured media content being automatically uploaded. Such implementations can account for media content being captured in the mobile device and then being discarded. In particular for example if the user of the mobile device captures ten digital images within a short period of time then deletes six of the captured images shortly after capturing them only the four digital images that are not deleted may be uploaded. In some implementations filtering may include identifying certain types of media content to automatically upload. For example the mobile device may be configured to automatically upload digital images and digital video captured by the mobile device but not digital audio that is captured by the mobile device.

In some implementations contents of the mobile device and contents of the corresponding user s account are synchronized. For instance with reference to the above example in which ten digital images are captured if the six digital images are deleted after the ten digital images are captured and uploaded e.g. a day or two later a week later etc. the mobile device may automatically send a command to the online service provider to cause the six images that were deleted on the mobile device to also be deleted from the account .

In addition to transmitting to the online service provider media content itself and any identifying information necessary to store the media content in storage associated with a particular user account e.g. account the mobile device can also transmit to the online service provider information that specifies how the transmitted media content is to be treated in particular whether the transmitted media content is to be treated as private content that is available to only the user who captured the content whether the transmitted media content is to be treated as public e.g. and made available to the general public by the online service provider whether the transmitted media content is to be treated as semi public e.g. and made available to certain other users such as certain identified users also having accounts with the online service provider .

In some implementations certain other users are notified when media content is uploaded that meets one or more criteria. One criterion may be that the media that is not identified as private. Another criterion may be that the media is video media having a length within some threshold range e.g. between 15 and 200 seconds or a size within some threshold range e.g. video media that is between 500 kilobytes and 2 megabytes . Another criterion may be that the media is image content having certain metadata e.g. a captured date within one week of being uploaded media that is tagged with particular geo location information e.g. GPS coordinates other geo coordinates or more general geographical information such as Mt. Rainier . Any other criteria may be employed to assist a user in filtering uploaded media content about which others are notified. Similarly any criteria may be employed by other users who subscribe to media content to filter notifications to include only notifications about uploaded content for which the others users may have an interest in obtaining.

To further illustrate some online services facilitate the creation of social networks e.g. a network of users where a first user such as the user and a second user may be linked by being identified as friends in such scenarios users within a social network e.g. friends who are linked to each other within some degree e.g. direct mutually linked friends first degree friends of friends second degree connection friends of friends of friends third degree connection etc. may be notified each time a user s media content is uploaded or each a time a user s media that meets appropriate criteria is uploaded . In particular for example the online service provider may be configured to send an SMS or email message to other users in the social network whenever media content is uploaded for the user .

As another notification example some online services facilitate subscriptions whereby users can sign up to receive subscribe to notifications of new content available from other users or to receive the content itself e.g. via email or in a special message box provided the online service provider . In such scenarios users who have subscribed to content available from the user can receive an SMS or email message whenever media content from the user is uploaded.

In the above examples in which other users are notified when a user s media content is uploaded from the mobile device messages to the other users may in some implementations come from the online service provider . For purposes of this example the other users can include the users A and . In particular for example the online service provider may send SMS messages or other types of messages to the users A and via paths E F and Gand G based on configuration information associated with the user account e.g. configuration information identifying users A and as friends of the user or other users who have subscribed to content of the user . Alternatively if the users A and also have accounts with the online service provider messages may be placed in a message area e.g. an inbox associated with those users accounts. The messages may include a link to the new content to enable the users A and to efficiently access that new content.

In other implementations the users A and may be directly notified of new media content by the mobile device rather than by the online service provider . That is as or after new media content is automatically uploaded from the mobile device to the online service provider the mobile device may automatically send SMS messages or other types of messages to the users A and alerting them that new content is available from the user .

In order to ensure that the content is actually available from the online service provider there may be some delay between the time the content is uploaded from the mobile device and the time the messages are sent to the users A and . In particular for example the mobile device may be configured to wait a predetermined period of time e.g. 30 seconds one minute ten minutes four hours etc. after uploading new media content before notifying the users A and alternatively the mobile device may receive a confirmation message from the online service provider once the media content has been successfully received and the mobile device may wait until receiving the confirmation message before notifying the users A and of the new content. In some implementations a confirmation message includes a direct link to the newly uploaded content and the mobile device may provide the direct link in notification messages to the users A and to enable the users to quickly navigate to the new content.

As depicted in one implementation in the mobile device includes a display screen and possibly other output devices which are not shown input devices e.g. buttons a hard keyboard a soft keyboard such as an image of a keyboard on a touch sensitive screen etc. and applications e.g. programming code stored in memory that can be executed by a processor to receive input from the input devices process the input and present corresponding output in the display screen or through other output devices .

A display module can include programming code and hardware necessary to receive information from the applications and from other sources transform the information into a format that is suitable for controlling the display screen e.g. a pixel format that specifies data for each pixel in the display screen including for example a row and column address a color for the pixel and an intensity for the pixel and provide the transformed information to the display screen or more particularly a hardware interface that controls the display screen in some implementations .

Other types of input devices can also be included such as media capturing devices that can include a camera component a microphone component and a location pinpointing component . The camera component can be a still image or video image capturing device for capturing image data. The microphone component can be a microphone element for capturing audio data.

The location pinpointing component can be a component configured to identify a current location of the mobile device . For example in some implementations the location pinpointing component is a Global Positioning System GPS component that can capture current latitude and longitude information and optionally altitude information of the mobile device e.g. using signals from multiple GPS satellites . As another example the location pinpointing component can be a component that captures location information in another manner such as a component that receives triangulation based information from a corresponding wireless network or a component that directly determines a location relative to nearby wireless towers based on signals that are transmitted from those towers e.g. using triangulation or other suitable techniques . The location pinpointing component can employ other methods of determining a current location of the mobile device some of which are described in more detail below with reference to .

Some applications can provide messaging functionality e.g. SMS or email applications . In order for such applications to exchange messages with external devices through an external network the mobile device can include a wireless communication component . Wireless communication functionality is described in greater detail below for example with reference to .

As depicted in one implementation the mobile device includes data storage component e.g. memory that can provide storage for various application data. In particular in the context of capturing and uploading media content the mobile device can include storage for storing account information associated with a user account maintained by an online service provider e.g. the user account maintained by the online service provider for the user shown in . In addition media content can be saved in the storage after being captured e.g. an audio file depicted for example by element a video file depicted for example by element and still image file depicted for example by element .

As described in greater detail with reference to a user of the mobile device can capture media content using the camera component or the microphone component captured media content can be stored in the data storage component e.g. as a video file an image file or an audio file and an application e.g. one of the applications can automatically upload the stored media content and account information to an online service provider using the wireless communication component .

Two example media capturing components and are shown in but the reader will appreciate that the mobile device can include various other media capturing components for capturing other kinds of media. For example a GPS receiver or another type of receiver capable of capturing geographical information corresponding to a current location of the mobile device can capture route information e.g. a route including a series of geographical locations over which the mobile device traverses . In some implementations partial route information is periodically uploaded as the route is traversed in other implementations data for an entire route can be automatically uploaded when a user indicates that the route is complete e.g. by providing input to a route capturing application . As other examples other media capturing components can capture other kinds of media such as for example audio content video content acceleration or vibration content temperature content humidity content barometric pressure content or other weather condition related content content that includes non visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum e.g. x rays infrared ultra high frequency content etc. and other kinds of content that can be captured by an input device included in the mobile device and stored electronically. Moreover multimedia content can also be captured and automatically uploaded.

The method can also include capturing media content. For example with reference to the user can employ the mobile device to capture a digital image of the scene . In particular the user can employ a camera component e.g. camera component shown in and a corresponding image capturing application included in the applications to capture the digital image. Upon capturing the digital image the mobile device may store the digital image in memory included in the mobile device e.g. the digital image may be stored as the file in a data storage area of memory depicted as element .

The method includes automatically uploading to the online service provider the captured media content without receiving contemporaneous user input to upload the captured media content. In this context contemporaneous input can include input that is received shortly before e.g. a second before several seconds before one or more minutes before the media content is uploaded. In contrast automatically uploading media content without receiving contemporaneous user input to upload the captured media content can include for example automatically uploading media content based on configuration information that was received five minutes before the media content is automatically uploaded 30 minutes before the media content is automatically uploaded two days before the media content is uploaded six months before the media content is automatically uploaded etc. That is the media content can be uploaded in response to configuration information that was previously received by the mobile device but specific instances of media can be automatically uploaded based on general configuration settings rather than in response to direct contemporaneous user input that is particular to the specific instances of media.

To further illustrate with continued reference to after the user has captured the digital image of the scene e.g. the electronic file depicted as element one of the applications can cause captured media content e.g. the file and account identifying information e.g. account information to be transmitted by the wireless communication component . In particular the wireless communication component can cause the captured media content and the account identifying information to be transmitted to the online service provider e.g. via the network along paths A B C and D .

In some implementations other information associated with the captured content can also be transmitted to the online service provider . For example as described above configuration preferences regarding how the captured media is to be treated e.g. as publicly available media as private media as semi private media etc. can also be transmitted with the captured media. As another example some implementations may also include geographical information associated with the captured media. In particular the location pinpointing component shown in can capture location information of the mobile device any time media content is captured. Such location information can be stored with the captured media content and transmitted to the online service provider with the content itself e.g. to enable the media content to be geotagged or geocoded . Other metadata or information can also be provided with the media content e.g. a size of the media content a resolution a file format a timestamp corresponding to when the media content was captured etc. .

In some implementations as described above messages e.g. SMS or email messages may be sent to various other users alerting the other users that new media content from the user has been uploaded. The messages could be sent from the mobile device or from the online service provider . In addition a confirmation message may be sent from the online service provider to the mobile device to alert the user that media content has been successfully uploaded.

As shown in one implementation the graphical summary can include a thumbnail for each digital image that is being automatically uploaded e.g. thumbnails A B C D and E . The graphical summary can include a progress bar that may be filled in as media content is uploaded. A checkbox can also be displayed next to each thumbnail and the checkbox can be either checked e.g. as checkbox A is or unchecked as checkbox E is for example depending on whether the corresponding media e.g. digital image has been fully uploaded to the appropriate online service provider.

The graphical summary can provide status to the user which may be useful when the media content is large in which case some time and network bandwidth may be required to upload the media content . In addition when multiple different media files are uploaded the graphical summary can provide the user with status information regarding specific media files. For example as depicted in the graphical summary may indicate to a user that media file A has been fully uploaded media file D is currently being uploaded and medial file E has not yet been uploaded.

The information in the graphical summary may serve as confirmation to a user that his or her content has been uploaded or the information may enable the user to take other actions. For example a user may wish to directly notify certain friends by email once specific media content has been uploaded and the graphical summary may provide confirmation information to which the user can refer in order to know when to send the email. This feature may be particularly advantageous for example when the user desires to notify other people that specific content has been uploaded when the other people are not configured to be automatically notified e.g. by the mobile device or by the online service provider with an SMS message .

The graphical summary may be useful in other situations as well. For example if the user has captured media content before configuring his or her mobile device to automatically upload media content to an online service provider when it is captured an automatic upload application may give the user an option to manually select already captured media content to initially upload to the online service provider from an interface such as the graphical summary . In such implementations the user may employ the illustrated checkboxes e.g. checkboxes A and E to indicate which already captured media content should be initially uploaded.

The graphical summary is merely exemplary and the reader will appreciate that various other graphical or textual status information may be provided for various purposes such as controlling the upload process or providing status regarding the same. For example a column could be added to screens that provide information about files stored in the mobile device e.g. file browser screens and each row corresponding to a file that has been uploaded to the online service provider could include an icon or special text e.g. a check mark or some other indicator . Other formats and status information is contemplated.

For semi private or private content the configuration tool can also enable the user to configure whether a message should be sent to certain other users e.g. designated friends of the user who have access to semi private content users who have subscribed to public content etc. by providing a checkbox A and can further enable the user to identify the certain other users e.g. with data entry fields A and B in which the other users content information such as email addresses can be included . Another checkbox B may be provided to configure whether a confirmation message should be sent back to the user once media content has been successfully received by the online service provider.

The configuration tool shown in is merely exemplary. For purposes of example various checkboxes radio buttons and data entry fields are shown but any suitable means for gathering relevant user input can be employed. In addition other information can be gathered which the mobile device can use in determining whether and how to automatically upload media content and whether to notify certain users once the media content has been uploaded. For example in some implementations a user specified time period may be entered specifying how long the mobile device should wait before automatically uploading media content. If media content is captured and deleted within the user specified time period of being captured the media content may not be uploaded. Such a feature may be advantageous for example to users who frequently take multiple digital pictures then delete several of the pictures and save only those that turn out best. In such scenarios the user may not want the subsequently deleted pictures to be uploaded and a user specified delay period may ensure that the undesired pictures are not uploaded. Various other kinds of configuration information are contemplated. As another example the configuration tool can be configured to query the user about whether to upload any available geographical information associated with the media content e.g. with an Include geo information checkbox .

Information gathered in a configuration tool such as the one shown in can be used to provide default handling settings for media content. In some implementations the default handling settings can be overridden on a media or media instance specific basis. For example the mobile device may display a text box not shown in the figures requesting user confirmation of whether to apply or override default handling information on a media specific basis e.g. anytime video content is captured . As another example a screen such as the summary screen shown in may enable a user to specifically confirm that certain media content instances should be uploaded according to the default handling information.

Referring now to the exterior appearance of an exemplary device that facilitates automatic uploading of media content is illustrated. Briefly and among other things the device includes a processor configured to provide interactive indicators which can reveal progressively more information about an alert message in response to user interaction with the corresponding interactive indicator.

In more detail the hardware environment of the device includes a display for displaying text images and video to a user a keyboard for entering text data and user commands into the device a pointing device for pointing selecting and adjusting objects displayed on the display an antenna a network connection a camera which can be employed to capture digital image or video media that can be automatically uploaded to an online service provider a microphone which can be employed to capture audio media that can be automatically uploaded to an online service provider and a speaker . Although the device shows an external antenna the device can include an internal antenna which is not visible to the user.

The display can display video graphics images and text that make up the user interface for the software applications used by the device and the operating system programs used to operate the device . Possible elements that may be displayed on the display include for example a new mail indicator that alerts a user to the presence of a new message an active call indicator that indicates that a telephone call is being received placed or is occurring a data standard indicator that indicates the data standard currently being used by the device to transmit and receive data a signal strength indicator that indicates a measurement of the strength of a signal received by via the antenna such as by using signal strength bars a battery life indicator that indicates a measurement of the remaining battery life or a clock that outputs the current time.
