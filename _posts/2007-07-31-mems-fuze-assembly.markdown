title: MEMS fuze assembly
abstract: A MEMS fuze having a moveable slider with a microdetonator at an end for positioning adjacent an initiator. A setback activated lock and a spin activated lock prevent movement of the slider until respective axial and centrifugal acceleration levels have been achieved. Once these acceleration levels are achieved, the slider is moved by a V-beam shaped actuator arrangement to position the microdetonator relative to a secondary lead to start an explosive train in a munitions round.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates in general relates to MEMS microelectromechanical systems devices and more particularly to a MEMS fuze utilized to set off a main charge of a munitions round.

A fuze is a device designed to set off an explosive train in a munitions round such as a mortar round artillery shell or rocket warhead by way of example. Conventional mechanical fuzes make use of a detonator such as an M100 which is cylindrical and approximately 3 mm millimeters in diameter and 10 mm in length. These detonators are mounted in a rotor mechanism with mechanical locks with a typical volume of greater than 10 cc cubic centimeters .

Such detonators are much too large for use in MEMS type fuzes and in addition they require assembly of multiple mechanical components resulting in higher complexity higher costs and lower reliability.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a fuze assembly that is over 100 times smaller than conventional detonators thus leaving more space for electronics and explosive material.

A MEMS fuze for use in a munitions round in accordance with the present invention includes a moveable slider with a microdetonator carried by the slider for positioning relative to a secondary lead to ignite the secondary lead when in position. A plurality of locks are provided each having a respective locking arm in interlocking engagement with the slider to prevent movement of the slider. The locks are released upon attainment of certain predetermined conditions to move the locking arms out of engagement with the slider whereby when the locking arms are disengaged from the slider the slider is operable to move the microdetonator into position for igniting the secondary lead.

When the slider moves to the right as indicated in by arrow microdetonator may be adjacent an initiator and directly above secondary lead whereupon the microdetonator may be initiated or detonated by the initiator . Secondary lead may be initiated by the microdetonator and set off a main explosive charge which is the main charge of the munitions round in which the apparatus is imbedded. Movement of slider may be inertial such as upon impact with a target or may be mechanical as will be described herein.

An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in . The MEMS fuze in includes slider which in an exemplary embodiment is driven mechanically as opposed to inertially. As a safety precaution and in accordance with safety regulations movement of the slider is initially prevented by a series of locks which are released upon attainment of certain predetermined conditions. Slider is in the safe position in and in the armed position in . By way of example the arrangement includes a setback activated lock and a spin activated lock .

Setback activated lock includes a setback inertial mass having a latching arm that engages with complementary first and second holding arms and these latter first and second holding arms may be connected to respective anchors and . Setback inertial mass is restrained from movement by spring connected to anchor . Setback activated lock additionally includes a locking arm which is in interlocking relationship with slider . More particularly the end of locking arm abuts a projection on slider to prevent movement thereof.

Setback inertial mass prevents movement of locking arm until setback inertial mass is moved out of the way. This movement occurs during launch of the munitions round when the axial acceleration force allows setback inertial mass to overcome action of spring such that latching arm may become latched with holding arms and . With setback inertial mass out of the way locking arm is free to disengage from projection of slider .

The disengagement is accomplished with the provision of a thermoelectric actuator such as V beam actuator . V beam actuator includes first and second sets of actuator beams and . One end of set is connected to anchor while the other end is connected to locking arm . One end of set is connected to a second anchor with the other end connected to locking arm . The first and second set of beams and are of a conductive elastic material with a high melting point such as silicon. When a current is applied to anchor the beams expand causing the locking arm to move in the direction of arrow . This current may be applied prior to unlocking of spin activated lock or subsequent thereto.

Spin activated lock includes a spin inertial mass having a latching arm which engages with complementary third and fourth holding arms and these latter third and fourth holding arms may be connected to respective anchors and . Spin inertial mass is restrained from movement by spring connected to anchor . Spin activated lock additionally includes a locking arm connected to spin inertial mass with the locking arm in interlocking relationship with slider . More particularly the end of locking arm abuts a projection on slider to prevent movement thereof. A sufficiently high centrifugal acceleration allows spin inertial mass to overcome action of spring such that latching arm becomes latched drawing locking arm out of engagement with projection to allow slider to move.

A thermoelectric actuator in the form of V beam actuator similar to V beam actuator is used to move the slider against action of springs and connected to respective anchors and . Slider includes an enlarged end portion in which is located the microdetonator .

To operate as a MEMS fuze the various springs locking arms and beam sets of the V beam actuators must be free to move and therefore must be free of any underlying silicon dioxide insulating layer . One way to accomplish the removal of the underlying insulating layer is by applying an etchant such as hydrofluoric acid which will dissolve the silicon dioxide. The etchant may in a relatively short period of time dissolve the insulation beneath the locking arms and the beam sets of the V beam actuators as well as the springs and slider because these components have small widths. The setback inertial mass and spin inertial mass must be free to move and therefore must be free of any underlying silicon dioxide insulating layer .

To shorten the time for dissolving the silicon dioxide under these relatively larger components masses each is provided with a series of apertures which extend from the top surface down to the insulating layer thereby allowing the etchant direct access to the silicon substrate . Although some of the etchant may dissolve the insulation under the anchors the process of freeing the other components is generally completed before the anchors are completely freed so that they that is the anchors remain immovable.

An actuator arm of V beam actuator carries one or more teeth at its end which are engageble with teeth on the bottom of slider . When V beam actuator is provided with current actuator arm moves to the left and teeth on actuator arm slide over teeth on slider . When current is removed V beam actuator reverts to its original position such that actuator arm will move back to the right. In so doing teeth engage with teeth to move the slider to the right.

A keeper arrangement prevents the slider from moving back under spring action once the slider has been advanced. Such a keeper arrangement includes a keeper arm secured to anchor . Keeper arm includes a set of teeth which are engageable with teeth on the top of slider . After slider is advanced teeth engage teeth to prevent backward movement of slider .

The process of providing current to and removing current from V beam actuator is repeated until slider has moved a sufficient distance such that microdetonator is adjacent initiator as illustrated in . When in position and at the proper time current may be supplied to initiator to initiate microdetonator and start the explosive train.

Current is supplied to initiator as well as to V beam actuators and by means of current sources not illustrated via electrical connections depicted by double ended arrow . A microprocessor not illustrated is operable to receive signals via electrical connections when latching arms and latch and when microdetonator is in position to command the current sources to provide the respective currents used in the operation.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
