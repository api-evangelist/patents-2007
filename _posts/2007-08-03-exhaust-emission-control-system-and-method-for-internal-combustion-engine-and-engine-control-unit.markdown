The present invention relates to an exhaust emission control system and method for an internal combustion engine and an engine control unit for reducing exhaust emissions by collecting particulates from exhaust gases discharged from an internal combustion engine particularly from a diesel engine installed on a means of transportation as a drive source.

In general in a diesel engine hereinafter referred to as the engine which uses an exhaust emission control system of the above mentioned type as the amount of particulate matter deposited on a filter increases exhaust pressure rises which results in a lowered engine output and decreased fuel economy. To avoid the above inconveniences a regeneration operation for regenerating the filter is carried out. This regeneration operation is performed by carrying out post injection for injecting fuel into a combustion chamber after a combustion stroke in addition to fuel required for combustion of the engine. The post injection causes exhaust gases to contain unburned fuel and the unburned fuel is burned upstream of the filter in an exhaust pipe to raise the temperature of the filter. As a consequence the particulate matter deposited on the filter is burned whereby the filter is regenerated.

During the filter regeneration operation part of the post injected fuel is deposited on the wall surface and the like part of the combustion chamber and mixed into engine lubricating oil without being discharged from the combustion chamber which causes oil dilution. If the oil dilution becomes excessive the engine lubricating oil cannot fully exert the effects of its lubricating function so that it is impossible to maintain a normal operation of the engine. To solve this problem a control system for an internal combustion engine for suppressing oil dilution has been proposed e.g. in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Kokai No. 2003 322044.

This control system is for a gasoline engine. In the control system at the start of the engine fuel injection timing is set according to the count value of a dilution counter. The count value is calculated as follows First a coolant temperature at the start of the engine is stored and during operation of the engine the integral value of the amount of intake air is calculated. Then if the coolant temperature and the integral value of the amount of intake air are not larger than respective predetermined values when the engine stops the counter value is incremented. This process is executed whenever the engine is operated. Then when the counter value exceeds a predetermined value it is judged that excessive oil dilution may have occurred and at the start of the engine the fuel injection timing is set to a further advanced value so as to suppress the oil dilution.

However in a case where the conventional control system is applied to a diesel engine having the aforementioned filter if post injection timing is set to an advanced value so as to suppress oil dilution the supplied fuel becomes easy to burn in the combustion chamber and hence unburned fuel required for filter regeneration cannot be supplied to the exhaust system of the engine which makes it difficult to fully regenerate the filter. Further the output torque increases for the same reason. On the other hand if the post injection is set to such timing as will enable filter regeneration part of fuel remains in the combustion chamber which prevents reliable suppression of oil dilution.

It is an object of the invention to provide an exhaust emission control system and method for an internal combustion engine and an engine control unit which are capable of not only reliably suppressing post injection for regenerating a filter from causing oil dilution but also enabling execution of the post injection to a maximum extent.

To attain the above object in a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an exhaust emission control system for an internal combustion engine for reducing exhaust emissions by collecting particulates from exhaust gases discharged from the engine which is installed on a means of transportation as a drive source into an exhaust system comprising a filter provided in the exhaust system for collecting the particulates from the exhaust gases regeneration operation executing means for carrying out post injection for additionally injecting fuel into a combustion chamber of the engine after a combustion stroke of the engine to thereby perform a regeneration operation for regenerating the filter travel distance detecting means for detecting a travel distance of the means of transportation post injection allowable amount calculating means for calculating a post injection allowable amount indicative of an allowable amount of fuel to be injected by the post injection such that the post injection allowable amount increases in accordance with an increase in the detected travel distance post injection allowable amount reducing means for subtracting an amount of fuel injected by the post injection from the post injection allowable amount during execution of the post injection and post injection inhibiting means for inhibiting the post injection when the post injection allowable amount is not larger than a predetermined first threshold value.

With the configuration of the exhaust emission control system according to the present invention particulates contained in exhaust gases discharged from the engine installed on the means of transportation are collected by the filter provided in the exhaust system. The regeneration operation executing means carries out the post injection after the combustion stroke of the engine to thereby perform the filter regeneration operation. As a consequence unburned fuel supplied to the exhaust system is burned on the filter or upstream of the filter to raise the temperature of the filter whereby particulate matter deposited on the filter is burned to regenerate the filter. The post injection allowable amount calculating means calculates the post injection allowable amount such that the post injection allowable amount increases in accordance with an increase in the detected travel distance of the means of transportation and the post injection allowable amount reducing means subtracts the amount of fuel injected by the post injection from the post injection allowable amount during execution of the post injection. Further the post injection inhibiting means inhibits the post injection when the post injection allowable amount is not larger than the predetermined first threshold value.

When the post injection is executed part of fuel is mixed into lubricating oil to increase the level of oil dilution. On the other hand when the engine is operated fuel mixed into the lubricating oil by the post injection progressively evaporates. As the travel distance of the means of transportation is longer the amount of evaporated fuel becomes larger and accordingly the oil dilution level becomes lower. According to the first aspect of the present invention the post injection allowable amount is calculated such that it increases in accordance with an increase in the travel distance. Consequently the calculated post injection allowable amount indicates that as the value thereof is larger the oil dilution level is lower. In short the post injection allowable amount represents an allowable amount of fuel to be injected by the post injection without causing excessive dilution.

Therefore using the post injection allowable amount as a parameter by inhibiting the post injection when a value obtained by subtracting the amount of post injected fuel from the post injection allowable amount becomes equal to or smaller than the first threshold value it is possible to reliably suppress oil dilution so as to prevent occurrence of excessive oil dilution. Further since the post injection is permitted insofar as the post injection allowable amount is larger than the first threshold value it is possible to execute the post injection to the maximum possible extent.

Preferably the exhaust emission control system further comprises post injection inhibition canceling means for canceling the inhibition of the post injection when the post injection allowable amount becomes not smaller than a predetermined second threshold value larger than the first threshold value during the inhibition of the post injection.

With the configuration of this preferred embodiment when the engine is operated in a state where the post injection is inhibited the evaporation of fuel proceeds in accordance with an increase in the travel distance of the means of transportation whereby oil dilution is reduced and the post injection allowable amount is calculated such that it increases in accordance with the increase in the travel distance. Therefore by canceling inhibition of the post injection when the post injection allowable amount becomes equal to or larger than the second threshold value after inhibiting the post injection it is possible to restart the post injection in appropriate timing in which oil dilution is positively reduced.

Preferably the exhaust emission control system further comprises regeneration completion determining means for determining whether or not regeneration of the filter by the regeneration operation has been completed and post injection allowable amount resetting means for resetting the post injection allowable amount when it is determined that the regeneration of the filter by the regeneration operation has been completed.

With the configuration of this preferred embodiment by resetting the post injection allowable amount when filter regeneration is completed it is possible to properly perform calculation of the post injection allowable amount after completion of the filter regeneration and properly execute inhibition of the post injection and cancellation of the inhibition based on the calculated value of the post injection allowable amount.

To attain the above object in a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of reducing exhaust emissions from an internal combustion engine by collecting particulates from exhaust gases discharged from the engine which is installed on a means of transportation as a drive source into an exhaust system provided with a filter for collecting the particulates from the exhaust gases comprising a regeneration operation executing step of carrying out post injection for additionally injecting fuel into a combustion chamber of the engine after a combustion stroke of the engine to thereby perform a regeneration operation for regenerating the filter a travel distance detecting step of detecting a travel distance of the means of transportation a post injection allowable amount calculating step of calculating a post injection allowable amount indicative of an allowable amount of fuel to be injected by the post injection such that the post injection allowable amount increases in accordance with an increase in the detected travel distance a post injection allowable amount reducing step of subtracting an amount of fuel injected by the post injection from the post injection allowable amount during execution of the post injection and a post injection inhibiting step of inhibiting the post injection when the post injection allowable amount is not larger than a predetermined first threshold value.

With the configuration of the second aspect of the present invention it is possible to obtain the same advantageous effects as provided by the first aspect of the present invention.

Preferably the method further comprises a post injection inhibition canceling step of canceling the inhibition of the post injection when the post injection allowable amount becomes not smaller than a predetermined second threshold value larger than the first threshold value during the inhibition of the post injection.

Preferably the method further comprises a regeneration completion determining step of determining whether or not regeneration of the filter by the regeneration operation has been completed and a post injection allowable amount resetting step of resetting the post injection allowable amount when it is determined that the regeneration of the filter by the regeneration operation has been completed.

With the configurations of these preferred embodiments it is possible to obtain the same advantageous effects as provided by the corresponding preferred embodiments of the first aspect of the present invention.

To attain the above object in a third aspect of the present invention there is provided an engine control unit including a control program for causing a computer to execute a method of reducing exhaust emissions from an internal combustion engine by collecting particulates from exhaust gases discharged from the engine which is installed on a means of transportation as a drive source into an exhaust system provided with a filter for collecting the particulates from the exhaust gases wherein the control program causes the computer to carry out post injection for additionally injecting fuel into a combustion chamber of the engine after a combustion stroke of the engine to thereby perform a regeneration operation for regenerating the filter detect a travel distance of the means of transportation calculate a post injection allowable amount indicative of an allowable amount of fuel to be injected by the post injection such that the post injection allowable amount increases in accordance with an increase in the detected travel distance subtract an amount of fuel injected by the post injection from the post injection allowable amount during execution of the post injection and inhibit the post injection when the post injection allowable amount is not larger than a predetermined first threshold value.

With the configuration of the third aspect of the present invention it is possible to obtain the same advantageous effects as provided by the first aspect of the present invention.

Preferably the control program causes the computer to cancel the inhibition of the post injection when the post injection allowable amount becomes not smaller than a predetermined second threshold value larger than the first threshold value during the inhibition of the post injection.

Preferably the control program causes the computer to determine whether or not regeneration of the filter by the regeneration operation has been completed and reset the post injection allowable amount when it is determined that the regeneration of the filter by the regeneration operation has been completed.

With the configurations of these preferred embodiments it is possible to obtain the same advantageous effects as provided by the corresponding preferred embodiments of the first aspect of the present invention.

The above and other objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings showing a preferred embodiment thereof.

Referring to there are schematically shown an exhaust emission control system according to the present invention and an internal combustion engine hereinafter referred to as the engine to which is applied the exhaust emission control system. The engine is e.g. a four cylinder type diesel engine which is mounted on a vehicle V transport as a drive source.

The engine has a combustion chamber defined between a piston and a cylinder head . An intake pipe and an exhaust pipe exhaust system are connected to the cylinder head and a fuel injection valve hereinafter referred to as the injector is mounted through the cylinder head in a manner facing the combustion chamber

The injector is disposed in the central part of the top wall of the combustion chamber and is connected to a high pressure pump not shown and a fuel tank not shown in the mentioned order via a common rail not shown . Fuel in the fuel tank is pressurized by the high pressure pump and then sent to the injector via the common rail to be injected from the injector into the combustion chamber . A fuel injection amount QINJ and injection timing of the injector are controlled by an ECU described hereinafter.

Further a magnet rotor is mounted on a crankshaft of the engine . The magnet rotor and an MRE pickup form a crank angle sensor . The crank angle sensor delivers a CRK signal and a TDC signal which are both pulse signals to the ECU in accordance with rotation of the crankshaft

Each pulse of the CRK signal is generated whenever the crankshaft rotates through a predetermined angle e.g. 1 . The ECU determines the rotational speed NE of the engine hereinafter referred to as the engine speed NE based on the CRK signal. The TDC signal is indicative of the piston of each cylinder being at a predetermined crank angle position in the vicinity of the top dead center TDC at the start of the intake stroke of the piston and in the case of the four cylinder engine of the present example it is delivered whenever the crankshaft rotates through 180 .

A catalytic converter and a filter are inserted into an exhaust pipe at respective locations in this order from upstream side. The catalytic converter is comprised of an oxidation catalyst not shown and an NOx catalyst not shown . The oxidation catalyst oxidizes HC and CO in exhaust gases and the NOx catalyst adsorbs NOx in the exhaust gases and reduces the adsorbed NOx whereby exhaust emissions are reduced.

The filter has a honeycomb core not shown formed e.g. of a porous ceramic and is configured such that it collects particulate matter hereinafter referred to as PM such as soot from exhaust gases to thereby reduce the amount of PM emitted into the air. Further the honeycomb core of the filter supports the same oxidation catalyst not shown as the oxidation catalyst of the catalytic converter . As described above since the filter supports the oxidation catalyst the temperature of the filter is raised by the oxidation reaction of the oxidation catalyst whereby PM is burned.

Further an exhaust gas temperature sensor is inserted into the exhaust pipe at a location immediately upstream of the filter . The exhaust gas temperature sensor detects a temperature TDPFG of exhaust gases immediately upstream of the filter hereinafter referred to as the pre filter gas temperature TDPFG and delivers a signal indicative of the sensed pre filter gas temperature TDPFG to the ECU .

Furthermore an accelerator pedal opening sensor detects the degree of opening or stepped on amount AP of an accelerator pedal not shown of a vehicle V hereinafter referred to as the accelerator pedal opening AP and delivers a signal indicative of the sensed accelerator pedal opening AP to the ECU and a vehicle speed sensor travel distance detecting means detects a traveling speed of the vehicle V hereinafter referred to as the vehicle speed VP and delivers a signal indicative of the sensed vehicle speed VP to the ECU . The ECU also has a DPF lamp connected thereto.

The ECU is implemented by a microcomputer comprised of an I O interface a CPU a RAM and a ROM. The detection signals from the aforementioned sensors to are input to the CPU after the I O interface performs A D conversion and waveform shaping thereon.

In response to these input signals the CPU executes a regeneration control process for controlling a regeneration operation for regenerating the filter in accordance with control programs read from the ROM. In this process the filter regeneration operation is performed through post injection for additionally injecting fuel into the combustion chamber during the expansion stroke and or the exhaust stroke of each cylinder. The amount QPOST of fuel to be injected through the post injection hereinafter referred to as the post injection amount POSTQ is controlled based on the pre filter gas temperature TDPFG such that the temperature of the filter becomes equal to a target temperature e.g. 600 C. . Thus the filter is controlled to be in a high temperature condition so as to burn PM deposited thereon whereby the filter is regenerated.

In the present embodiment the ECU corresponds to the regeneration operation executing means the travel distance detecting means post injection allowable amount calculating means post injection allowable amount reducing means post injection inhibiting means post injection inhibition canceling means regeneration completion determining means and post injection allowable amount resetting means.

During execution of the filter regeneration operation as the amount of burned PM sharply increases to exceed the amount of discharged PM the PM deposition amount GPM progressively decreases. It should be noted that the PM deposition amount GPM is subjected to a limiting process so as to prevent the PM deposition amount GPM from becoming smaller than a value of 0.

Next it is determined whether or not a regeneration completion flag F REOK is equal to 1 step . If the answer to the question is negative NO it is determined whether or not the PM deposition amount GPM is equal to 0 step . If the answer to the question is negative NO it is determined whether or not a regeneration execution flag F REEX is equal to 1 step . If the answer to the question is negative NO it is determined whether or not the PM deposition amount GPM is not smaller than a predetermined first threshold value GPMLMT step .

On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if GPM GPMLMT holds it is judged that the PM deposition amount GPM is relatively large and the process proceeds to a step wherein it is determined whether or not the engine is in a predetermined operating condition. The predetermined operating condition corresponds to a state where the engine speed NE and the fuel injection amount QINJ are within a hatched area shown in e.g. in a low load operating region . Predetermined engine speeds NE and NE in are set to e.g. 1000 rpm and 4000 rpm respectively and a predetermined fuel injection amount QINJ is set to approximately 70 of a fuel injection amount in full load operation for example.

If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO it is judged that the engine is not in the predetermined operating condition suitable for regeneration operation and the step is executed followed by the process proceeding to the step . In this case it is sometimes determined in the step S that the PM deposition amount GPM is not smaller than the second threshold value GPMLMT i.e. if the answer to the question of the step can be affirmative YES and if so it is determined whether or not a regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP is equal to 1 step . This regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP is set to 1 when it is determined during a filter regeneration operation in a process described in detail hereinafter with reference to that the regeneration operation is to be inhibited.

If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO the DPF lamp is flashed step followed by terminating the present process. The DPF lamp is thus flashed for the purpose of notifying the driver of an extreme increase in the PM deposition amount GPM and recommending him her to drive the vehicle V in a suburb for example so as to enable the filter regeneration operation.

On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if the regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP is equal to 1 the present process is immediately terminated without flashing the DPF lamp . When the regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP is equal to 1 the filter regeneration is inhibited regardless of the PM deposition amount GPM. Therefore flashing of the DPF lamp is disabled so as to prevent the driver from taking an unnecessary action for filter regeneration.

If the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if the PM deposition amount GPM is relatively large which means that the engine is in the predetermined operating condition suitable for regeneration operation it is determined whether or not the regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP is equal to 1 step .

If the answer to the question is negative NO a post injection amount QPOST is set step so as to carry out the filter regeneration operation and the regeneration execution flag F REEX is set to 1 step . As a consequence the filter regeneration operation is executed whereby the filter is regenerated. Then the process proceeds to the steps et seq. Further the execution of the step makes the answer to the question of the step affirmative YES and therefore the process skips over the step to the step .

On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if the regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP has become equal to 1 the post injection amount QPOST is set to 0 step to thereby inhibit the post injection followed by the process proceeding to the steps et seq.

If the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if the PM deposition amount GPM has become equal to 0 it is judged that the filter regeneration operation is to be stopped and the regeneration execution flag F REEX is set to 0 step . Further a post injection allowable amount QREF referred to hereinafter is reset to 0 step and then the regeneration completion flag F REOK is set to 1 step so as to indicate that the regeneration of the filter has been completed followed by the process proceeding to the steps et seq.

As described above the filter regeneration operation is started when the PM deposition amount GPM becomes equal to or larger than the first threshold value GPMLMT and the engine is in the predetermined operating condition and is terminated when the regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP is set to 1 or when the PM deposition amount GPM becomes equal to 0 which means that the regeneration of the filter is completed.

Next the calculated TDC distance DIST is multiplied by a predetermined coefficient K and a value obtained by the multiplication is added to the immediately preceding value of the post injection allowable amount QREF QREF K DIST whereby the current value of the post injection allowable amount QREF is obtained step . As described hereinbefore during operation of the engine fuel mixed into lubricating oil by post injection progressively evaporates and as the travel distance of the vehicle V is longer the amount of evaporated fuel becomes larger which reduces an oil dilution level. The value K DIST obtained by multiplying the TDC distance DIST by the coefficient K corresponds to the amount of evaporated fuel per TDC event. Further the post injection allowable amount QREF calculated by integrating the value K DIST represents an allowable amount of fuel to be injected by post injection without causing excessive oil dilution.

Then it is determined whether or not the regeneration completion flag F REOK is equal to 1 step . Immediately after completion of regeneration of the filter the regeneration completion flag F REOK is set to 1 and therefore the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES . In this case it is determined whether or not the post injection allowable amount QREF is not smaller than a predetermined third threshold value QLMT step . Immediately after completion of regeneration of the filter the post injection allowable amount QREF is reset to 0 and therefore the answer to the question of the step is negative NO . In this case the process proceeds to steps et seq.

On the other hand when the post injection allowable amount QREF increases as the vehicle V goes on traveling after completion of regeneration of the filter and becomes equal to or larger than the third threshold value QLMT the answer to the question of the step becomes affirmative YES . In this case the regeneration completion flag F REOK is set to 0 step followed by terminating the present process. As described hereinbefore when the regeneration completion flag F REOK is set to 0 the answer to the question of the step becomes negative NO whereby a next filter regeneration operation is permitted. Thus a filter regeneration operation can be prevented from being executed immediately after completion of regeneration of the filter which makes it possible to evaporate fuel mixed into lubricating oil by the immediately preceding regeneration operation in accordance with travel of the vehicle V to thereby reliably reduce oil dilution.

Further the execution of the step makes the answer to the question of the step negative NO and in this case the process proceeds to the step wherein it is determined whether or not the regeneration execution flag F REEX is equal to 1. If the answer to the question is negative NO the regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP is set to 0 step followed by terminating the present process.

On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES which means that the filter regeneration operation is permitted it is determined whether or not the regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP is equal to 1 step . If the answer to the question is negative NO i.e. if the regeneration operation is currently being executed the post injection amount QPOST is subtracted from the post injection allowable amount QREF QREF QPOST whereby the current value of the post injection allowable amount QREF is obtained step . Then it is determined whether or not the calculated post injection allowable amount QREF is not larger than a predetermined first threshold value QLMT e.g. 0 step . If the answer to the question is negative NO the present process is terminated whereas if it is affirmative YES i.e. if QREF QLMT holds the amount of fuel injected through the post injection has reached the post injection allowable amount QREF and hence there is a fear that excessive oil dilution might occur. Therefore it is judged that the regeneration operation is to be inhibited and the regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP is set to 1 step followed by terminating the present process. When the step is executed the answer to the question of the step becomes affirmative YES whereby the post injection is inhibited to inhibit the filter regeneration operation.

Further when the step is executed the answer to the question of the step also becomes affirmative YES and in this case it is determined whether or not the post injection allowable amount QREF is not smaller than a predetermined second threshold value QLMT which is larger than the first threshold value QLMT step . If the answer to the question is negative NO the present process is immediately terminated.

On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES it is judged that oil dilution is sufficiently reduced by evaporation of fuel in accordance with travel of the vehicle V after inhibiting the regeneration operation and the regeneration inhibiting flag F RESTP is set to 0 step followed by terminating the present process. Thus the inhibition of the post injection is canceled.

During execution of the regeneration operation the post injection allowable amount QREF is progressively reduced by subtraction of the post injection amount QPOST from the post injection allowable amount QREF. Then when the post injection allowable amount QREF becomes equal or smaller than the first threshold value QLMT t the answer to the question of the step becomes affirmative YES and hence the post injection is inhibited whereby the filter regeneration operation is interrupted.

After inhibiting the post injection the PM deposition amount GPM and the post injection allowable amount QREF progressively increase again in accordance with travel of the vehicle V. Then when the post injection allowable amount QREF exceeds the second threshold value QLMT t the answer to the question of the step becomes affirmative YES and hence the inhibition of the post injection is canceled whereby the regeneration operation is restarted. Thereafter the same operations as described above are repeatedly carried out. Then when the PM deposition amount GPM becomes equal to 0 t i.e. when the answer to the question of the step becomes affirmative YES it is judged that the regeneration of the filter has been completed and the regeneration operation is terminated. In this case the post injection allowable amount QREF is reset to 0.

As described above according to the present embodiment the post injection allowable amount QREF is calculated by multiplying the TDC distance DIST by the coefficient K and during execution of the post injection the post injection amount QPOST is subtracted from the post injection allowable amount QREF whereby the current value of the post injection allowable amount QREF is calculated. Therefore by inhibiting the post injection when the post injection allowable amount QREF is not larger than the first threshold value QLMT it is possible not only to reliably suppress oil dilution so as to prevent occurrence of excessive oil dilution but also to execute the post injection to the maximum possible extent.

Further when the post injection allowable amount QREF exceeds the second threshold value QLMT after inhibiting the post injection the inhibition of the post injection is canceled so that the post injection can be restarted in appropriate timing in which oil dilution is reliably reduced.

Furthermore when the PM deposition amount GPM becomes equal to 0 i.e. when regeneration of the filter is completed the post injection allowable amount QREF is reset to the minimum value of 0 on a safer side and therefore it is possible to properly perform calculation of the post injection allowable amount QREF after completion of the filter regeneration and inhibition of the post injection and cancellation of the inhibition based on the calculated value of the post injection allowable amount QREF while positively suppressing oil dilution.

In addition since the post injection allowable amount QREF is used as a parameter for determining inhibition of the post injection and cancellation of the inhibition it is possible to perform the determination with ease.

It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above but can be practiced in various forms. For example although in the above described embodiment the first threshold value QLMT for use in determining whether or not to inhibit the post injection is set to 0 the value QLMT may be set to a larger value than 0. This makes it possible to execute the post injection in earlier timing. Further although the degree of reduction of oil dilution according to the travel distance of the vehicle V is calculated by integrating the product of the TDC distance DIST and the coefficient K this is not limitative but it may be calculated by any other suitable method. Furthermore although in the above described embodiment the engine is install on the vehicle by way of example the present invention can be applied to a case where the engine is installed on other means of transportation than vehicles such as airplanes.

Moreover although in the above described embodiment the present invention is applied to the diesel engine by way of example this is not limitative but it can be applied to various types of engines such as gasoline engines and engines for ship propulsion machines such as an outboard motor having a vertically disposed crankshaft.

It is further understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing is a preferred embodiment of the invention and that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
