Users of conventional television and cable systems often employ recording systems to implement noncommercial time shifting functions of desired programs. In this way an individual is able to record a program that the individual is unable to view as it is being broadcast and watch the recorded program in a more convenient time.

One type of recording system employs a feature that enables a user to record a pre selected program by entering a unique program identification number associated with specific program. The program identification number which may be found in a printed television listing corresponds to programming information e.g. channel time duration that is employed by the recording system to record the particular program when it is broadcast.

In order to remain competitive in the home entertainment industry manufacturers and service providers have been increasing their efforts to develop improved entertainment systems. A rapidly evolving type of entertainment system relates to personal video recorder PVR system. A personal video recorder PVR system includes a large digital data storage device such as a hard disk for storing recorded audio and or video programming in digital format e.g. without a videotape . The storage device enables a viewer to effectively and efficiently implement a time shifting function so that the viewer can watch the recorded program at a more convenient time. The personal video recorder PVR system receives broadcast programs from a service provider such as in the form of cable television satellite or another source of programming. The personal video recorder PVR system may also employ a video compression system e.g. an MPEG 2 format in combination with an analog to digital converter for converting analog broadcast signals into an appropriate digital format. Alternatively or additionally the personal video recorder PVR system can receive broadcast signals in a digital format.

A personal video recorder PVR system further may provide enhanced recording capabilities and enhanced television functionality. By way of example the personal video recorder PVR system may include a virtual pausing functionality such that a user may pause a live broadcast for a period of time while the personal video recorder PVR system continues to record the live broadcast. The user may then continue watching from the point that the pause was initiated while the personal video recorder PVR system continues to record the live broadcast. Other available features can include fast forwarding through recorded programming rewinding parts of recorded programming skipping ahead through the recorded programming as well as of the enhanced television functionality.

Another feature of the personal video recorder PVR system relates to intelligent recording of programming. One example of intelligent recording enables the user to program one or more keywords that are searched for utilizing an electronic program guide stored on the personal video recorder PVR system. The personal video recorder PVR in turn automatically records shows that match the search criteria. Another recording method enables a user to select particular program to record all future broadcast episodes of that program.

Consequently as the available bandwidth for broadcast programs continues to increase service providers are continuing to increase the number of programming channels from which to choose. Additionally with the advent of high definition broadcasting modalities and the commensurate increase in the amount storage space necessary to persist such broadcast programs current storage media associated with standard personal video recorders PVRs and more particularly hand held devices with multimedia playback and record capabilities is not satisfactory.

The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed subject matter. This summary is not an extensive overview and it is not intended to identify key critical elements or to delineate the scope thereof Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Storage on handheld devices is limited and there is an ever increasing demand to store content of large size e.g. movies multimedia presentations audio files etc. on such handheld devices. The demand for storage space on such devices far outpaces available space often forcing users to repeatedly delete certain content in order to make room for new content. The subject matter as claimed in one aspect leverages remote storage facilities to effectively increased storage capacity of a handheld device. The handheld device can be synchronized with a service e.g. web based service that monitors and manages available space on the handheld device. The service can age out content likely to not be watched in the near future while still retaining a marker for such content on the handheld device. Thus if the user desires to watch aged out content the service can automatically download previously deleted content back to the handheld device. Additionally the service works in the background employing sophisticated aging policies to know when and which content should be scaled down e.g. compressed . When an item is scaled down the service does not compel the handheld device to completely discard the content rather the service causes the handheld device to maintain a tag link flag or cache to the item of interest. The size of the cache can for example be dynamically and variably dependent on Internet connection speeds. If and when the user elects to play a previously aged out and or compressed e.g. scaled down multimedia clip on the handheld device the service can designate other content persisted on storage media associated with handheld device to be compressed and or aged out initiates the download of the full requested content and begins immediate playback leveraging the cached portion to provide an uninterrupted viewing experience. The user can simply sit back and enjoy the extra movies and never needs to be bothered with managing the storage space associated with the handheld device.

In a further aspect the subject matter can provide for hot swapping large sets of files. For example the claimed subject matter can move all video content persisted on the handheld device to a remote storage media transfer selected audio content stored on the remote storage media to the handheld device and subsequently after a significant hiatus reload all the video content previously transferred to the remote storage media back to the handheld device while still maintaining the ordering e.g. full aged and or compressed media clips of all video content that were previously stored on the handheld device e.g. before the initial transfer of the video content .

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends certain illustrative aspects of the disclosed and claimed subject matter are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative however of but a few of the various ways in which the principles disclosed herein can be employed and is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

The subject matter as claimed is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding thereof. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate a description thereof.

It should be noted at the outset that the claimed subject matter has been elucidated as managing media content associated with one particular classification or type of device. Nevertheless as will be recognized by those cognizant in the art the subject matter is not so limited and can find pertinent application in a plethora of other contexts mechanisms and applications beyond the paradigm set forth herein without necessarily departing from the spirit intent and scope the subject matter as claimed. Accordingly any and all such applicability and derivations thereof is deemed to fall within the ambit of the claimed subject matter.

As illustrated virtual personal video recorder can be any type of machine or can reside and or execute on any type of machine that includes a processor. Illustrative machines that can constitute virtual personal video recorder can include Personal Digital Assistants PDAs cell phones smart phones laptop computers notebook computers consumer devices appliances industrial automation devices hand held devices desktop computers server class computing devices etc. Virtual personal video recorder as depicted can be in continuous and operative or sporadic but intermittent communication via network topology with handheld device and or remote storage media farm .

Network topology can include any viable communication and or broadcast technology for example wide and or wireless modalities and or technologies can be utilized to effectuate the subject matter as claimed. Moreover network topology can include utilization of Personal Area Networks PANs Local Area Networks LANs Campus Area Networks CAMs Metropolitan Area Networks MANs extranets intranets the Internet Wide Area Networks WANs both centralized and distributed and or any combination permutation and or aggregation thereof Additionally and or alternatively network topology can employ powerline communications wherein power distribution wires are utilized for both the simultaneous distribution of data as well as transmission of power.

Handheld device similar to virtual personal video recorder can include any device that includes a processor and that is capable of effective communications with network topology . As indicated above hand held device can include Personal Digital Assistants PDAs cell phones mobile phones smart phones multimedia and Internet enabled mobile phones notebook computers Tablet PCs laptop computers portable media devices capable of storing and or playing files in one or more media format etc. Handheld device in addition can be in continuous and or sporadic communication via network topology with virtual personal video recorder during which time handheld device can effectuate and facilitate synchronization with virtual personal video recorder .

As stated above virtual personal video recorder can be in continuous and operative and or sporadic and intermittent communication with both remote storage media farm and or handheld device . Virtual personal video recorder monitors and or manages available space associated with handheld device and or remote storage media farm . During the course of monitoring and managing space associated with handheld device and or remote storage media farm virtual personal video recorder can periodically and automatically age out multimedia content persisted on storage media affiliated with handheld device wherein aged out content is determined by the likelihood that the content will not need to be played back for the user in the near future. Further virtual personal video recorder when aging out content persisted on storage media associated with handheld device can effectively compress such content. In other words virtual personal video recorder can remove and transfer all but the initial few frames of a multimedia clip from storage media associated with handheld device to remote storage farm so as to ensure that when a user of the handheld device subsequently requests that previously aged out and or compressed content be played back on the handheld device the multimedia clip in its entirety will be presented in an uninterrupted manner such that the user does not perceive the fact that requested content had been aged out compressed and or persisted on a remote storage media farm . Accordingly emotional personal video recorder in order to effectuate this aging a process can utilize sophisticated aging policies for example through use of artificial intelligence and or machine learning modalities to ascertain when and or which content to selectively age or compress.

Interface can receive data from a multitude of sources such as for example data associated with a particular multimedia presentation client application service user client device and or entity involved with a particular transaction a portion of transaction and thereafter convey the received information to management component for subsequent analysis. Additionally interface can receive information from management component regarding the management of storage media affiliated with handheld device and or the multitude of storage media that can comprise remote storage farm .

Interface can provide various adapters connectors channels communication pathways etc. to integrate the various components included in system into virtually any operating system and or database system and or with one another. Additionally interface can provide various adapters connectors channels communication modalities etc. that provide for interaction with various components that can comprise system and or any other component external and or internal data and the like associated with system .

Management component manages and or monitors available space associated with handheld device as well as remote storage media farm . Management component can periodically and automatically synchronize with handheld device to ascertain whether multimedia presentations e.g. movies audio clips multimedia fragments and the like need to be aged out from associated storage media. Management component can determine whether or not multimedia presentations should be aged off associated storage media by resorting to one or more aging policies that can utilize heuristics artificial intelligence machine learning statistical or probabilistic devices and or methodologies to ascertain the future probability and or likelihood based at least on part on a particular user s prior utilization of handheld device and or potential interest in a particular multimedia presentation that content should be archived and or removed from the associated storage media.

When aging and or archiving content from associated storage media to remote storage media farm based at least in part on a determined lack of interest on the part of a user of handheld device management component can compress content resident on handheld device . For example when management component can compress content resident on handheld device by removing content from storage media associated with handheld device management component can thereafter persist a marker e.g. a link a flag a cache containing the first few frames from the multimedia presentation identified to be archived or aged and the like so that when a user of the handheld device subsequently requests that previously locally stored but now archived compressed and or remotely persisted content be played back on the handheld device such content will be played back in an uninterrupted manner such that the user will not perceive the fact that the requested content had been aged out compressed and or persisted in remote storage media farm .

It should be noted that when management component persists a marker and or more particularly when management component creates a cache containing the first few frames from a multimedia presentation identified to be archived or aged the size of the cache created can be dependent on the Internet connection speed associated with network topology . Accordingly the cache size is dynamically determined and can be variable depending on the environment in which handheld device is operating. For instance if handheld device is operating in an environment where communication speed of network topology is very slow e.g. 300 Baud modem management component can dynamically and automatically affix the cache size to be commensurately larger than if handheld device is placed in an environment where the communication speed of network topology is exceedingly fast e.g. gigabit Ethernet communications .

Management component can also include a retrieval aspect wherein when a user elects to play aged archived or compressed and remotely persisted content management component can identify and designate other content currently persisted on storage media associated with handheld device for possible compression archival and storage on remote storage media farm downloads or retrieves requested content from remote storage media farm and instigates handheld device to start immediately playing back the requested content commencing with previously persisted frames e.g. frames that had previously been persisted in a cache .

Management component can further facilitate and effectuate hot swapping of large sets of files. For example management component can receive a request from a user to move all video content associated with handheld device to remote storage media farm load all music content or selected tracks thereof previously persisted in remote storage media farm onto handheld device and after a short but substantial hiatus during which time the user can play back the music content stored on handheld device swap out all the music content now persisted on the handheld device to remote storage media farm for all the video content previously persisted on remote storage media farm . The foregoing can be accomplished while maintaining any pre established caching ordering compression and or aging policies that were in existence prior to the initial movement of all the video content associated with handheld device .

Additionally management component can also include the recording aspect wherein the management component can selectively record broadcast media clips in high definition or standard definition. The determination as to whether or not to record media clips in high definition standard definition can be dependent upon factors such as free space associated with handheld device speed of the communication network retrieval rates from remote storage media farm for example.

Additional functionalities of management component can include an ability to search or surf across live and recorded cached content for selected items e.g. multimedia fragments of interest to the user. For instance a user may wish to locate all multimedia clips related to Neolithic peoples in Sub Saharan Africa for example. Accordingly management component can identify locate and play these selected clips after searching storage media associated with handheld device and remote storage media farm .

Aging component can periodically and or continuously monitor storage media associated with handheld device to determine whether or not multimedia presentations stored thereon need to be aged out. Aging component can determine whether or not multimedia presentation should be aged off associated storage media by utilizing one or more aging policies. Such aging policies can utilize artificial intelligence machine learning statistical and or probabilistic methodologies heuristics and the like to ascertain the future probability and or likelihood that identify content should be archived aged out and or removed from storage media associated with handheld device . Additionally the aging policies can be based at least in part on a particular user s prior utilization of handheld device and or potential interest in a particular multimedia presentation.

Further aging component when aging archiving and or transferring content from associated storage media to remote storage media farm prior to removal all frames can compress content resident on handheld device . For instance aging component can compress content resident on handheld device by deleting all but the first few frames of the multimedia presentation which can be persisted in a cache that remains on storage media associated with handheld device . This small cache containing the first few frames of the multimedia presentation can be utilized to provide uninterrupted viewing of aged out removed and compressed content when a user elicits a request to view the content at some future date.

Management component and further include retrieval component that can be deployed where a user elects to play previously aged out archived and or compressed and remotely persisted content. Retrieval component when a user elicits a desire to play such content can identify and designate other content currently persisted on storage media associated with handheld device for subsequent and possible compression archival and remote storage on storage media farm . Retrieval component can further effectuate download of requested content from remote storage media farm

Additionally management component can also include a playback component that based on a user request to play currently extant and stored content previously aged out archived and or compressed and remotely persisted content and or content that is currently being broadcast can cause handheld device to start immediate playback of the requested of content. Where a user requests playback of previously aged out archived and or compressed and remotely persisted content playback component can utilize stored tags flags links etc. to commence playback with the first few frames that had previously been cached and persisted on storage media associated with handheld device .

Management component can further include search component that provide users the ability to search extant and stored content previously aged out archived and or compressed and remotely persisted content and or content that is currently being broadcast e.g. live content for items of interest to the user. For example the search component can utilize various metadata e.g. closed captioning information associated with the various multimedia clips to facilitate the search. Where items of interest are identified search component can provide indication to playback component to instigate handheld device to start immediate playback of the identified of content.

Moreover management component can also include digital rights management component . Digital rights management component can enforce and control access to digital data e.g. multimedia clips movies music files etc. . Such control can be effectuated through use of smart card chip card or integrated circuit technologies were in the smart card chip card integrated circuit technologies are utilized in conjunction and association with digital rights management component to a permit or deny access to extant and stored content previously aged out archived and or compressed and remotely persisted content and or content that is currently being broadcast e.g. live content .

Additionally management component can also include recording component wherein when broadcast media presentations are recorded to storage media associated with handheld device recording component can indicate whether or not the broadcast media presentation should be stored in a high definition format a standard definition formation or a low definition format. The determination as to whether or not presentations are stored in high definition standard definition or low definition format can be dependent on factors such as free space available on storage media associated with handheld device retrieval and storage rates associated with remote storage media farm and or communication speeds associated with network topology .

Furthermore management component can also include hot swapping component and facilitates and effectuates hot swapping of large sets of multimedia files. For instance hot swapping component can receive requests from users to transfer all video content associated with a particular handheld device to a remote storage media farm and load all music content stored on remote storage media onto handheld device . Thereafter once the user has tired of listening to the music transferred to handheld device for example users can indicate via hot swapping component their desire to substitute the currently persisted music content for the previously transfer video content. Hot swapping component in encompassing this facility can maintain any pre established caching ordering compression and or aging policies that were in existence prior to the initial movement of the video content associated with handheld device .

It is to be appreciated that store can be for example volatile memory or non volatile memory or can include both volatile and non volatile memory. By way of illustration and not limitation non volatile memory can include read only memory ROM programmable read only memory PROM electrically programmable read only memory EPROM electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM or flash memory. Volatile memory can include random access memory RAM which can act as external cache memory. By way of illustration rather than limitation RAM is available in many forms such as static RAM SRAM dynamic RAM DRAM synchronous DRAM SDRAM double data rate SDRAM DDR SDRAM enhanced SDRAM ESDRAM Synchlink DRAM SLDRAM Rambus direct RAM RDRAM direct Rambus dynamic RAM DRDRAM and Rambus dynamic RAM RDRAM . Store of the subject systems and methods is intended to comprise without being limited to these and any other suitable types of memory. In addition it is to be appreciated that store can be a server a database a hard drive and the like.

The independent components may be used to further fill out or span an information space and the dependent components may be employed in combination to improve quality of common information recognizing that all sensor input data may be subject to error and or noise. In this context data fusion techniques employed by data fusion component may include algorithmic processing of sensor input data to compensate for inherent fragmentation of information because particular phenomena may not be observed directly using a single sensing input modality. Thus data fusion provides a suitable framework to facilitate condensing combining evaluating and or interpreting available sensed or received information in the context of a particular application.

In view of the foregoing it is readily apparent that utilization of the context component to consider and analyze extrinsic information can substantially facilitate determining meaning of sets of inputs.

Users can also interact with regions to select and provide information via various devices such as a mouse roller ball keypad keyboard and or voice activation for example. Typically the mechanism such as a push button or the enter key on the keyboard can be employed subsequent to entering the information in order to initiate for example a query. However it is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not so limited. For example nearly highlighting a checkbox can initiate information conveyance. In another example a command line interface can be employed. For example the command line interface can prompt e.g. via text message on a display and an audio tone the user for information via a text message. The user can then provide suitable information such as alphanumeric input corresponding to an option provided in the interface prompt or an answer to a question posed in the prompt. It is to be appreciated that the command line interface can be employed in connection with a graphical user interface and or application programming interface API . In addition the command line interface can be employed in connection with hardware e.g. video cards and or displays e.g. black and white and EGA with limited graphic support and or low bandwidth communication channels.

In view of the exemplary systems shown and described supra methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter will be better appreciated with reference to the flow chart of . While for purposes of simplicity of explanation the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks it is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks as some blocks may occur in different orders and or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methodologies described hereinafter. Additionally it should be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers.

The claimed subject matter can be described in the general context of computer executable instructions such as program modules executed by one or more components. Generally program modules can include routines programs objects data structures etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Typically the functionality of the program modules may be combined and or distributed as desired in various aspects.

The claimed subject matter can be implemented via object oriented programming techniques. For example each component of the system can be an object in a software routine or a component within an object. Object oriented programming shifts the emphasis of software development away from function decomposition and towards the recognition of units of software called objects which encapsulate both data and functions. Object Oriented Programming OOP objects are software entities comprising data structures and operations on data. Together these elements enable objects to model virtually any real world entity in terms of its characteristics represented by its data elements and its behavior represented by its data manipulation functions. In this way objects can model concrete things like people and computers and they can model abstract concepts like numbers or geometrical concepts.

The benefit of object technology arises out of three basic principles encapsulation polymorphism and inheritance. Objects hide or encapsulate the internal structure of their data and the algorithms by which their functions work. Instead of exposing these implementation details objects present interfaces that represent their abstractions cleanly with no extraneous information. Polymorphism takes encapsulation one step further the idea being many shapes one interface. A software component can make a request of another component without knowing exactly what that component is. The component that receives the request interprets it and figures out according to its variables and data how to execute the request. The third principle is inheritance which allows developers to reuse pre existing design and code. This capability allows developers to avoid creating software from scratch. Rather through inheritance developers derive subclasses that inherit behaviors that the developer then customizes to meet particular needs.

In particular an object includes and is characterized by a set of data e.g. attributes and a set of operations e.g. methods that can operate on the data. Generally an object s data is ideally changed only through the operation of the object s methods. Methods in an object are invoked by passing a message to the object e.g. message passing . The message specifies a method name and an argument list. When the object receives the message code associated with the named method is executed with the formal parameters of the method bound to the corresponding values in the argument list. Methods and message passing in OOP are analogous to procedures and procedure calls in procedure oriented software environments.

However while procedures operate to modify and return passed parameters methods operate to modify the internal state of the associated objects by modifying the data contained therein . The combination of data and methods in objects is called encapsulation. Encapsulation provides for the state of an object to only be changed by well defined methods associated with the object. When the behavior of an object is confined to such well defined locations and interfaces changes e.g. code modifications in the object will have minimal impact on the other objects and elements in the system.

Each object is an instance of some class. A class includes a set of data attributes plus a set of allowable operations e.g. methods on the data attributes. As mentioned above OOP supports inheritance a class called a subclass may be derived from another class called a base class parent class etc. where the subclass inherits the data attributes and methods of the base class. The subclass may specialize the base class by adding code which overrides the data and or methods of the base class or which adds new data attributes and methods. Thus inheritance represents a mechanism by which abstractions are made increasingly concrete as subclasses are created for greater levels of specialization.

As used in this application the terms component and system are intended to refer to a computer related entity either hardware a combination of hardware and software software or software in execution. For example a component can be but is not limited to being a process running on a processor a processor a hard disk drive multiple storage drives of optical and or magnetic storage medium an object an executable a thread of execution a program and or a computer. By way of illustration both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and or thread of execution and a component can be localized on one computer and or distributed between two or more computers.

Artificial intelligence based systems e.g. explicitly and or implicitly trained classifiers can be employed in connection with performing inference and or probabilistic determinations and or statistical based determinations as in accordance with one or more aspects of the claimed subject matter as described hereinafter. As used herein the term inference infer or variations in form thereof refers generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system environment and or user from a set of observations as captured via events and or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action or can generate a probability distribution over states for example. The inference can be probabilistic that is the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher level events from a set of events and or data. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and or stored event data whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. Various classification schemes and or systems e.g. support vector machines neural networks expert systems Bayesian belief networks fuzzy logic data fusion engines . . . can be employed in connection with performing automatic and or inferred action in connection with the claimed subject matter.

Furthermore all or portions of the claimed subject matter may be implemented as a system method apparatus or article of manufacture using standard programming and or engineering techniques to produce software firmware hardware or any combination thereof to control a computer to implement the disclosed subject matter. The term article of manufacture as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer readable device or media. For example computer readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices e.g. hard disk floppy disk magnetic strips . . . optical disks e.g. compact disk CD digital versatile disk DVD . . . smart cards and flash memory devices e.g. card stick key drive . . . . Additionally it should be appreciated that a carrier wave can be employed to carry computer readable electronic data such as those used in transmitting and receiving electronic mail or in accessing a network such as the Internet or a local area network LAN . Of course those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope or spirit of the claimed subject matter.

Some portions of the detailed description have been presented in terms of algorithms and or symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and or representations are the means employed by those cognizant in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others equally skilled. An algorithm is here generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of acts leading to a desired result. The acts are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Typically though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical and or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and or otherwise manipulated.

It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like. It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the foregoing discussion it is appreciated that throughout the disclosed subject matter discussions utilizing terms such as processing computing calculating determining and or displaying and the like refer to the action and processes of computer systems and or similar consumer and or industrial electronic devices and or machines that manipulate and or transform data represented as physical electrical and or electronic quantities within the computer s and or machine s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the machine and or computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission and or display devices.

Referring now to there is illustrated a block diagram of a computer operable to execute the disclosed system. In order to provide additional context for various aspects thereof and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief general description of a suitable computing environment in which the various aspects of the claimed subject matter can be implemented.

The illustrated aspects of the claimed subject matter may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where certain tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment program modules can be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.

A computer typically includes a variety of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer and includes both volatile and non volatile media removable and non removable media. By way of example and not limitation computer readable media can comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and non volatile removable and non removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes but is not limited to RAM ROM EEPROM flash memory or other memory technology CD ROM digital video disk DVD or other optical disk storage magnetic cassettes magnetic tape magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the computer.

The interface for external drive implementations includes at least one or both of Universal Serial Bus USB and IEEE 1394 interface technologies. Other external drive connection technologies are within contemplation of the claimed subject matter.

The drives and their associated computer readable media provide nonvolatile storage of data data structures computer executable instructions and so forth. For the computer the drives and media accommodate the storage of any data in a suitable digital format. Although the description of computer readable media above refers to a HDD a removable magnetic diskette and a removable optical media such as a CD or DVD it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of media which are readable by a computer such as zip drives magnetic cassettes flash memory cards cartridges and the like may also be used in the exemplary operating environment and further that any such media may contain computer executable instructions for performing the methods of the disclosed and claimed subject matter.

These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit through an input device interface that is coupled to the system bus but can be connected by other interfaces such as a parallel port an IEEE 1394 serial port a game port a USB port an IR interface etc.

A monitor or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus via an interface such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor a computer typically includes other peripheral output devices not shown such as speakers printers etc.

The computer may operate in a networked environment using logical connections via wired and or wireless communications to one or more remote computers such as a remote computer s . The remote computer s can be a workstation a server computer a router a personal computer portable computer microprocessor based entertainment appliance a peer device or other common network node and typically includes many or all of the elements described relative to the computer although for purposes of brevity only a memory storage device is illustrated. The logical connections depicted include wired wireless connectivity to a local area network LAN and or larger networks e.g. a wide area network WAN . Such LAN and WAN networking environments are commonplace in offices and companies and facilitate enterprise wide computer networks such as intranets all of which may connect to a global communications network e.g. the Internet.

When used in a LAN networking environment the computer is connected to the local network through a wired and or wireless communication network interface or adapter . The adaptor may facilitate wired or wireless communication to the LAN which may also include a wireless access point disposed thereon for communicating with the wireless adaptor .

When used in a WAN networking environment the computer can include a modem or is connected to a communications server on the WAN or has other means for establishing communications over the WAN such as by way of the Internet. The modem which can be internal or external and a wired or wireless device is connected to the system bus via the serial port interface . In a networked environment program modules depicted relative to the computer or portions thereof can be stored in the remote memory storage device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers can be used.

The computer is operable to communicate with any wireless devices or entities operatively disposed in wireless communication e.g. a printer scanner desktop and or portable computer portable data assistant communications satellite any piece of equipment or location associated with a wirelessly detectable tag e.g. a kiosk news stand restroom and telephone. This includes at least Wi Fi and Bluetooth wireless technologies. Thus the communication can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices.

Wi Fi or Wireless Fidelity allows connection to the Internet from a couch at home a bed in a hotel room or a conference room at work without wires. Wi Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices e.g. computers to send and receive data indoors and out anywhere within the range of a base station. Wi Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11x a b g etc. to provide secure reliable fast wireless connectivity. A Wi Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other to the Internet and to wired networks which use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet .

Wi Fi networks can operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands. IEEE 802.11 applies to generally to wireless LANs and provides 1 or 2 Mbps transmission in the 2.4 GHz band using either frequency hopping spread spectrum FHSS or direct sequence spread spectrum DSSS . IEEE 802.11a is an extension to IEEE 802.11 that applies to wireless LANs and provides up to 54 Mbps in the 5 GHz band. IEEE 802.11a uses an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM encoding scheme rather than FHSS or DSSS. IEEE 802.11b also referred to as 802.11 High Rate DSSS or Wi Fi is an extension to 802.11 that applies to wireless LANs and provides 11 Mbps transmission with a fallback to 5.5 2 and 1 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz band. IEEE 802.11g applies to wireless LANs and provides 20 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz band. Products can contain more than one band e.g. dual band so the networks can provide real world performance similar to the basic 10 BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.
