title: Techniques for processing data from a multilingual database
abstract: A method, system and article of manufacture for providing natural language support for users running queries against a multilingual database. One embodiment comprises identifying one or more physical values defined by physical data in the multilingual database for a query result associated with an executed query. At least one translation function configured to transform at least a portion of the identified physical values defined in one or more different natural languages into alternative values defined in a selected language is executed. From each executed translation function, a data structure mapping at least a portion of the identified physical values to translated values defined in the selected language is identified and the translated values defining the alternative values defined in the selected language are retrieved from each identified data structure. The query result associated with the executed query including the alternative values defined in the selected language is output.
