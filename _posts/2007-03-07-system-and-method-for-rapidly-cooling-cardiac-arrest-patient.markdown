title: System and method for rapidly cooling cardiac arrest patient
abstract: A combined occlusion/infusion catheter is placed in the aorta of a cardiac arrest patient to occlude the aorta at a location just above the renal arteries/celiac trunk while rapidly infusing a liter or more of cold saline into the aorta below the occlusion. This flushes white cells from the bowel (now placed into a state of hypothermic stasis) induces hypothermia in the whole body, with perfusion pressure of the cold fluid maximized to the brain.

The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for rapidly cooling cardiac arrest patients.

It has been discovered that the medical outcome for a patient suffering from severe brain trauma or from ischemia caused by stroke or heart attack or cardiac arrest is improved if the patient is cooled below normal body temperature 37 C. . Furthermore it is also accepted that for such patients it is important to prevent hyperthermia fever even if it is decided not to induce hypothermia.

As understood herein it may be advantageous particularly for cardiac arrest patients to immediately and rapidly perfuse one or more critical organs with cold fluid. The present invention also understands that owing to the structure of the arterial system it may be necessary to provide a means to maintain the cold fluid in a desired body location for at least a limited time. With these critical recognitions in mind the invention herein is provided.

A method includes advancing a combined occlusion infusion catheter into the aorta of a cardiac arrest patient and then using the catheter to occlude the aorta at a location just above the renal arteries celiac trunk. The catheter is then used to infuse cold saline into the aorta below the occlusion.

In non limiting implementations between one and four liters of cold saline are infused through the catheter into the aorta preferably at a rate of approximately one liter per minute.

As set forth further below in some implementations the catheter can include at least an upper balloon that is inflatable once inside the aorta to substantially completely occlude the aorta. Also the catheter may include a lower balloon that can be inflated once inside the aorta to substantially completely occlude the aorta at a location just below the lower mesenteric artery. Preferably the catheter is inserted and used as rapidly as possible after the cardiac arrest if the patient is comatose regardless of the state of spontaneous circulation in the patient.

In another aspect a catheter system includes an elongated flexible body and at least an upper balloon on the body at or near a distal end thereof. An inflation lumen is formed in the body and communicates with the balloon to move the balloon from a deflated configuration wherein the balloon can be advanced into the aorta of a patient above the renal arteries to an inflated configuration wherein the balloon is sufficiently large to substantially completely occlude the aorta above the renal arteries. An infusion lumen is also formed on the body and terminates at a port below the upper balloon. With this structure a source of saline having a temperature of less than five degrees Centigrade can be placed in fluid communication with the infusion lumen and a source of inflation fluid can be placed in fluid communication with the inflation lumen.

In still another aspect a catheter is advanced into a patient s aorta after the patient has suffered cardiac arrest regardless of the state of spontaneous circulation. The method below may also be used with non arrest myocardial infarction patients. Regardless an upper balloon in a deflated configuration is advanced to a location just above the renal arteries and celiac trunk and then inflated to occlude the lower aorta above the renal arteries and celiac trunk. With the aorta blocked by the upper balloon cold biocompatible fluid is infused through the catheter into the aorta below the balloon after which the balloon is deflated and the catheter withdrawn.

The details of the present invention both as to its structure and operation can best be understood in reference to the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals refer to like parts and in which 

Referring initially to a catheter is shown advanced into the arterial system of a patient who has suffered cardiac arrest. It is preferred that the catheter is inserted and used as described below as rapidly as possible after the arrest if the patient is comatose regardless of the state of spontaneous circulation.

In non limiting implementations the catheter may further include a lower balloon located on the catheter assuming a standard adult anatomy to be disposed below the inferior mesenteric artery when the upper balloon is positioned as described above. Thus it is to be understood that the terms upper and lower are intended to convey the locations of the balloons with respect to each other relative to the patient s anatomy when the balloons are operatively disposed in the patient.

Once inflated the lower balloon thus occludes preferably completely flow of the cold fluid described below to the lower extremities and other organs below the level of the lower mesenteric artery thereby ensuring that the majority of the cold fluid flows through the enteric vascular bed. When a lower balloon is not used a higher volume of infused fluid than described below may be used.

As shown in in non limiting implementations the catheter can be advanced into the location shown through a femoral artery the associated iliac artery and into and upward in the aorta. Other vessels may be used for insertion.

Once the upper balloon and if provided the lower balloon are positioned as shown in the balloons are inflated with saline or other solution to fully occlude the aorta in the locations shown. The inflation fluid may be infused from a suitable inflation fluid source that can have a pump.

Then with the aorta blocked cold biocompatible fluid such as saline is infused through the catheter to emerge at the below described distal port of the catheter into the aorta. The cold fluid may be infused from a source of cold fluid that can include a pump. It is preferred that the infusion of the cold fluid is rapid approximately one liter per minute or faster and for a relatively short period of time e.g. two to four minutes for a total volume of between two to four liters of cold fluid. It is preferred that the infusion fluid be very cold e.g. when saline is used the temperature of the saline may be less than ten degrees Centigrade more preferably less than five degrees Centigrade and more preferably still about one to two degrees Centigrade.

After infusing the cold fluid into the aorta the balloon s are deflated and spontaneous circulation is resumed assuming the heart has not already been brought out of arrest. To this end a source of vacuum may be connected to the same line through which inflation fluid was infused and actuated to rapidly deflate the balloons. The catheter is then withdrawn from the body.

To provide a pathway for inflation fluid communication from the inflation deflation lumen in the body to the interior of the balloons respective inflation deflation ports are formed in the catheter body as shown. The ports extend completely between the inflation deflation lumen and the interiors of the balloons . More than one port per balloon may be used to promote rapid inflation and deflation.

If desired within the catheter at or near the axial location of the upper balloon e.g. at the distal tip of the catheter an ultrasonic repeater such as a crystal can be mounted by e.g. bonding the repeater to the body . In accordance with ultrasonic locating techniques known in the art an ultrasound transponder not shown can be disposed on the skin of the patient immediately below the edge of the ribs and in the anterior midline. The transponder can be activated to transmit an ultrasonic pulse that has a maximized return immediately above the location of the repeater and an indication of the maximized return can be presented to the surgeon. In this manner the catheter may be properly located above the visceral arteries.

The catheter may be coated with biocompatible coatings e.g. heparin to reduce clotting and or with antimicrobial coatings to reduce the risk of infection.

With the above disclosure in mind it will now be appreciated that use of the catheter as disclosed owing to infusing cold saline into the arteries between the balloons acts to flush white cells from the bowel as well as to place the bowel into a state of hypothermic stasis. At the same time hypothermia induction in the whole body advantageously is commenced with perfusion pressure of the cold fluid maximized to the brain.

While the particular SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RAPIDLY COOLING CARDIAC ARREST PATIENT is herein shown and described in detail it is to be understood that the subject matter which is encompassed by the present invention is limited only by the claims.
