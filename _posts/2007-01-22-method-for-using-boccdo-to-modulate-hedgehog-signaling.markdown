The present invention relates to the novel use of BOC CDO receptor proteins to modulate hedgehog signaling and their therapeutic use in various physiological conditions or disorders that are in part mediated by or result therefrom e.g. cancer .

Members of the Hedgehog Hh family of signaling molecules mediate many important short and long range patterning processes during invertebrate and vertebrate embryonic fetal and adult development. In a single hedgehog gene regulates segmental and imaginal disc patterning. In contrast in vertebrates a hedgehog gene family is involved in the control of proliferation differentiation migration and survival of cells and tissues derived from all three germ layers including e.g. left right asymmetry CNS development somites and limb patterning chondrogenesis skeletogenesis and spermogenesis.

The vertebrate family of hedgehog genes includes at least four members or paralogs of the single hedgehog gene WO 95 18856 and WO 96 17924 . Three of these members known as Desert hedgehog Dhh Sonic hedgehog Shh and Indian hedgehog Ihh apparently exist in all vertebrates including fish birds and mammals. Dhh is expressed principally in the testes both in mouse embryonic development and in the adult rodent and human Ihh is involved in bone development during embryogenesis and in bone formation in the adult and Shh is involved in multiple embryonic and adult cell types derived from all three lineages. Shh is expressed at high levels in the notochoard and Doorplate of developing vertebrate embryos and directs cell fate in the developing limb somites and neural tube. In vitro explant assays as well as ectopic expression of Shh in transgenic animals show that Shh plays a key role in neural tube patterning Echelard et al. 1993 75 1417 30 1993 Ericson et al. 81 747 56 1995 Marti et al 375 322 25 1995 Hynes et al. 19 15 26 1997 . Hedgehog signaling also plays a role in the development of limbs Krauss et al. 75 1431 44 1993 Laufer et al. 79 1165 73 1994 somites Fan and Tessier Lavigne 79 1175 86 1994 Johnson et al. 79 1165 73 1994 lungs Bellusci et al. 124 53 63 1997 and skin Oro et al. 276 817 21 1997 . Likewise Ihh and Dhh are involved in bone gut and germinal cell development Apelqvist et al. 7 801 804 1997 Bellusci et al. 124 53 63 1997 Bitgood et al. 6 298 304 1996 Roberts et al. 121 3163 74 1995 . Specifically Ihh has been implicated in chrondrocyte development Vortkamp et al. 273 613 22 1996 while Dhh plays a key role in testes development.

Hedgehog signaling occurs through the interaction of hedgehog protein e.g. in mammals Shh Dhh Ihh collectively Hh with the hedgehog receptor patched Ptch and the co receptor Smoothened Smo . There are two mammalian homologs of Ptch Ptch 1 and Ptch 2 collectively Ptch both of which are 12 transmembrane proteins containing a sterol sensing domain Motoyama et al. 18 104 106 1998 Carpenter et al. . 95 23 13630 40 1998 . The interaction of Hh with Ptch triggers a signaling cascade that results in the regulation of transcription by zinc finger transcriptions factors of the Gli family.

The binding of Hh to Ptch releases Smoothened Smo a 7 transmembrane G coupled protein to then activate an intricate intracellular signal transduction pathway. The activation of Smo then leads to signaling through a multimolecular complex including Costal2 Cos2 Fused Fu and suppressor of Fused Su Fu resulting in nuclear transport of the transcription factor Gli. Ho et al. 12 57 63 2002 Nybakken et al. 12 503 511 2002 i Altaba et al. 3 24 33 2002 . There are three known Gli transcription factors in verebrates Gli1 Gli2 and Gli3. While Gli1 is a transcriptional activator that is universally induced in Hh responsive cells Gli2 and Gli3 can act either as activators or repressors of transcription depending on the cellular context. Absent Hh signaling Gli3 is processed into a smaller nuclear transcriptional repressor that lacks the carboxy terminal domain of full length Gli3. Upon activation of Smo Gli3 protein cleavage is prevented and the full length form with transcription activation function is generated. Gli2 also encodes a repressor function in its carboxy terminally truncated form but its formation does not appear to be regulated by Hh signaling. Stecca et al 1 2 9 2002 .

Malignant tumors cancers are the second leading cause of death in the United States after heart disease Boring et al. 43 7 1993 . Cancer is characterized by the increase in the number of abnormal or neoplastic cells derived from a normal tissue which proliferate to form a tumor mass the invasion of adjacent tissues by these neoplastic tumor cells and the generation of malignant cells which eventually spread via the blood or lymphatic system to regional lymph nodes and to distant sites via a process called metastasis. In a cancerous state a cell proliferates under conditions in which normal cells would not grow. Cancer manifests itself in a wide variety of forms characterized by different degrees of invasiveness and aggressiveness.

Hedgehog signaling has been implicated in a wide variety of cancers and carcinogenesis. One example of the carcinogenic process is vascularization. Angiogenesis the process of sprouting new blood vessels from existing vasculature and arteriogenesis the remodeling of small vessels into larger conduct vessels are both physiologically important aspects of vascular growth in adult tissues Klagsbrun and D Amore 53 217 39 1991 Folkman and Shing 267 16 10931 4 1992 Beck and D Amore 11 5 365 73 1997 Yancopoulos et al. 93 5 661 4 1998 Buschman and Scaper 190 3 338 42 2000 . These processes of vascular growth are also required for beneficial processes such as tissue repair wound healing recovery from tissue ischemia and menstrual cycling. However they are also required for the development of pathological conditions such as the growth of neoplasias diabetic retinopathy rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis certain forms of macular degeneration and certain inflammatory pathologies Cherrington et al. 79 1 38 2000 . Thus the inhibition of vascular growth can inhibit cellular proliferation growth differentiation and or survival. As Hh has been shown to promote angiogenesis Hh antagonists would be expected to possess anti angiogenic properties.

The gene BOC brother of CDO or regional cell adhesion molecule related down regulated by oncogenes Cdon binding protein encodes a type I plasma membrane protein having an Ig FNIII repeating domain and which likely functions as a receptor subunit for cell cell communications. BOC protein is known to interact with CDO cell adhesion molecule related down regulated by oncogenes N cadherins and M cadherins in a cis fashion forming a receptor complex at sites of cell cell contact in myoblasts. Kang et al. 100 7 3989 3994 2003 .

Like BOC CDO is also a type I cell surface receptor protein further sharing similar similar ectodomain EC TM domain structural features such as Ig repeats and Fibronectin FN type III repeats. More precisely as shown in BOC has five Ig repeats and 3 FN repeats while CDO has four Ig repeats and three FNIII repeats. However the intracellular domains of BOC and CDO do not share significant homology. SiRNA knockdown of CDO in leads to loss of hedgehog signaling responses. Lum et al. 299 2039 2044 2003 . Others have shown that mutation of CDO in mammals results in a microform of holoprosencephaly HPE which is suggestive of involvement in hedgehog signaling. Cole et al. 13 411 415 2003 . However while HPE is a phenotype of hedgehog signaling failure Cole et al. also points out that less than 15 of all cases of naturally occurring HPE result from mutations in hedgehog signaling components. Thus HPE alone is not definitive of involvement in hedgehog signaling.

During embryonic development BOC and CDO are expressed in the musculoskeletal and central nervous systems and in areas of proliferation and differentiation. BOC and CDO has further been associated with myogenic differentiation Kang et al 21 1 2 114 124 2002 and macrophage defects PCT US2006 019651 filed 18 May 2006 . Expression of CDO and BOC in myoblast cell lines is downregulated by the ras oncogene and forced re expression of either CDO or BOC can override ras induced inhibition of myogenic differentiation. Kang et al. 143 403 413 1998 Kang et al. 21 114 124 2002 . The promyogenic properties of CDO and BOC were further shown to be present in the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD. Stable overexpression of CDO or BOC in RD cells led to enhanced expression of two markers of muscle cell differentiation troponin T and myosin heavy chain and to increased formation of elongated myosin heavy chain positive myotubes. It has further been suggested that CDO and BOC play a role in the inverse relationship between differentiation and transformation of cells in the skeletal muscle lineage. Wegorzewska et al. 37 1 1 4 2003 .

Applicants demonstrate herein that both BOC and CDO can bind to Shh and differentially regulate hedgehog signaling operating in tandem through a negative feedback mechanism. While BOC overexpression can inhibit Shh signaling to a level similar as Ptch1 overexpression CDO cyt overexpression CDO lacking the cytoplasmic domain potentiated Hh signaling at suboptimal Shh concentrations. This suggests that BOC can sequester or antagonize Hh signaling while CDO can amplify or agonize Hh signaling. Moreover BOC and CDO as well as antagonists thereof could be an effective therapeutic to treat disorders that are implicated by aberrent hedgehog signaling.

In the broadest sense the invention provides for a method of modulating hedgehog signaling using BOC and or CDO and antagonists thereof. In a more directed sense the method is expected to be applicable to the treatment of disorders or conditions related to hedgehog signaling including cancer and the pathogenesis thereof. While both BOC and CDO appear in normal physiology to bind to Hh BOC can sequester or prevent Hh from binding to its receptors e.g. Ptch 1 and Ptch 2 thereby preventing activation of the canonical hedgehog signaling pathway. In contrast CDO can amplify hedgehog signaling activity resulting from the binding of Shh to its receptors especially at suboptimal concentrations. Agents which mimic the physiological activity of BOC or antagonize CDO would be expected to antagonize hedgehog signaling while agents which inhibit BOC including preventing it from binding to Hh or agents that mimic the physiological activity of CDO would be expected to agonize hedgehog signaling.

Yet further embodiments of the present invention will be evident to the skilled artisan upon a reading of the present specification.

The present invention relates to the discovery that signal transduction pathways regulated by hedgehog signaling e.g. hedgehog patched smoothened fused suppressor of fused costal 2 etc. can be modulated by BOC and or CDO polypeptide. While not limited to this particular mechanism of action it appears that BOC may operate as a decoy receptor or sequestering agent for hedgehog thereby preventing secreted hedgehog from otherwise binding to the Hh receptors thereby initiating hedgehog signaling while CDO seems to play the opposite role potentiating or amplifying hedgehog signaling.

Thus it is specifically contemplated that the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention will not only interfere with aspects of hedgehog signal transduction activity but will likewise be capable of changing the fate of a cell or tissue that is affected by hedgehog signaling such as cells undergoing normal development or disease states that are characterized by aberrant i.e. over and or under expressing hedgehog signaling. More specifically such hedgehog signaling can occur either i as wild type hedgehog signaling such as that resulting from somatic mutation or congenital defect or ii as a result from hyperactivation of hedgehog pathway. Disorders resulting from hyperactivation of the hedgehog pathway can be attributed to mutations arising in hedgehog signaling components or inappropriate activation or stimulation that does not result from a mutation or lesion in a hedgehog signaling component. It is therefore desireable to have a method for identifying those cells in which the hedgehog pathway is hyperactive such that treatment with BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists can be efficiently targeted. One of skill in the art will readily recognize that BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists are suitable for the treatment of conditions or disorders characterized by hyperactive hedgehog signaling as well as modifying the cell fate during development by suppression of hedgehog concentration.

Alternatively such variant polypeptides will have no more than one conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the corresponding native polypeptide sequence alternatively no more than 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the native polypeptide sequence.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to the BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific BOC polypeptide sequence or CDO polypeptide sequence respectively after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein however amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech Inc. and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN 2 program is publicly available through Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. The ALIGN 2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN 2 program and do not vary.

 BOC variant polynucleotide or BOC variant nucleic acid sequence means a nucleic acid molecule which encodes a BOC polypeptide preferably active forms thereof as defined herein and which have at least about 80 nucleic acid sequence identity with a nucleotide acid sequence encoding a full length native sequence BOC polypeptide sequence identified herein or any other fragment of the respective full length BOC polypeptide sequence as identified herein such as those encoded by a nucleic acid that represents only a portion of the complete coding sequence for a full length BOC polypeptide .

 CDO variant polynucleotide or CDO variant nucleic acid sequence means a nucleic acid molecule which encodes a CDO polypeptide preferably active forms thereof as defined herein and which have at least about 80 nucleic acid sequence identity with a nucleotide acid sequence encoding a full length native sequence CDO polypeptide sequence identified herein or any other fragment of the respective full length CDO polypeptide sequence as identified herein such as those encoded by a nucleic acid that represents only a portion of the complete coding sequence for a full length CDO polypeptide . Ordinarily such variant polynucleotides i.e. either BOC or CDO will have at least about 80 nucleic acid sequence identity alternatively at least about 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 nucleic acid sequence identity with a nucleic acid sequence encoding the respective full length native sequence BOC or CDO polypeptide sequence respectively or any other fragment of the respective full length BOC or CDO polypeptide sequence identified herein. Such variant polynucleotides do not encompass the native nucleotide sequence.

 Percent nucleic acid sequence identity with respect to BOC polypeptide encoding nucleic acid sequences or CDO polypeptide encoding nucleic acid sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of nucleotides in a candidate sequence that are identical with the nucleotides in the BOC or CDO nucleic acid sequence of interest respectively after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent nucleic acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. For purposes herein however nucleic acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2. The ALIGN 2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech Inc. and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN 2 program is publicly available through Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. The ALIGN 2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN 2 program and do not vary.

In situations where ALIGN 2 is employed for nucleic acid sequence comparisons the nucleic acid sequence identity of a given nucleic acid sequence C to with or against a given nucleic acid sequence D which can alternatively be phrased as a given nucleic acid sequence C that has or comprises a certain nucleic acid sequence identity to with or against a given nucleic acid sequence D is calculated as follows 100 times the fraction W Z

where W is the number of nucleotides scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN 2 in that program s alignment of C and D and where Z is the total number of nucleotides in D. It will be appreciated that where the length of nucleic acid sequence C is not equal to the length of nucleic acid sequence D the nucleic acid sequence identity of C to D will not equal the nucleic acid sequence identity of D to C. As examples of nucleic acid sequence identity calculations Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate how to calculate the nucleic acid sequence identity of the nucleic acid sequence designated Comparison DNA to the nucleic acid sequence designated REF DNA wherein REF DNA represents a hypothetical BOC encoding nucleic acid sequence of interest Comparison DNA represents the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid molecule against which the REF DNA nucleic acid molecule of interest is being compared and N L and V each represent different hypothetical nucleotides. Unless specifically stated otherwise all nucleic acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN 2 computer program.

In other embodiments BOC variant polynucleotides or CDO variant polynucleotides are nucleic acid molecules that encode BOC polypeptides or CDO polypeptides respectively and which are capable of hybridizing preferably under stringent hybridization and wash conditions to nucleotide sequences encoding a full length BOC polypeptide or full length CDO polypeptide respectively as disclosed herein. Such variant polypeptides may be those that are encoded by such variant polynucleotides.

 Isolated when used to describe the various BOC polypeptides or CDO polypeptides disclosed herein means polypeptide that has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or non proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments such polypeptides will be purified 1 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 2 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under non reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Such isolated polypeptides includes the corresponding polypeptides in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide from its natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however such isolated polypeptides will be prepared by at least one purification step.

An isolated BOC polypeptide encoding nucleic acid or CDO polypeptide encoding nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the polypeptide encoding nucleic acid. Any of the above such isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Any such nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the specific polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells.

The term control sequences refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes for example include a promoter optionally an operator sequence and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters polyadenylation signals and enhancers.

Nucleic acid is operably linked when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous and in the case of a secretory leader contiguous and in reading phase. However enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.

 Stringency of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length washing temperature and salt concentration. In general longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence the higher the relative temperature which can be used. As a result it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions see Ausubel et al. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Wiley Interscience Publishers 1995 .

 Stringent conditions or high stringency conditions as defined herein may be identified by those that 1 employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing for example 0.015 M sodium chloride 0.0015 M sodium citrate 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 C. 2 employ during hybridization a denaturing agent such as formamide for example 50 v v formamide with 0.1 bovine serum albumin 0.1 Ficoll 0.1 polyvinylpyrrolidone 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride 75 mM sodium citrate at 42 C. or 3 overnight hybridization in a solution that employs 50 formamide 5 SSC 0.75 M NaCl 0.075 M sodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8 0.1 sodium pyrophosphate 5 Denhardt s solution sonicated salmon sperm DNA 50 g ml 0.1 SDS and 10 dextran sulfate at 42 C. with a 10 minute wash at 42 C. in 0.2 SSC sodium chloride sodium citrate followed by a 10 minute high stringency wash consisting of 0.1 SSC containing EDTA at 55 C.

 Moderately stringent conditions may be identified as described by Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual New York Cold Spring Harbor Press 1989 and include the use of washing solution and hybridization conditions e.g. temperature ionic strength and SDS less stringent that those described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 37 C. in a solution comprising 20 formamide 5 SSC 150 mM NaCl 15 mM trisodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 5 Denhardt s solution 10 dextran sulfate and 20 mg ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by washing the filters in 1 SSC at about 37 50 C. The ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature ionic strength etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.

The term epitope tagged when used herein refers to a chimeric polypeptide comprising a BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide fused to a tag polypeptide . The tag polypeptide has enough residues to provide an epitope against which an antibody can be made yet is short enough such that it does not interfere with the activity of the polypeptide to which it is fused. The tag polypeptide preferably also is sufficiently unique so that such antibody does not substantially cross react with other epitopes. Suitable tag polypeptides generally have at least six amino acid residues and usually between about 8 and 50 amino acid residues preferably between about 10 and 20 amino acid residues .

 Active or activity for the purposes herein refers to form s of a BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide which retain a biological and or an immunological activity of native or naturally occurring BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide respectively wherein biological activity refers to a biological function either inhibitory or stimulatory caused by a native or naturally occurring BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide respectively other than the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally occurring BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide respectively and an immunological activity refers to the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally occurring BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide respectively. An active BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide as used herein is an antigen that is differentially expressed either from a qualitative or quantitative perspective in diseased tissue e.g. tumor cancer tissue with aberrant hedgehog expression relative to its expression on similar undiseased tissue.

The term antagonist is used in the broadest sense and includes any molecule that partially or fully blocks inhibits or neutralizes preferably specifically a biological activity of target it is directed against.

 Treating or treatment or alleviation refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures wherein the object is to prevent or slow down lessen the progression of a disease. Diagnosing refers to the process of identifying or determining the distinguishing characteristics of a disease or tumor. The process of diagnosing is sometimes also expressed as staging or tumor classification based on severity or disease progression.

Subjects in need of treatment or diagnosis include those already with aberrant hedgehog signaling as well as those prone to having or those in whom aberrant hedgehog signaling is to be prevented. A subject or mammal is successfully treated for aberrant hedgehog signaling if according to the method of the present invention after receiving a therapeutic amount of a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist the patient shows observable and or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more of the following reduction in the number of tumor cells or absence of such cells reduction in the tumor size inhibition i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop of tumor cell infiltration into peripheral organs including the spread of cancer into soft tissue and bone inhibition i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop of tumor metastasis inhibition to some extent of tumor growth and or relief to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the specific cancer reduced morbidity and mortality and improvement in quality of life issues. To the extent such BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. Reduction of these signs or symptoms may also be felt by the patient.

The above parameters for assessing successful treatment and improvement in the disease are readily measurable by routine procedures familiar to a physician. For cancer therapy efficacy can be measured for example by assessing the time to disease progression TTP and or determining the response rate RR . Metastasis can be determined by staging tests and tests for calcium level and other enzymes to determine the extent of metastasis. CT scans can also be done to look for spread to regions outside of the tumor or cancer. The invention described herein relating to the process of prognosing diagnosing and or treating involves the determination and evaluation of BOC and hedgehog amplification and expression.

 Mammal for purposes of the treatment of alleviating the symptoms of or diagnosis of a cancer refers to any animal classified as a mammal including humans domestic and farm animals and zoo sports or pet animals such as dogs cats cattle horses sheep pigs goats rabbits ferrets etc. Preferably the mammal is human.

Administration in combination with one or more further therapeutic agents includes simultaneous concurrent and consecutive administration in any order.

 Carriers as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers which are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptide proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol salt forming counterions such as sodium and or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN polyethylene glycol PEG and PLURONICS .

By solid phase or solid support is meant a non aqueous matrix to which a molecule that binds BOC or CDO of the present invention can adhere or attach. Examples of solid phases encompassed herein include those formed partially or entirely of glass e.g. controlled pore glass polysaccharides e.g. agarose polyacrylamides polystyrene polyvinyl alcohol and silicones. In certain embodiments depending on the context the solid phase can comprise the well of an assay plate in others it is a purification column e.g. an affinity chromatography column . This term also includes a discontinuous solid phase of discrete particles such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 275 149.

A liposome is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug such as a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes.

A small molecule or small organic molecule is defined herein to have a molecular weight below about 500 Daltons.

An effective amount of a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist agent is an amount sufficient to inhibit partially or entirely hedgehog signaling that is at least in part dependent upon simulation from hedgehog. Alternatively an effective amount of BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist is an amount sufficient to reduce the rate of proliferation of a cell and or rate of survival of a cell that is expressing or overexpressing hedgehog. An effective amount may be determined empirically and in a routine manner in relation to this purpose.

The term therapeutically effective amount refers to a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist or other drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a subject or mammal. In the case of hedgehog signaling the therapeutically effective amount of the drug will restore aberrant hedgehog signaling to normal physiological levels reduce the tumor size inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop the infiltration of tumor cells into peripheral tissue or organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the tumor or cancer. See the definition herein of treating . To the extent the drug may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic.

A growth inhibitory amount of a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist is an amount capable of inhibiting the growth of a cell especially tumor e.g. cancer cell either in vitro or in vivo. For purposes of inhibiting neoplastic cell growth such an amount may be determined empirically and in a routine manner.

A cytotoxic amount of a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist is an amount capable of causing the destruction of a cell especially a tumor cell e.g. cancer cell either in vitro or in vivo. For purposes of inhibiting neoplastic cell growth may be determined empirically and in a routine manner.

The term anti BOC antibody is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers for example anti BOC monoclonal antibodies including agonist and neutralizing antibodies anti BOC antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity polyclonal antibodies single chain anti BOC antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific and antigen binding fragments see below of all of the above enumerated antibodies as long as they exhibit the desired biological or immunological activity. The term anti CDO antibody is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers for example anti CDO monoclonal antibodies including antagonist and neutralizing antibodies anti CDO antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity polyclonal antibodies single chain anti CDO antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific and antigen binding fragments see below of all of the above enumerated antibodies as long as they exhibit the desired biological or immunological activity.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

The basic 4 chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains an IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer unit along with an additional polypeptide called J chain and therefore contain 10 antigen binding sites while secreted IgA antibodies can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages comprising 2 5 of the basic 4 chain units along with J chain . In the case of IgGs the 4 chain unit is generally about 150 000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N terminus a variable domain V followed by three constant domains C for each of the and chains and four Cdomains for and isotypes. Each L chain has at the N terminus a variable domain V followed by a constant domain C at its other end. The Vis aligned with the Vand the Cis aligned with the first constant dmain of the heavy chain C1 . Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a Vand Vtogether forms a single antigen binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies see e.g. 8th edition Daniel P. Stites Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parslow eds. Appleton Lange Norwalk Conn. 1994 page 71 and Chapter 6.

The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains C immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM having heavy chains designated and respectively. The and classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in Csequence and function e.g. humans express the following subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and define specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed across the approximately 110 amino acid span of the variable domains. Instead the V regions consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions FRs of 15 30 amino acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called hypervariable regions that are each 9 12 amino acids long. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three hypervariable regions which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and with the hypervariable regions from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC .

The term hypervariable region when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a complementarity determining region or CDR e.g. around about Kabat residues 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the V and around about Kabat residues 31 35B H1 50 65 H2 and 95 102 H3 in the V Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 and or those residues from a hypervariable loop e.g. around about Chothia residues 26 32 L1 50 52 L2 and 91 96 L3 in the V and 26 32 H1 52A 55 H2 and 96 101 H3 in the V Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 .

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and or bind the same epitope s except for possible variants that may arise during production of the monoclonal antibody such variants generally being present in minor amounts. Such monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target wherein the target binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones such as a pool of hybridoma clones phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that the selected target binding sequence can be further altered for example to improve affinity for the target to humanize the target binding sequence to improve its production in cell culture to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo to create a multispecific antibody etc. and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques including for example the hybridoma method e.g. Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 Harlow et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 recombinant DNA methods see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 phage display technologies see e.g. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 Sidhu et al. 338 2 299 310 2004 Lee et al. 340 5 1073 1093 2004 Fellouse 101 34 12467 12472 2004 and Lee et al. 284 1 2 119 132 2004 and technologies for producing human or human like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences see e.g. WO 1998 24893 WO 1996 34096 WO 1996 33735 WO 1991 10741 Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat.

 Chimeric antibodies immunoglobulins have a portion of the heavy and or light chain identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al 81 6851 6855 1984 . Humanized antibody as used herein is a subset of chimeric antibodies.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient or acceptor antibody in which hypervariable region residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region residues from a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances Fv framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance such as binding affinity. Generally the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence although the FR regions may include one or more amino acid substitutions that improve binding affinity. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR are typically no more than 6 in the H chain and in the L chain no more than 3. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Reichmann et al 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies see U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 Example 2 Zapata et al. 2 8 10 1057 1062 1995 single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments and a residual Fc fragment a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain VH and the first constant domain of one heavy chain C1 . Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding i.e. it has a single antigen binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F ab fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having divalent antigen binding activity and is still capable of cross linking antigen. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by having additional few residues at the carboxy terminus of the C1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region which region is also the part recognized by Fc receptors FcR found on certain types of cells.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable region domain in tight non covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops 3 loops each from the H and L chain that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

 Single chain Fv also abbreviated as sFv or scFv are antibody fragments that comprise the Vand Vantibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv see Pluckthun in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 Borrebaeck 1995 infra.

A BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist is a molecule that antagonizes e.g. neutralizes or impedes the native or natural function of a hedgehog polypeptide or hedgehog signaling component including for example i by blocking the ability of hedgehog to transduce a signal such as by blocking a native hedgehog ligand e.g. Shh Dhh Ihh from binding to a receptor ii by blocking a hedgehog receptor e.g. ptch 1 ptch 2 Smo etc. from transmitting to a downstream component in the hedgehog signaling pathway iii by blocking the potentiating or stimulatory activity of a positive regulatory hedgehog signaling component e.g. CDO or iv by activating or enhancing the repressive activity of a negative hedgehog signaling regulatory component e.g. BOC . The term expressly includes 1 BOC hedgehog antagonists further defined as BOC polypeptides including chimeric BOC polypeptides and certain i.e. those that do not diminish the binding between BOC and hedgehog anti BOC antibodies BOC binding antibody fragments thereof 2 CDO antagonists including anti CDO antibodies CDO binding antibody fragments antagonist CDO chimeric polypeptides CDO binding oligopeptides CDO sense antisense nucleic acid CDO binding small organic molecules CDO RNAi and or 3 any combination of the molecules of 1 or 2 . A CDO antagonist polypeptide includes an anti CDO antibody an antagonist CDO chimeric polypeptide and a CDO binding oligopeptide. Methods for identifying BOC hedgehog antagonists and CDO antagonists may comprise contacting such a polypeptide including a cell expressing it with a candidate agonist or antagonist molecule and measuring a detectable change in one or more biological activities normally associated with such polypeptide.

An interfering RNA or RNAi is RNA of 10 to 50 nucleotides in length which reduces expression of a target gene wherein portions of the strand are sufficiently complementary e.g. having at least 80 identity to the target gene . The method of RNA interference refers to the target specific suppression of gene expression i.e. gene silencing occurring at a post transcriptional level e.g. translation and includes all posttranscriptional and transcriptional mechanisms of RNA mediated inhibition of gene expression such as those described in P. D. Zamore 296 1265 2002 and Hannan and Rossi 431 371 378 2004 . As used herein RNAi can be in the form of small interfering RNA siRNA short hairpin RNA shRNA and or micro RNA miRNA .

Such RNAi molecules are often a double stranded RNA complexes that may be expressed in the form of separate complementary or partially complementary RNA strands. Methods are well known in the art for designing double stranded RNA complexes. For example the design and synthesis of suitable shRNA and siRNA may be found in Sandy et al 39 215 224 2005 .

An RNA coding region is a nucleic acid that can serve as a template for the synthesis of an RNA molecule such as a double stranded RNA complex. Preferabley the RNA coding region is a DNA sequence.

A small interfering RNA or siRNA is a double stranded RNA dsRNA duplex of 10 to 50 nucleotides in length which reduces expression of a target gene wherein portions of the first strand is sufficiently complementary e.g. having at least 80 identity to the target gene . siRNAs are designed specifically to avoid the anti viral response characterized by elevated interferon synthesis nonspecific protein synthesis inhibition and RNA degredation that oftern results in suicide or death of the cell associated with the use of RNAi in mammalian cells. Paddison et al 99 3 1443 8. 2002 .

A short hairpin RNA or shRNA is a single stranded RNA 10 to 50 nucleotides in length characertized by a hairpin turn which reduces expression of a target gene wherein portions of the RNA strand are sufficiently complementary e.g. having at least 80 identity to the target gene .

The term stem loop refers to a pairing between two regions of the same molecule base pair to form a double helix that ends in a short unpaired loop giving a lollipop shaped structure.

A micro RNA previously known as stRNA is a single stranded RNA of about 10 to 70 nucleotides in length that are initially transcribed as pre miRNA characterized by a stem loop structure which are subsequently processed into mature miRNA after further processing through the RNA induced silencing complex RISC .

A BOC binding oligopeptide or a CDO binding oligopeptide is an oligopeptide that binds preferably specifically to a BOC polypeptide or a CDO polypeptide respectively including a receptor ligand or signaling component respectively as described herein. Such oligopeptides may be chemically synthesized using known oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using recombinant technology. Such oligopeptides are usually at least about 5 amino acids in length alternatively at least about 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 amino acids in length or more. Such oligopeptides may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this regard it is noted that techniques for screening oligopeptide libraries for oligopeptides that are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 556 762 5 750 373 4 708 871 4 833 092 5 223 409 5 403 484 5 571 689 5 663 143 PCT Publication Nos. WO 84 03506 and WO84 03564 Geysen et al. 81 3998 4002 1984 Geysen et al. 82 178 182 1985 Geysen et al. in 130 149 1986 Geysen et al. 102 259 274 1987 Schoofs et al. 140 611 616 1988 Cwirla S. E. et al. 87 6378 1990 Lowman H. B. et al. 30 10832 1991 Clackson T. et al. 352 624 1991 Marks J. D. et al. 222 581 1991 Kang A. S. et al. 88 8363 1991 and Smith G. P. 2 668 1991 .

A BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist which binds a target antigen of interest e.g. hedgehog BOC or CDO is one that binds the target with sufficient affinity so as to be a useful diagnostic prognostic and or therapeutic agent in targeting a cell or tissue expressing the antigen and does not significantly cross react with other proteins. The extent of binding to a non desired marker polypeptide will be less than about 10 of the binding to the particular desired target as determinable by common techniques such as fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation RIA .

Moreover the term specific binding or specifically binds to or is specific for a particular hedgehog BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide or an epitope thereof means binding that is measurably different from a non specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured for example by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does not have binding activity. For example specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target for example an excess of non labeled target. In this case specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled target. In one embodiment such terms refer to binding where a molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope. Alternatively such terms can be described by a molecule having a Kd for the target of at least about 10M 10M 10M 10M 10M 10M 10M 10M 10M or greater.

A BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist that inhibits the growth of tumor cells expressing a hedgehog BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide or a growth inhibitory amount of any such molecule is one which results in measurable growth inhibition of cancer cells expressing hedgehog and or underexpressing the BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide respectively. Preferred compositions for use in treatment comprise growth inhibitory amounts of at least one type of BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist e.g. BOC polypeptide anti CDO antibody so as to inhibit growth of tumor cells by greater than 20 preferably from about 20 to about 50 and even more preferably by greater than 50 e.g. from about 50 to about 100 as compared to the appropriate control. In one embodiment growth inhibition can be measured at a molecule concentration of about 0.1 to 30 g ml or about 0.5 nM to 200 nM in cell culture where the growth inhibition is determined 1 10 days after exposure of the tumor cells to the antibody. Growth inhibition of glioma tumor cells in vivo can be determined in various ways such as is described in the Experimental Examples section below. An amount of any of the above molecules of this paragraph is growth inhibitory in vivo if administration of such molecule at about 1 g kg to about 100 mg kg body weight results in reduction in tumor size or tumor cell proliferation within about 5 days to 3 months from the first administration of the antibody preferably within about 5 to 30 days.

A BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist which induces apoptosis is one which induces programmed cell death of a glioma tumor cell as determined by binding of annexin V fragmentation of DNA cell shrinkage dialation of endoplasmic reticulum cell fragmentation and or formation of membrane vesicles called apoptotic bodies . The cell is usually one which overexpresses a hedgehog polypeptide. Various methods are available for evaluating the cellular events associated with apoptosis. For example phosphatidyl serine PS translocation can be measured by annexin binding DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering and nuclear chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells. Preferably the antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule which induces apoptosis is one which results in about 2 to 50 fold preferably about 5 to 50 fold and most preferably about 10 to 50 fold induction of annexin binding relative to untreated cells in an annexin binding assay.

A BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist which induces cell death is one which causes a viable tumor or cancer cell to become nonviable. Such a cell is one which expresses a hedgehog polypeptide preferably overexpresses it underexpresses a BOC polypeptide and or overexpresses a CDO polypeptide as compared to a non diseased cell. The BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide may be a transmembrane polypeptide expressed on the surface of such cancer cell or may be a polypeptide that is produced and secreted by such a cell. Cell death in vitro may be determined in the absence of complement and immune effector cells to distinguish cell death induced by antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . Thus the assay for cell death may be performed using heat inactivated serum i.e. in the absence of complement and in the absence of immune effector cells. The ability to induce cell death can be assessed relative to untreated cells by suitable techniques such as loss of membrane integrity as evaluated by uptake of propidium iodide PI trypan blue see Moore et al. 17 1 11 1995 or 7AAD. Preferred cell death inducing BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists are those which induce PI uptake in the PI uptake assay in BT474 cells.

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies arm the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. USA 95 652 656 1998 .

 Fc receptor or FcR describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. see review M. in Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 492 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al 24 249 1994 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source e.g. from blood.

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to antibodies of the appropriate subclass which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed.

A BOC deficient tumor or cancer and or CDO hyperactive tumor or cancer optionally produces insufficient levels of BOC polypeptide or excessive levels of CDO polypeptide respectively on the surface of cells thereof such that hedgehog signaling is active or hyperactive such that a BOC hedgehog antagonist or CDO antagonist can bind thereto or otherwise target and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the tumor.

In another embodiment a BOC deficient tumor or cancer and or CDO hyperactive tumor or cancer optionally produces and secretes insufficient levels of BOC polypeptide or excessive levels of CDO polypeptide respectively such that hedgehog signaling is active or hyperactive and a BOC hedgehog antagonist and or CDO antagonist can bind thereto or otherwise target and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the cancer.

A tumor that overexpresses hedgehog or in which hedgehog signaling is hyperactive is one which has significantly higher levels of hedgehog at the cell surface thereof or that produces and secretes compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may result from gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. Various diagnostic or prognostic assays that measure enhanced expression of hedgehog resulting in increased levels at the cell surface or that which is secreted such as immunohistochemistry assay using anti hedgehog antibodies FACS analysis etc. Alternatively the levels of hedgehog encoding nucleic acid or mRNA can be measured in the cell e.g. via fluorescent in situ hybridization using a nucleic acid based probe corresponding to a hedgehog encoding nucleic acid or the complement thereof FISH see WO98 45479 published October 1998 Southern blotting Northern blotting or polymerase chain reaction PCR techniques such as real time quantitative PCR RT PCR . Alternatively hedgehog polypeptide overexpression is determinable by measuring shed antigen in a biological fluid such as serum e.g using antibody based assays see also e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 933 294 issued Jun. 12 1990 WO91 05264 published Apr. 18 1991 U.S. Pat. No. 5 401 638 issued Mar. 28 1995 and Sias et al. 132 73 80 1990 . In addition to the above assays various in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated e.g. by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the therapeutic agent.

As used herein the term immunoadhesin designates antibody like molecules which combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein an adhesin with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody i.e. is heterologous and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the immunoadhesin may be obtained from any immunoglobulin such as IgG 1 IgG 2 IgG 3 or IgG 4 subtypes IgA including IgA 1 and IgA 2 IgE IgD or IgM.

The word label when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition which is conjugated directly or indirectly to the antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule so as to generate a labeled antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule. The label may be detectable by itself e.g. radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels or in the case of an enzymatic label may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable.

The term cytotoxic agent as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes e.g. At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi Pand radioactive isotopes of Lu chemotherapeutic agents enzymes and fragments thereof such as nucleolytic enzymes antibiotics and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin including fragments and or variants thereof and the various antitumor or anticancer agents disclosed below. Other cytotoxic agents are described below. A tumoricidal agent causes destruction of tumor cells.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell especially a hedgehog overexpressing of BOC underexpressing cell either in vitro or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of hedgehog expressing cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine taxanes and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C. Further information can be found in Mendelsohn and Israel eds. Chapter 1 entitled Cell cycle regulation oncogenes and antineoplastic drugs by Murakami et al. WB Saunders Philadelphia 1995 especially p. 13. The taxanes or hydroxyureataxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel TAXOTERE Rhone Poulenc Rorer derived from the European yew is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel TAXOL Bristol Myers Squibb . These molecules promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.

 Mesenchymal cells are cells of mesncymal original including fibroblasts stromal cells smooth muscle cells skeletal muscle cells cells of osteogenic origin such as chondrocytes cells of hematopoietic origin such as monocytes macrophages lymphocytes granulocytes and cells of adipose origin such as adipocytes.

 Angiogenesis is the formation of blood vessels including both the formation of a new vasculature or alteration of an existing vascular system which benefits tissue perfusion. This includes both the formation of new vessels by sprouting of endothelial cells from existing blood vessels or the remodeling of existing vessels to alter size maturity direction of flow properties to improve blood perfusion of tissue. While the latter process is sometimes referred more specifically as arterogenesis both processes are enveloped by the definition envisioned herein. Angiogenesis is a multistep process in which endothelial cells focally degrade and invade through their own basement membrane migrate through interstitial stroma toward an angiogenic stimulus proliferate proximal to the migrating tip organize into blood vesels and reattach to newly synthesized basement membrane.

The terms hedgehog signaling pathway hedgehog pathway and hedgehog signal transduction pathway as used herein interchangeably refer to the signaling cascade mediated by hedgehog and its receptors e.g. patched patched 2 and which results in changes of gene expression and other phenotypic changes typical of hedgehog activity. The hedgehog pathway may be activated in the absence of hedgehog through activation of a downstream component e.g. overexpression of Smoothened or transfections with Smoothened or Patched mutants to result in constitutive activation with activate hedgehog signaling in the absence of hedgehog .

As hedgehog is known to stimulate angiogenesis it follows based on the teachings herein that BOC and CDO which have opposite effects on hedgehog signaling activity would have opposite effects on angiogeneis. Thus BOC polypeptides would inhibit while CDO polypeptides would stimulate angiogenesis particularly when some level of hedgehog activity is necessary for angiogenesis.

Angiogenesis is fundamental to many disorders. Persistent unregulated angiogenesis occurs in a range of disease states tumor metastases and abnormal growths by endothelial cells. The vasculature created as a result of angiogenic processes supports the pathological damage seen in these diseases.

Diseases associated with or resulting from angiogenesis include ocular neovasscular disease age related macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy retinopathy of prematurity corneal graft rejection neovascular glaucoma retrolental fibroplasias epidemic keratoconjuctivitis Vitamin A deficiency contact lens overwear atopic keratitis superior limbic keratitis pterygium keratitis sicca Sjogren s syndrome acne rosacea phylectenulosis syphilis infections lipid degeneration chemical burns bacterial ulcers fungal ulcers Herpes simplex infections Herpes zoster infections protozoan infections Kaposi s sarcoma Mooren s ulcer Terrien s marginal degeneration marginal keratolysis rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus polyarteritis trauma Wegener s granulomatosis sacroidosis scleritis Stevens Johnson syndrome pemphigoid radial keratotomy corneal graph rejection rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus polyarteritis trauma Wegener s granulomatosis sarcoidosis scleritis Stevens Johnson syndrome pemphigoid radial keratotomy corneal graph rejection rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis chronic inflammation e.g. ulcerative colitis or Crohn s disease hemangioma Osler Weber Rendu disease and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasis.

Angiogenesis plays a critical role in cancer. A tumor cannot expand without a blood supply to provide nutrients and remove cellular wastes. Tumors in which angiogenesis is important include solid tumors such as rhabdomyosarcomas retinoblastoma Ewing sarcoma neuroblastoma osteosarcoma and benign tumors such as acoustic neuroma neurofibroma trachoma and pyogenic granulomas. Angiogenic factors have been found associated with several solid tumors and preventing angiogenesis could halt the growth of these tumors and the resultant damage to the animal due to the presence of the tumor. Angiogenesis is also associated with blood born tumors such as leukemias any of various actute or chronic neoplastic diseases of the bone marrow in which unrestrained proliferation of white blood cells occurs usually accompanied by anemia impaired blood clotting and enlargement of the lymph nodes liver and spleen. It is believed that angiogenesis plays a role in the abnormalities in the bone marrow that give rise to leukemia like tumors.

In addition to tumor growth angiogenesis in important in metastasis. Initially angiogenesis is important in the vascularization of the tumor which allows cancerous cells to enter the blood stream and to circulate throughout the body. After the tumor cells have left the primary site and have settled into the secondary metastatic site angiogenesis must occur before the new tumor can grow and expand. Therefore prevention of angiogenesis could lead to the prevention of metastasis of tumors and possibly contain the neoplastic growth at the primary site.

Angiogenesis is also involved in normal physiological processes such as reproduction and wound healing. Angiogenesis is an important step in ovulation and also in implantation of the blastula after fertilization. Prevention of angiogenesis could be used to induce amenorrhea to block ovulation or to prevent implanation by the blastula.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the invention are useful for the treatment and or prevention of respiratory distress syndrome or other disorders resulting from inappropriate lung surface tension. Respiratory distress syndrome results from insufficient surfactant in the alveolae of the lungs. The lungs of vertebrates contain surfactant a complex mixture of lipids and protein that causes surface tension to rise during lung inflation and decrease during lung deflation. During lung deflation surfactant decreases such that there are no surface forces that would otherwise promote alveolar collapse. Aerated alveoli that have not collapsed during expiration permit continuous oxygen and carbon dioxide transport between blood and alveolar gas and require much less force to inflate during the subsequent inspiration. During inflation lung surfactant increases surface tension as the alveolar surface areas increases. A rising surface tension in expanding alveoli opposes over inflation in those airspaces and tends to divert inspired air to less well aerated alveoli thereby facilitating even lung aeration.

Respiratory distress syndrome is particularly prevalent among premature infants. Lung surfactant in normally synthesized at a very low rate until the last six weeks of fetal life. Human infants born more than six weeks before the normal term of a pregnancy have a high risk of being born with inadequate amounts of lung surfactant and inadequate rates of surfactant synthesis. The more prematurely an infant is born the more severe the surfactant deficiency is likely to be. Severe surfactant deficiency can lead to respiratory failure within a few minutes or hours of birth. The surfactant deficiency produces progressive collapse of alveoli atelectasis because of the decreasing ability of the lung to expand despite maximum inspiratory effort. As a result inadequate amounts of oxygen reach the infant s blood. RDS can also in adults typically as a consequence of failure in surfactant biosynthesis.

Lung tissue of premature infants shows high activity of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Inhibition of this pathway using hedgehog antagonists increases the formation of lamellated bodies and increases the expression of genes involved in surfactant biosynthesis. Lamellar bodies are subsellular structures associated with surfactant biosynthesis. For these reasons treatment of premature infants with a hedgehog antagonist should stimulate surfactant biosynthesis and ameliorate RDS. In cases where adult RDS is associated with hedgehog pathway activiation treatment with BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist should also be effective.

It is further contemplated that use of BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists may be specifically targeted to disorders where the affected tissue and or cells exhibit high hedgehog pathway activation. Expression of gli genes activated by the hedgehog signaling pathway including gli 1 gli 2 and gli 3 most consistently correlate with hedgehog signaling across a wide range or tissues and disorders while gli 3 is somewhat less so. The gli genes encode transcription factors that activate expression of many genes needed to elicit the full effects of hedgehog signaling. However the Gli 3 transcription factors can also act as a repressor of hedgehog effector genes and therefore expression of gli 3 can cause a decreased effect of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Whether gli 3 acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor depends on post translational events and therefore it is expected that methods for detecting the activating form versus the repressing form of Gli 3 protein would also be a reliable measure of hedgehog pathway activation. The gli 1 gene is strongly expressed in a wide array of cancers hyperplasias and immature lungs and serves as a marker for the relative activation of the hedgehog pathway. In addition tissues such as immature lung that have high gli gene expression are strongly affected by hedgehog inhibitors. Accordingly it is contemplated that the detection of gli gene expression may be used as a powerful predictive tool to identity tissues and disorders that will particularly benefit from treatment with a hedgehog antagonist.

In preferred embodiments gli 1 expression levels are detected either by direct detection of the transcript or by detection of protein levels or activity. Transcripts may be detected using any of a wide range of techniques that depend primarily on hybrization or probes to the gli 1 transcripts or to cDNAs synthesized therefrom. Well known techniques include Northern blotting reverse transcriptase PCR and microarray analysis of transcript levels. Methods for detecting Gli protein levels include Western blotting immunoprecipitation two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2D SDS PAGE preferably compared against a standard wherein the position of the Gli proteins has been determined and mass spectroscopy. Mass spectroscopy may be coupled with a series of purification steps to allow high throughput indentification of many different protein levels in a particular sample. Mass spectroscopy and 2D SDS PAGE can also be used to identify post transcriptional modifications to proteins including proteolytic events ubiquitination phosphorylation lipid modification etc. Gli activity may also be assessed by analyzing binding to substrate DNA or in vitro transcriptional activation of target promoters. Gel shift assay DNA footprinting assays and DNA protein crosslinking assays are all methods that may be used to assess the presence of a protein capable of binding to Gli binding sites on DNA. 77 6 459 68 1999 Cell 100 4 423 34 2000 127 19 4923 4301 2000 .

In certain embodiments gli transcript levels are measured and diseased or disordered tissues showing abnormally high gli levels are treated with a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist. In other embodiments the condition being treated is known to have a significant correlation with aberrant activation of the hedgehog pathwy even though a measurement of gli expression levels is not made in the tissue being treated. Premature lung tissue lung cancers e.g. adeno carcinomas bronco alveolar adenocarcinoma small cell carcinomas breast cancers e.g. inferior ductal carcinomas inferior lobular carcinomas tubular carcinomas prostate cancers e.g. adenocarcinomas and benign prostatic hyperplasias all show strongly elevated gli 1 expression levels in certain cases. Accordingly gli 1 expression levels are a powerful diagnostic device to determine which of these tissues should be treated with a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist. In addition there is substantial correlative evidence that cancers of the urothelial cells e.g. bladder cancer other urogenital cancers wil also have elevated gli 1 levels in certain cases. For example it is known that loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9q22 is common in bladder cancers. The ptch 1 gene is located at this position and ptch 1 loss of function is probably a partial cause of hyperproliferation as in many other cancer types. Accordingly such cancers would also show high gli expression and would be particularly amenable to treatment with a hedgehog antagonist.

Expression of ptch 1 and ptch 2 is also activated by the hedgehog signaling pathway but not typically to the same extent as gli genes and as a result are inferior to the gli genes as markers of hedgehog pathway activation. In certain tissues only one of ptch 1 or ptch 2 is expressed although the hedgehog pathway is highly active. For example in testicular development desert hedgehog plays an important role and the hedgehog pathway is activated but only ptc 2 is expressed. Accordingly these genes may be individually unreliable as markers for hedgehog pathway activation although simulatenous measurement of both genes is contemplated as a more useful indicator for tissues to be treated with a hedgehog antagonist.

Because gli is so ubiquitously expressed during hedgehog activation any degree of gli overexpression should be useful in determining that a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist will be an effective therapeutic. In preferred embodiments gli should be expressed at a level at least twice as high as normal. In particularly preferred embodiments expression is four six eight or ten times as high as normal.

In light of the broad involvement of hedgehog signaling in the formation of ordered spatial arrangements of differentiated tissues in vertebrates the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention could be used in a process for generating and or maintaining an array of different vertebrate tissue both in vitro and in vivo. The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist whether inductive or anti inductive with respect to proliferation or differentiation of a given tissue type can be as appropriate any of the preparations described above.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention are further applicable to cell culture techniques wherein reduction in hedgehog signaling is desirable. In vitro neuronal culture systems have proved to be fundamental and indispensable tools for the study of neural development as well as the identification of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor NGF ciliary trophic factors CNTF and brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF . Once use of the present method may be in culture of neuronal stem cells such as in the use of such cultures for the generation of new neurons and glia. These cultures can be contacted with BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists in order to alter the rate of proliferation or neuronal stem cells in the culture and or alter the rate of differentiation or to maintain the integrity of a culture of certain terminally differentiated neuronal cells. In an exemplary embodiment the subject method can be used to culture certain neuron types e.g. sensory neurons motor neurons . Such neuronal cultures can be used as convenient assay systems as well as sources of implantable cells for therapeutic treatments.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention are further applicable to intracerebral grafting an emerging treatment for disorders of the central nervous system. For example one approach to repairing damaged brain tissues involves the transplantation of cells from fetal or neonatal animals into the adult brain. Dunnett et al. 123 265 289 1987 . Fetal neurons from a variety of brain regions can be successfully incorporated into the adult brain and such grafts can alleviate behavioral defects. For example movement disorder induced by lesions of dopaminergic projections to the basal ganglia can be prevented by grafts of embryonic dopaminergic neurons. Complex cognitive functions that are impaired after lesions of the neocortex can also be partially restored by grafts of embryonic cortical cells. The subject method can be used to regulate the growth state in the culture or where fetal tissue is used especially neuronal stem cells can be used the rate of differentiation of the stem cells.

Stem cells useful in the present invention are generally known. For example several neural crest cells have been identified some of which are multipotent and likely represent uncommitted neural crest cells and others of which can generate only one type of cell such as sensory neurons and likely represent committed progenitor cells. The role of hedgehog antagonists employed in the present method to culture such stem cells can be to regulate differentiation of the uncommitted progenitor or to regulate further restriction of the developmental fate of a committed progenitor or to regulate further restriction of the developmental fate of a committed progenitor cell towards becoming a terminally differentiated neuronal cell. For example the present method can be used in vitro to regulate the differentiation of neural crest cells into glial cells schwann cells chromaffin cells cholinergic sympathetic or parasympathetic neurons as well as peptinergic and serotonergic neurons. The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist can be used alone or in combination with other neurotrophic factors that act to more particularly enhance a particular differentiation fate of the neuronal progenitor cell.

In addition to use of the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists in combination with implantation of cell cultures another aspect of the present invention relates to the therapeutic application of BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists to regulate the growth state of neurons and other neuronal cells in both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The ability of the hedgehog pathway component e.g. ptch hedgehog and smoothened to regulate neuronal differentiation during development of the nervous system and also presumably in the adult state indicates that in certain instances the subject BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists can be expected to facilitate control of adult neurons with regard to maintenance functional performance and aging of normal cells repair and regeneration processes in chemically or mechanically lesioned cells and treatment of degeneration in certain pathological conditions. In light of this understanding the present invention specifically contemplated applications of the subject method to the treatment e.g. prevention reduction in severity etc. of neurological conditions deriving from i acute subacute or chronic injury to the nervous system including traumatic injury chemical injury vascular injury and deficits such as the isehemia resulting from stroke together with infectious inflammatory and tumor induced injury ii aging of the nervous system including Parkinson s disease Huntington s chorea amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the like as well as spinocerebellar degeneration and iv chronic immunological diseases of the nervous system or affecting the nervous system including multiple sclerosis.

As appropriate the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method can also be used in generating nerve prosthesis for the repair of central and peripheral nerve damage. In particular where a crushed or severed axon is intubulated by the use of a prosthetic device hedgehog antagonists can be added to the prosthetic device to regulate the rate of growth and regeneration of the dendritic processes. Exemplary nerve guidance channels are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 092 871 and 4 955 892.

In another embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method can be used in the treatment of neoplastic or hyperplastic transformation such as may occur in the central nervous system. For instance the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists can be utilitized to cause such transformed cells to become either post mitotic or apoptotic. The present method may therefore be used as part of a treatment for e.g. malignant gliomas meningiomas medulloblastomas neuroectodermal tumors and ependymomas.

In an alternative embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method can be used as part of a treatment regimen for malignant medulloblastoma and other primary CNS malignant neuroectodermal tumors. Medulloblastoma a primary brain tumor is the most common brain tumor in children. A medulloblastoma is a primitive neuroectodermal PNET tumor arising in the posterior fossa. They account for approximately 25 of all pediatric brain tumors. Histologically they are small round cell tumors commonly arranged in a true rosette but may display some differentiation to astrocytes ependymal cells or neurons. PNETs may arise in other areas of the brain including the pineal gland pineoblastoma and cerebrum. Those arising in the supratentorial region generally have a worsened prognosis.

Medulloblastom PNETs are known to recur anywhere in the CNS after resection and can even metastasize to bone. Pretreatment evaluation should therefore include and examination of the spinal cord to exclude the possibility of dropped metastases . Gadolinium enhanced MRI has largely replaced myelography for this purpose and CSF cytology is obtained postoperatively as a routine procedure.

In other embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method is used as part of a treatment program for ependymomas. Ependymomoas account for approximately 10 of the pediatric brain tumors in children. Grossly they are tumors that arise from the ependymal lining of the ventricles and microscopically form rosettes canals and perivascular rosettes. In the CHOP series of 51 children reported with epenymomas were histologically benign. Approximately arose from the region of the 4ventricule. One third presented in the supratentorial region. Age at presentation peaks between birth and 4 years as demonstrated by SEER data as well as date from CHOP. The median age is about 5 years. Because so many children with this disease are babies they often require multimodal therapy.

In other embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method can be used in cell culture and therapeutic method relating to the generation and maintenance of non neuronal tissue. Such uses are contemplated as a result of the involvement of hedgehog signaling components e.g. ptc hedgehog smo fused su fu Cos 2 etc. in morphogenic signals of other vertebrate organogenic pathways such as endodermal patterning and mesodermal and endodermal differentiation.

As hedgehog signaling especially ptc hedgehog and smoothened are involved in controlling the development of stem cells responsible for formation of the digestive tract liver lungs and other organs derived from the primitive gut. Shh is the inductive signal from the endoderm to the mesoderm which is critical to gut morphogenesis. Therefore for example the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the instant method can be employed for regulating the development and maintenance of an artificial liver that can have multiple metabolic functions of a normal liver. In an exemplary embodiment the subject method can be used to regulate functions of a normal liver. In an exemplary embodiment the subject method can be used to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of digestive tube stem cells to form hepatocyte cultures which can be used to populate extracellular matrices or which can be encapsulated in biocompatible polymers to form both implantable and extracorporeal artificial livers.

In another embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method can be employed therapeutically to regulate such organs after physical chemical or pathological insult. For instance therapeutics comprising BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist can be used in liver repair subsequent to a partial hepactectomy.

In another embodiment the subject method can be used to control or regulate the proliferation and or differentiation of pancreatic tissue both in vivo and in vitro. The generation of the pancreas and small intestine from the embryonic gut depends on intercellular signaling between the endodermal and mesodermal cells of the gut. In particular the differentiation of intestinal mesoderm into smooth muscle has been suggested to depend on signals from adjacent endodermal cells. One candidate mediator of endodermally derived signals in the embryonic hindgut is Sonic hedgehog Shh . Apelqvist et al. 7 801 4 1997 . The Shh gene is expressed throughout the embryonic bud endoderm with the exception of the pancreatic bud endoderm which instead expresses high levels of the homeodomain protein Ipf1 Pdx1 insulin promoter factor 1 pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 an essential regulator of early pancreatic development. The Ipf1 Pdx1 was used to selectively express Shh in the developing pancreatic epithelium. The pancreatic mesoderm of Ipf1 Pdx1 Shh transgenic mice developed into smooth muscle and insterstitial cells of Cajal cells which are characteristic of the intestine rather than pancreatic mesenchyme and spleen. Apelqvist et al. supra. Also pancreatic explants exposed to Shh underwent as similar expression of endodermally derived Shh controls the fate of adjacent mesoderm at different regions of the gut tube.

In another embodiment BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists are used to generate endodermal tissue from non endodermal stem cells including mesenchymal cells and stem cells derived from mesodermal tissues. Exemplary mesodermal tissues from which stem cells may be isolated include skeletal muscle cardiac muscle kidney cartilage and fat.

There are a wide variety of pathological cell proliferative and differentiative conditions for which the inhibitors of the present invention may provide therapeutic benefits with the general strategy being for example the correction of aberrant insulin expression or modulation of differentiation. More generally however the present invention relates to a method of inducing and or maintaining a differentiated state enhancing survival and or affecting proliferation of pancreatic cells by contacting the cells with the subject inhibitors. For instance it is contemplated by the invention that in light of the apparent involvement of ptc hedgehog and smoothened in the formation of ordered spatial arrangements of pancreatic tissues the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method could be used as part of a technique to generate and or maintain such tissue both in vitro and in vivo. For instance modulation of the function of hedgehog can be employed in both cell culture and therapeutic methods involving generation and maintenance of cells and possibly also from non pancreatic tissue such as in controlling the development and maintenance of tissue from the digestive tract spleen lungs urogenital organs e.g. bladder and other organs which derive from the primitive gut.

In a specific embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention can be used in the treatment of hyperplastic and neoplastic disorders affecting pancreatic tissue especially those characterized by aberrant proliferation of pancreatic cells. For instance pancreatic cancers are marked by abnormal proliferation of pancreatic cells which can result in alterations of insulin secretory capacity of the pancreas. For instance certain pancreatic hyperplasias such as pancreatic carcinomas can result in hypoinsulinemia due to dysfunction of cells or decreased islet cell mass. Moreover manipulation of hedgehog signaling properties at different points may be useful as part of a strategy for reshaping repairing pancreatic tissue both in vivo and in vitro. In one embodiment the present invention makes use of the apparent involvement of ptc hedgehog and smoothened in regulating the development of pancreatic tissue. In general the subject method can be employed therapeutically to regulate the pancreas after physical chemical or pathological insult. In yet another embodiment the subject method can be applied to cell culture techniques and in particular may be employed to enhance the initial generation of prosthetic pancreatic tissue devices. Manipulation of proliferation and differentiation of pancreatic tissue such as through using BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists can provide a means for more carefully controlling the characteristics of a cultured tissue. In an exemplary embodiment the subject method can be used to augment production of prosthetic devise which require islet cells such as may be used in the encapsulation devices described in for example as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 892 538 5 106 627 4 391 909 and 4 353 888. Early progenitor cells to the pancreatic islets are multipotential and apparently coactivate all the islet specific genes from the time they first appear. As development proceeds expression of islet specific hormones such as insulin becomes restricted to the pattern of expression characteristic of mature islet cells. The phenotype of mature islet cells however is not stable in culture as reappearance of embryonal traits in mature B cells can be observed. By utilizing the subject hedgehog antagonists the differentiaton path or proliferative index of the cells can be regulated.

Furthermore manipulation of the differentiative state of pancreatic tissue can be utilized in conjunction with transplantation of artificial pancreas. For instance manipulation of hedgehog function to affect tissue differentiation can be utilized as a means of maintaining graft viability.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention may be used to regulate the regeneration of lung tissue e.g. in the treatment of emphysema. It has been reported that Shh regulates lung mesenchymal cell proliferation in vivo. Bellusci et al. 124 53 1997 .

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention may also be used as part of a treatment of lung carcinoma and adenocarcinoma and other proliferative disorders involving the lung epithelia. It has been shown that Shh is expressed in human lung squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma cells. Fujita et al. 238 658 1997 . The expression of Shh was also detected in the human lung squamous carcinoma tissues but not in the normal lung tissue of the same patient. They also observed that Shh stimulates the incorporation of BrdU into the carcinoma cells and stimulates their cell growth while anti Shh H inhibited their cell growth. These results suggest that a ptc hedgehog and or smoothened is involved in cell growth of such transformed lung tissue and thereore indicates that the subject can be used as part of a treatment of lung carcinoma and adenocarcinomas and other proliferative disorders involving the lung epithelia.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention based on the involvement of hedgehog signaling in various tumors or expression of hedgehog or its receptors in such tissues during development can be treatment by the present method. Such tumors include but are not limited to tumors related to Gorlin s syndrome e.g. medulloblastoma meningioma etc. tumors evidence in ptc knock out mice e.g. hemangiona rhabdomyosarcoma etc. tumors resulting from gli 1 amplification e.g. glioblastoma sarcoma etc. tumors resulting from Smo dysfunction e.g. basal cell carcinoma etc. tumors connected with TRC8 a ptc homolog e.g. renal carcinoma thyroid carcinoma etc. Ext 1 related tumors e.g. bone cancer etc. Shh induced tumors e.g. lung cancer chondrosarcomas etc. and other tumors e.g. breast cancer urogenital cancer e.g. kidney bladder ureter prostate etc. adrenal cancer gastrointestinal cancer e.g. stomach intestine etc. .

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention may also be used to treat several forms of cancer. These cancer include but are not limited to prostate cancer bladder cancer lung cancer including small cell and non small cell colon cancer kidney cancer liver cancer breast cancer cervical cancer endometrial or other uterine cancer ovarian cancer testicular cancer cancer of the penis cancer of the vagina cancer of the urethra gall bladder cancer esophageal cancer or pancreatic cancer. Additional cancer types include cancer of skeletal or smooth muscle stomach cancer cancer of the small intestine cancer of the salivary gland anal cancer rectal cancer thyroid cancer parathyroid cancer pituitary cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer. Further exemplary forms of cancer which can be treated with the hedgehog antagonists of the present invention include cancers comprising hedgehog expressing cells. Still further exemplary forms of cancer which can be treated with the hedgehog antagonists of the present invention include cancers comprising gli expressing cells. In one embodiment the cancer is not characterized by a mutation in patched 1.

In another embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention can be used in the in vitro generation of skeletal tissue such as from skeletogenic stem cells as well as the in vivo treatment of skeletal tissue deficiencies. The present invention particularly contemplated the use of BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists to regulate the rate of chrondrogenesis and or osteogenesis. By skeletal tissue deficiency it is meant a deficiency in bone or other sketal connective tissue at any site where it is desired to restore the bone or connective tissue no matter how the deficiency originated e.g. whether as a result of surgical intervention removal of tumor ulceration implant fracture or other traumatic or degenerative conditions.

For example one suitable method is the use of the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention in a regimen for restoring cartilage function to connective tissue. Such methods are useful in for example the repair of defects or lesions in cartilage tissue which is the result of degenerative wear such as that which results in arthritis as well as other mechnical derangements which may be caused by trauma to the tissue such as a displacement of torn meniscus tissue meniscectomy a laxation of a joint by a torn ligament malignment of joint bone fracture or by hereditary disease. The present reparative method is also useful for remodeling cartilage matrix such as in plastic or reconstructive surgery as well as periodontal surgery. The present method may also be applied to improving a previous procedure for example following surgical repair of meniscus ligament or cartilage. Furthermore it may prevent the onset or exacerbation of degenerative disease if applied early enough after trauma.

In one embodiment of the present invention the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method comprises treating the afflicted connective tissue with a therapeutically effective amount of a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist in order to regulate a cartilage repair response in the connective tissue by managing the rate of differentiation and or proliferation of chondrocytes embedded in the tissue. Such connective tissues as articular cartilage interarticular cartilage menisci costal cartilage connecting the true ribs and the sternum ligaments and tendons are particularly amenable to treatment in reconstructive and or regenerative therapies using the subject method. As used herein regenerative therapies include treatment of degenerative states which have progressed to the point of which impairment of the tissue is obviously manifest as well as preventive treatments of tissue where degeneration is in its earliest stages or imminent.

In another embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method can be used as part of a therapeutic intervention in the treatment of cartilage of a diarthroidal joint such as a knee an ankle an elbow a hip a wrist a knuckly or either a finger or toe or a tempomandibular joint. The treatment can be directed to the meniscus of the joint to the articular cartilage of the joint or both. To further illustrate the subject method can be used to treat a degenerative disorder or a knee such as which might be the result of traumatic injury e.g. a sports injury or excessive wear or osteoarthritis. The subject antagonists may by administered as an injection into the joint with for instance an arthroscopic needle. In some instances the injected agent can be in the form of a hydrogel or other slow release vehicle described above in order to permit a more extended and regular contact of the agent with the treated tissue.

The present method may also be used in the field of cartilage transplantation and prosthetic device therapies. Because of the characteristics of cartilage and fibrocartilage vary between different tissues e.g. articular meniscal ligaments tendons between two ends of same ligament or tendon and between the superficial and deep parts of the tissue problems arise when these tissues are surgically repaired after injury. The zonal arrangement of these tissues may reflect a gradual change in mechanical properties and failure occurs when implanted tissue which has not differentiated under those conditions lacks the ability to appropriately respond. For example when meniscal cartilage is used to repair anterior cruciate ligaments the tissue undergoes a metaplasis to pure fibrous tissue. By regulating the rate of chondrogenesis the subject method can be used to particularly address this problem by helping to adaptively control the implanted cells in the new environment and effectively resemble hypertrophic chondrocytes of an earlier developmental stage of the tissue.

In similar fashion the subject method can be applied to enhancing both the generation of prosthetic cartilage devices and to their implantation. The need for improved treatment has motivated research aimed at creating new cartilage that is based on collagen glycosaminoglycan templates Stone et al 252 129 1990 isolated chondrocytes Grande et al. 7 208 1989 Takigawa et al. 2 449 1987 and chondrocytes attached to natural or synthetic polymers Walitani et al 71B 74 1989 Vacanti et al. 88 753 1991 von Schroeder et al. 25 329 1991 Freed et al. 27 11 1993 U.S. Pat. No. 5 041 138 . For example chondrocytes can be grown in culture on biodegradable biocompatible highly porous scaffolds formed from polymers such as polyglycolic acid polylactic acid agarose gel or other polymers that degrade over time as function of hydrolysis of the polymer backbone into innocuous monomers. The matrices are designed to allow adequate nutrient and gas exchange to the cells until engraftment occurs. The cells can be cultured in vitro until adequate cell volume and density has developed for the cells to be implanted. One advantage of the matrices is that they can be cast or molded into a desired shape on an individual basis so that the final product closely resembles the patient s own affected body portion e.g. ear nose etc. or flexible matrices can be used which allow for manipulation at the time of implantation as in a joint.

In another embodiment implants may be contacted with the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists during certain stages of the culturing process in order to manage the rate of differentiation of chondrocytes and the formation of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the culture.

In another embodiment the implanted device is treated with a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists in order to actively remodel the implanted matrix and to make it more suitable for its intended function. As set out above with respect to tissue transplants the artificial transplants suffer from the same deficiency of not being derived in a setting which is comparable to the actual mechanical environment in which the matrix is implanted. The ability to regulate the chondrocytes in the matrix by the subject method can allow the implant to acquire characteristics similar to the tissue for which it is intended to replace.

In yet another embodiment BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method are used to enhance attachment of prosthetic devices. To illustrate the subject method can be used in the implantation of a periodontal prosthesis wherein the treatment of the surrounding connective tissue stimulates formation of periodontal ligament about the prothesis.

In still further embodiments the subject method can be employed as part of a regimen for the generation of bone osteogenesis at a site in an animal where such skeletal tissue is deficient. Indian hedgehog is particularly associated with the hypertrophic chondrocytes that are ultimately replaced by osteoblasts. For instance administration of a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist of the present invention can be employed as part of a method for regulating the rate of bone loss in a subject. For example preparations comprising hedgehog antagonists can be employed for example to control endochondral ossification in the formation of a model for ossification.

In yet another embodiment a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist can be used to regulate spermatogenesis. The hedgehog proteins particularly Dhh have been shown to be involved in the differentiation and or proliferation and maintenance of testicular germ cells. Dhh expression is initiated in Sertoli cell precursors shortly after the activation of Sry testicular determining gene and persists in the testis into the adult. Males are viable but infertile owing to a complete absence of mature sperm. Examination of the developing testis in different genetic backgrounds suggests that Dhh regulated both early and late stages of spermatogenesis. Bitgood et al. 6 298 1996 . In a preferred embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist can be used as a contraceptive. In a similar fashion BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method are potentially useful for modulating normal ovarian function.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the invention also may be used in the treatment including prophylaxis of disorders afflicting epithelial tissue as well as in cosmetic uses. In general the method can be characterized as including a step of administering to an animal an amount of a hedgehog antagonist effective to alter the growth state of the treated epithelial tissue. The mode of administration and dosage regimens will vary depending on the epithelial tissue s that is to be treated. For example topical formulations will be preferred where the treated tissue is epidermal tissue such as dermal or mucosal tissues.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention are further suitable for use in modulating or promoting wound healing. Specifically promoting wound healing means a wound healing more quickly as a result of application of the treatment that a similar wound heals in the absence of the treatment. Promotion of wound healing can also mean that the method regulates the proliferation and or growth of inter alia keratinocytes or that the wound heals with less scarring less wound contractions less collagen deposition and more superficial surface area. In certain instances promotion of wound healing can also mean that certain methods of wound healing have improved success rates e.g. the take rates of skin grafts when used together with the method of the present invention.

Despite significant progress in reconstructive surgical techniques scarring can be an important obstacle in regaining normal function and appearance of healed skin. This is particularly true when pathologic scarring such as keloids or hypertrophic scars of the hands or face causes functional disability or physical deformity. In the severest of circumstances such scarring may precipitate psychosocial distress and a life of economic deprivation. Wound repair includes the stages of hemostasis inflammation proliferation and remodeling. The proliferative stage involves multiplication of fibroblasts and endothelial and epithelial cells. Through the use of the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method the rate of proliferation of epithelial cells in and proximal to the wound can be controlled in order to accelerate closure of the wound and or minimize the formation of scar tissue.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of subject method can also be effective as part of a therapeutic regimen for treating oral and paraoral ulcers e.g. resulting from radiation and or chemotherapy. Such ulcers commonly develop within days afer chemotherapy or radiation therapy. These ulcers usually begin as small painful irregularly shaped lesions usually covered by a delicate gray necrotic membrane and surrounded by inflammatory tissue. In many instances lack of treatment results in the proliferation of tissue around the periphery of the lesion on an inflammatory basis. For instance the epithelium bordering the ulcer usually demonstrates proliferative activity resulting in loss of continuity of surface epithelium. These lesions because of their size and loss of epithelial integrity dispose the body to potential secondary infection. Routine ingestion of food and water becomes a very painful event and if the ulcers proliferate throughout the alimentary canal diarrhea usually is also present with all its complicating factors. According to the present invention a treatment for such ulcers that include application of a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist can reduce the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of the affected epithelium helping to reduce the severity of subsequent inflammatory events.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method can also be used to treat wounds resulting from dermatological diseases such as lesions resulting from autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis refers to skin trauma resulting from allergies associated with an immune response caused by allergens such as pollens foods dander insect venoms and plant toxins.

In other embodiments an antiproliferative preparation of the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the invention can be used to inhibit lens epithelial cell proliferation to prevent post operative complications of extracapsular cataract extraction. Cataracts are an intractable eye disease and various studies on the treatment of cataracts have been made. However at present treatment is primarily obtained through surgery. Cataract surgeries have been applied for a long time and various operative methods have been examined. Extracapsular lense extraction has become the method of choice for removing cataracts. The major medical advantages of this technique over the intracapsular extraction is lower incidence of aphakic cystoid macular edema and retinal detachment. Extracapsular extractionis also required for implantation of posterior chamber type intraocular lenses which are now considered to be the lenses of choice in most cases.

However a disadvantage of extracapsular cataract extraction is the high incidence of posterior lens opacification often called after cataract which can occur in up to 50 of cases within three years of surgery. After cataract is caused by proliferation of equatorial and anterior capsule lens epithelial cells that remain after extracapsular lens extraction. These cells proliferate to cause Sommerling rings and along with fibroblasts which also deposit and occur on the posterior capsule cause opacification of the posterior capsule which interferes with vision. Prevention of after cataract would be preferable to treatment. To inhibit secondary cataract formation the subject method provides a means for inhibiting proliferation of the remaining lens epithelial cells. For example such cells can be induced to remain quiescent by instilling a solution contining a hedgehog antagonist preparation into the anterior chamber of the eye after lens removal. Furthermore the solution can be osmotically balanced to provide a minimally effective dosage when instilled into the anterior chamber of the eye thereby inhibiting subcapsular epithelial growth with some specificity.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the invention may also be used in the treatment of corneopathies marked by corneal epithelial cell proliferation as for example in ocular epithelial disorders such as eptithelial downgrowth or squamous cell carcinomas of the ocular surface. Hedgehog proteins have been shown to regulate mitogenesis and photoreceptor differentiation in the vertebrate retina Levine et al. 17 6277 1997 and Ihh is a candidate factor from the pigmented epithelium to promote retinal progenitor proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation. Likewise Jensen et al. 124 363 1997 demonstrated that treatment of cultures of perinatal mouse retinal cells with the amino terminal fragment of Shh protein results in an increase in the proportion of cell that incorporate bromodeoxyuridine in total cell numbers and in rod photoreceptors amacrine cells and M ller glial cells. This suggests that Shh promotes the proliferation of retinal precursor cells which means that the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention would be expected to modulate such Shh mediated proliferation. Thus the subject method can be used in the treatment of proliferative diseases of retinal cells and regulate photoreceptor differentiation.

Yet another embodiment of the invention relates to the use of the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method to control hair growth. Hair is basically composed of keratin a tough and insoluble protein. Each individual hair comprises a cylindrical shaft and a root and is contained in a follicle a flask like depression in the skin. The bottom of the follicle contains a finger like projection termed the papilla which consists of connective tissue from which hair grows and through which blood vessels supply the cells with nourishment. The shaft is the part that extends outwards from the skin surface whilst the root has been described as the buried part of the hair. The base of the root expands into the hair bulb which rests upon the papilla. Cells from which the hair is produced grow in the bulb of the follicle they are extruded in the form of fibers as the cells proliferate in the follicle. Hair growth refers to the formation and elongation of the hair fiber by the dividing cells.

As is well known in the art the common hair cycle is divided into three stages anagen catgen and telogen. During the active phase anagen the epidermal stem cells of the dermal papilla divide rapidly. Daughter cells move upward and differentiate to form the concentric layers of the hair itself. The transitional stage catagen is marked by the cessation of mitosis of the stem cells in the follicle. The resting stage is known as telogen where the hair is retained within the scalp for several weeks before an emerging new hair developing below it dislodges the telogen phase shaft from its follicle. From this model it has become clear that the larger the pool of dividing stem cells that differentiate into hair cells the more hair growth occurs. Accordingly method for increasing or reducing hair growth can be carried out by potentiating or inhibiting respectively the proliferation of these stem cells.

In certain embodiments the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method can be employed as a way of reducing the growth of human hair as opposed to its convention removal by cutting shaving or depilation. For instance BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists can be used in the treatment of trichosis characterized by abnormally rapid growth of hair e.g. hypertrichosis. In an exemplary embodiment BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists can be used to manage hirsutism a disorder marked by abnormal hairiness. The subject method can also provide a process for extending the duration of depilation.

Moreover because a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist will often be cytostatic to epithelial cells rather than cytotoxic they can be used to protect hair follicle cells from cytotoxic agents that are required progression into S phase of the cell cycle for efficacy e.g. radiation induced death. As a result treatment by BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists can provide protection by causing the hair follicle cells to become quite quiescent e.g. by inhibiting the cells from entering S phase and thereby preventing the follicle cells from undergoing mitotic catastrophe or programmed cells death. For example BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists can be used for patients undergoing chemo or radiation therapies that ordinarily result in hair loss. By inhibiting cell cycle progression during such therapies the subject treatment can protect hair follicle cells from death which might otherwise result from activation of cell death programs. After the therapy has concluded the instant method can also be removed with concomitant relief of the inhibition of follicle cell proliferation.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention can also be used in the treatment of folliculitis such as folliculitis decalvans folliculitis ulerythematosis reticulate or keloid folliculitis. For example a cosmetic preparation of a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist can be applied topically in the treatment of pseudofolliculitis a chronic disorder occurring most often in the submandibular region of the neck and associated with shaving the characteristic lesions of which are erythematous papules and pustules containing buried hairs.

In other embodiments the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists can be used as a way of increasing the growth of human hair. Sato et al. 104 855 864 1999 reported that upregulation of Shh activity in postnatal skin functions as a biologic switch that induces resting hair follicles to enter anagen with consequent hair growth. Sato et al. used an adenovirus vector AdShh to transfer the murine Shh cDNA to skin of postnatal day 19 C57BL 6 mice. The treated skin showed increased mRNA expression of Shh Patched Smo and Gli 1. In mice receiving AdShh but not in controls acceleration into anagen was evident since hair follicle size and melanogenesis increased and the hair specific keratin ghHb 1 and the melanin synthesis related tyrosinase mRNAs accumulated. Finally C57BL 6 mice showed marked acceleration of the onset of new hair growth in the region of AdShh administration to skin weeks after treatment but not in control vector treated or untreated areas. After 6 months AdShh treated skin showed normal hair and normal skin morphology. Thus the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention may be useful to regulate or modulate Shh induced hair growth.

In another aspect of the invention the subject method can be used to regulate the induction of Shh induced differentiation and or inhibit proliferation of epithelially derived tissue. Thus the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention can provide for differentiation therapy for the treatment of hyperplastic and or neoplastic conditions involving epithelial tissue. For example such preparations can be used for the treatment of cutaneous diseases in which there is abnormal proliferation or growth of cells of the skin.

For example the pharmaceutical preparations of the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the invention are intended for the treatment of hyperplastic conditions such as keratosis as well as for the treatment of neoplastic epidermal conditions such as those characterized by a high proliferation rate for various skin cancers e.g. squamous cell carcinoma. The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the invention can also be used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases affecting the skin in particular of dermatological diseases involving morbid proliferation and or keratinization of the epidermis as for example caused by psoriasis or atopic dermatosis.

Many common diseases of the skin such as psoriasis squamous cell carcinoma keratoacanthoma and actinic keratosis are characterized by localized abnormal proliferation and growth. For example in psoriasis which is characterized by scaly red elevated plaques on the skin the keratinocytes are known to proliferate much more rapidly than normal and to differentiate less completely.

In one embodiment the preparations of the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention are suitable for the treatment of dermatological ailments linked to keratinization disorders causing abnormal proliferation of skin cells which disorder may be marked by either inflammatory or non inflammatory components. BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists that promote quiescence or differentiation can be used to treat varying forms of psoriasis e.g. cutaneous mucosal or ungual. Psoriasis as described above is typically characterized by epidermal keratinocytes that display marked proliferative activation and differentiation along a regenerative pathway. Treatment with such BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist according to the present method can be used to reverse the pathological epidermal activation and can provide a basis for sustained remission of the disease.

A variety of other keratotic lesions are also candidates for treatment with the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method. Actinic keratoses for example are superficial inflammatory premalignant tumors arising on sun exposed and irradiated skin. The lesions are erythematous to brown with variable scaling. Current therapies include excisional and cryosurgery. These treatments are painful however and often produce cosmetically unacceptable scarring. Accordingly treatment of keratosis such as actinic keratosis can include application preferably topical of a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist composition in amounts sufficient to inhibit hyperproliferation of epidermal epidermoid cells of the lesion.

Acne represents yet another dermatologic ailment which may be treated by the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method. Acne vulgaris a multifactor disease most commonly occurring in teenagers and young adults is characterized by the appearance of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions on the face and upper trunk. The basic defect which gives rise to acne vulgaris is hypercornification of the duct of a hyperactive sebaceous gland. Hypercornification blocks the normal mobility of skin and follicle microorganisms and in so doing stimulates the release of lipases by and bacteria and a yeast. Treatment with an antiproliferative BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist particularly topical preparations may be useful for preventing the transitional features of the ducts e.g. hypercornification which lead to lesion formation. The subject treatment may further include for example antibiotics retinoids and antiandrogens.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention may also be used in a method treating various forms of dermatitis. Dermatitis is a descriptive term referring to poorly demarcated lesions that are either pruritic erythematous scaly blistered weeping fissured or crusted. These lesions arise from any of a wide variety of causes. The most common types of dermatitis are atopic contact and diaper dermatitis. For example seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic usually pruritic dermatitis with erythema dry moist or greasy scaling and yellow crusted patches on various areas especially the scalp with exfoliation of an excessive amount of dry scales. The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method may also be used in the treatment of stasis dermatitis an often chronic usually eczematous dermatitis. Actinic dermatitis is a dermatitis that due to exposure to actinic radiation such as that from the sun ultraviolet waves or x or gamma radiation. According to the present invention the subject method can be used in the treatment and or prevention of certain symptoms of dermatitis caused by unwanted proliferation of epithelial cells. Such therapies for these various forms of dermatitis can also include topical and systemic corticosteroids antipruritics and antibiotics. Additional skin ailments that may be treated with the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention include disorders specific to non humans such as mange.

In yet another embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the subject method can be used in regulating the activity in a noncanonical Shh pathway that is independent of the Patched Smoothened receptor complex and the Gli transcription factors. In a recent report Jarov et al 261 2 520 536 2003 describes that when Shh was immobilized to the subsrate extracellular matrix or produced by neuroepithelial cells themselves after transfection neural plate explants failed to disperse and instead formed compact structures. Changes in the adhesive capacities of neuroepithelial cells caused by Shh could be accounted for by inactivation of surface 1 integrins combined with an increase in N cadherin mediated cell adhesion. This immobilized Shh mediated adhesion does not contradict or interfere with the previously known soluble Shh mediated inductive mitogenic and trophic functions since the immobilized Shh promoted differentiation of neuroepithelial cells into motor neurons and floor plate cells with the same potency as soluble Shh. It has also been demonstrated that Shh regulation of adhesion properties during neural tube morphogenesis is rapid and reversible and it does not involve the classical Patched Smoothened Gli signaling pathway and it is independent and discernible from Shh mediated cell differentiation. Thus modifications of the adhesive properties of neural epithelial cells induced by Shh cannot be attribute to its differentiation promoting effect but reveal a novel function of Shh in this tissue that has not been described previously. Thus the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention may be used to regulate this non canonical hedgehog pathway that is independent of Ptch Smo Fu Su Fu Cos 2 and or Gli. More specifically such BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists may be used in a method to disrupt this function in neuronal or other applicable tissues preferably at specific developmental stages.

In one embodiment the present invention provides the use of anti BOC and or anti CDO antibodies which may find use herein as therapeutic diagnostic and or prognostic agents in determining the severity of and or prognosing the disease course of a BOC deficient and or CDO hyperactive tumor or cancer. Exemplary antibodies that may be used for such purposes include polyclonal monoclonal humanized bispecific and heteroconjugate antibodies. The term antibodies sometimes also include antigen binding fragments.

Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen especially when synthetic peptides are used to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized. For example the antigen can be conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent e.g. maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester conjugation through cysteine residues N hydroxysuccinimide through lysine residues glutaraldehyde succinic anhydride SOCl or RN C NR where R and Rare different alkyl groups.

Animals are immunized against the antigen immunogenic conjugates or derivatives by combining e.g. 100 g or 5 g of the protein or conjugate for rabbits or mice respectively with 3 volumes of Freund s complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with to 1 10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund s complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.

Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized as described above to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium which medium preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells also referred to as fusion partner . For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 and derivatives e.g. X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 and Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity are identified the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as for example affinity chromatography e.g. using protein A or protein G Sepharose or ion exchange chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis etc.

DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al. 5 256 262 1993 and Pl ckthun 130 151 188 1992 .

In a further embodiment monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 . Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies respectively using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity nM range human antibodies by chain shuffling Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.

The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or fusion antibody polypeptides for example by substituting human heavy chain and light chain constant domain Cand C sequences for the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 1984 or by fusing the immunoglobulin coding sequence with all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide heterologous polypeptide . The non immunoglobulin polypeptide sequences can substitute for the constant domains of an antibody or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen combining site having specificity for a different antigen.

The anti BOC antibodies useful in the practice of the invention may further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof such as Fv Fab Fab F ab or other antigen binding subsequences of antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a complementary determining region CDR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat or rabbit having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

Methods for humanizing non human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity and HAMA response human anti mouse antibody when the antibody is intended for human therapeutic use. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human V domain sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is identified and the human framework region FR within it accepted for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 151 2296 1993 Chothia et al. 196 901 1987 . Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. 151 2623 1993 .

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high binding affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to a preferred method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

Various forms of a humanized anti BOC and or anti CDO antibody ies are contemplated. For example the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment such as a Fab which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent s in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody such as an intact IgG1 antibody.

As an alternative to humanization human antibodies can be generated. For example it is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region J gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 591 669 all of GenPharm U.S. Pat. No. 5 545 807 and WO 97 17852.

Alternatively phage display technology McCafferty et al. 348 552 553 1990 can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single stranded DNA copy of the phage genome selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats reviewed in e.g. Johnson Kevin S. and Chiswell David J. 3 564 571 1993 . Several sources of V gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 isolated a diverse array of anti oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens including self antigens can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or Griffith et al. 12 725 734 1993 . See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 565 332 and 5 573 905.

As discussed above human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 567 610 and 5 229 275 .

In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance while retaining similar antigen binding specificity of the corresponding full length molecule and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and scFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind separate antigens or bind to two different epitopes of a particular BOC or CDO polypeptide described herein. Other such antibodies may combine the above BOC or CDO binding site with a binding site for another protein e.g. hedgehog . Alternatively an anti BOC and or anti CDO arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R such as Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD 16 so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the BOC or CDO expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express BOC or CDO. These antibodies possess a BOC or CDO binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

WO 96 16673 describes a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5 837 234 discloses a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RI antibody. A bispecific anti ErbB2 Fc antibody is shown in WO98 02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 teaches a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti CD3 antibody.

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Millstein et al. 305 537 539 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge C2 and C3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region C1 containing the site necessary for light chain bonding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant affect on the yield of the desired chain combination.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168 the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.

Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a Vconnected to a Vby a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the Vand Vdomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary Vand Vdomains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al 147 60 1991 . Such multiple valencies expressly includes anti BOC and anti CDO in combination with binding regions to other antigens of interest.

Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 EP 03089 . It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry including those involving crosslinking agents. For example immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl 4 mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980.

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fc region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises or consists of three to about eight but preferably four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain and preferably two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 VD2 X2 Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two and preferably four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function e.g. so as to enhance antigen dependent cell mediated cyotoxicity ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. 53 2560 2565 1993 . Alternatively an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. 3 219 230 1989 . To increase the serum half life of the antibody one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody especially an antibody fragment as described in U.S. Patent 5 739 277 for example. As used herein the term salvage receptor binding epitope refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule e.g. IgG IgG IgG or IgG that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half life of the IgG molecule.

The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising a BOC hedgehog antagonist and or CDO antagonist polypeptide conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as tolyene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids a trichothene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In one preferred embodiment a BOC hedgehog antagonist and or CDO antagonist polypeptide of the invention is conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.

In an attempt to improve their therapeutic index maytansine and maytansinoids have been conjugated to antibodies specifically binding to tumor cell antigens. Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA. 1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA. 1 maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 10HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansonid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist maytansinoid conjugates may be prepared by chemically linking an BOC CDO hedgehog antoagnist to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody or antibody fragment maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 and Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 . The linking groups include disufide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred.

Conjugates of the antibody or antibody fragment and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hyrdoxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the invention include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists. Examples include At I I Y Re ReSm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for diagnosis it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tcor I or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcm or I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as tolyene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

Alternatively a fusion protein or chimeric molecule comprising the BOC hedgehog antagonist and or CDO antagonist polypeptide may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists described herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 82 3688 1985 Hwang et al. 77 4030 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545 and WO97 38731 published Oct. 23 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556.

Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 257 286 288 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. 81 19 1484 1989 .

BOC binding oligopeptides and or CDO binding oligopeptides of the present invention are oligopeptides that bind preferably specifically to a BOC polypeptide or a CDO polypeptide respectively as described herein. Such oligopeptides may be chemically synthesized using known oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using recombinant technology. BOC binding oligopeptides and or CDO binding oligopeptides are usually at least about 5 amino acids in length alternatively at least about 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 amino acids in length or more and such oligopeptides are capable of binding preferably specifically to a BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide respectively as described herein. BOC binding oligopeptides and or CDO binding oligopeptides may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this regard it is noted that techniques for screening oligopeptide libraries for oligopeptides that are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 556 762 5 750 373 4 708 871 4 833 092 5 223 409 5 403 484 5 571 689 5 663 143 PCT Publication Nos.

In this regard bacteriophage phage display is one well known technique which allows one to screen large oligopeptide libraries to identify member s of those libraries which are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target. Phage display is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to the coat protein on the surface of bacteriophage particles Scott J. K. and Smith G. P. 1990 249 386 . The utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of selectively randomized protein variants or randomly cloned cDNAs can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Display of peptide Cwirla S. E. et al. 1990 87 6378 or protein Lowman H. B. et al. 1991 30 10832 Clackson T. et al. 1991 352 624 Marks J. D. et al. 1991 222 581 Kang A. S. et al. 1991 88 8363 libraries on phage have been used for screening millions of polypeptides or oligopeptides for ones with specific binding properties Smith G. P. 1991 2 668 . Sorting phage libraries of random mutants requires a strategy for constructing and propagating a large number of variants a procedure for affinity purification using the target receptor and a means of evaluating the results of binding enrichments.

Many other improvements and variations of the basic phage display concept have now been developed. These improvements enhance the ability of display systems to screen peptide libraries for binding to selected target molecules and to display functional proteins with the potential of screening these proteins for desired properties. Combinatorial reaction devices for phage display reactions have been developed WO 98 14277 and phage display libraries have been used to analyze and control bimolecular interactions WO 98 20169 WO 98 20159 and properties of constrained helical peptides WO 98 20036 . WO 97 35196 describes a method of isolating an affinity ligand in which a phage display library is contacted with one solution in which the ligand will bind to a target molecule and a second solution in which the affinity ligand will not bind to the target molecule to selectively isolate binding ligands. WO 97 46251 describes a method of biopanning a random phage display library with an affinity purified antibody and then isolating binding phage followed by a micropanning process using microplate wells to isolate high affinity binding phage. The use of protein A as an affinity tag has also been reported L1 et al. 1998 Mol Biotech. 9 187 . WO 97 47314 describes the use of substrate subtraction libraries to distinguish enzyme specificities using a combinatorial library which may be a phage display library. A method for selecting enzymes suitable for use in detergents using phage display is described in WO 97 09446. Additional methods of selecting specific binding proteins are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 498 538 5 432 018 and WO 98 15833.

Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening these libraries are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 723 286 5 432 018 5 580 717 5 427 908 5 498 530 5 770 434 5 734 018 5 698 426 5 763 192 and 5 723 323.

Techniques for generating the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists polypeptides antibodies polypeptides oligopeptides and organic molecules for use with the inventive method have been described above. One may further select antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof oligopeptides or other organic molecules with certain biological characteristics as desired.

The growth inhibitory effects of the various BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists useable in the invention may be assessed by methods known in the art e.g. using cells which express a BOC or CDO polypeptide either endogenously or following transfection with the respective BOC or CDO gene. For example appropriate tumor cell lines and cells transfected with BOC encoding or CDO encoding nucleic may be treated with the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the invention at various concentrations for a few days e.g. 2 7 days and stained with crystal violet or MTT or analyzed by some other calorimetric assay. Another method of measuring proliferation would be by comparing H thymidine uptake by the cells treated in the presence or absence of such BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists. After treatment the cells are harvested and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the DNA quantitated in a scintillation counter. Appropriate positive controls include treatment of a selected cell line with a growth inhibitory antibody known to inhibit growth of that cell line. Growth inhibition of tumor cells in vivo can be determined in various ways known in the art. Preferably the tumor cell is one that overexpresses a hedgehog polypeptide. Preferably such BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists will inhibit cell proliferation of a hedgehog expressing tumor cell in vitro or in vivo by about 25 100 compared to the untreated tumor cell more preferably by about 30 100 and even more preferably by about 50 100 or 70 100 in one embodiment at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml. Growth inhibition can be measured at a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml or about 0.5 nM to 200 nM in cell culture where the growth inhibition is determined 1 10 days after exposure of the tumor cells to the antagonist. The antagonist is growth inhibitory in vivo if administration of antagonist and or agonist at about 1 g kg to about 100 mg kg body weight results in reduction in tumor size or reduction of tumor cell proliferation within about 5 days to 3 months from the first administration of the antibody preferably within about 5 to 30 days.

To select for BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists which induce cell death loss of membrane integrity as indicated by e.g. propidium iodide PI trypan blue or 7AAD uptake may be assessed relative to control. A PI uptake assay can be performed in the absence of complement and immune effector cells. BOC polypeptide and or CDO expressing expressing tumor cells are incubated with medium alone or medium containing the appropriate BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist. The cells are incubated for a 3 day time period. Following each treatment cells are washed and aliquoted a into 35 mm strainer capped 12 75 tubes 1 ml per tube 3 tubes per treatment group for removal of cell clumps. Tubes then receive PI 10 g ml . Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT CellQuest software Becton Dickinson . Those BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists that induce statistically significant levels of cell death as determined by PI uptake may then be selected.

To screen for BOC hedgehog antagonists and or CDO antagonist polypeptides which bind to an epitope on a BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide respectively a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed. This assay can be used to determine if a test antibody polypeptide oligopeptide or other organic molecule binds the same site or epitope as a known BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist. Alternatively or additionally epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art. For example the antibody sequence can be mutagenized such as by alanine scanning to identify contact residues. The mutant antibody is initially tested for binding with polyclonal antibody to ensure proper folding. In a different method peptides corresponding to different regions of a BOC polypeptide or CDO polypeptide can be used in competition assays with the test antibodies or with a test antibody and an antibody with a characterized or known epitope.

The BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present invention that are antibodies may also be used in ADEPT by conjugating such an antibody to a prodrug activating enzyme which converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent see WO81 01145 to an active anti cancer drug. See for example WO 88 07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278.

The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active cytotoxic form.

Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate containing prodrugs into free drugs arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate containing prodrugs into free drugs cytosine deaminase useful for converting non toxic 5 fluorocytosine into the anti cancer drug 5 fluorouracil proteases such as serratia protease thermolysin subtilisin carboxypeptidases and cathepsins such as cathepsins B and L that are useful for converting peptide containing prodrugs into free drugs D alanylcarboxypeptidases useful for converting prodrugs that contain D amino acid substituents carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with lactams into free drugs and penicillin amidases such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups respectively into free drugs. Alternatively antibodies with enzymatic activity also known in the art as abzymes can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs see e.g. Massey 328 457 458 1987 . Antibody abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population.

The enzymes of this invention can be covalently bound to the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist antibodies by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Alternatively fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art see e.g. Neuberger et al. 312 604 608 1984 .

In addition to the BOC polypeptides and or CDO polypeptides described herein it is contemplated that variants of such molecules can be prepared for use with the invention herein. Such variants can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the encoding DNA and or by synthesis of the desired antibody or polypeptide. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that amino acid changes may alter post translational processes of these molecules such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites or altering the membrane anchoring characteristics.

Variations in amino acid sequence can be made for example using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non conservative mutations set forth for instance in U.S. Pat. No. 5 364 934. Variations may be a substitution deletion or insertion of one or more codons encoding the amino acid sequence that results in a change in the amino acid sequence as compared with the native sequence. Optionally the variation is by substitution of at least one amino acid with any other amino acid in one or more of the domains of the amino acid sequence of interest. Guidance in determining which amino acid residue may be inserted substituted or deleted without adversely affecting the desired activity may be found by comparing the sequence of the amino acid sequence of interest with homologous known protein molecules and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology. Amino acid substitutions can be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and or chemical properties such as the replacement of a leucine with a serine i.e. conservative amino acid replacements. Insertions or deletions may optionally be in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids. The variation allowed may be determined by systematically making insertions deletions or substitutions of amino acids in the sequence and testing the resulting variants for activity exhibited by the full length or mature native sequence.

Fragments of the various BOC and or CDO polypeptides are provided herein. Such fragments may be truncated at the N terminus or C terminus or may lack internal residues for example when compared with a full length native antibody or protein. Such fragments which lack amino acid residues that are not essential for a desired biological activity are also useful with the disclosed methods.

The above polypeptide fragments may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. Desired peptide fragments may be chemically synthesized. An alternative approach involves generating such fragments by enzymatic digestion e.g. by treating the protein with an enzyme known to cleave proteins at sites defined by particular amino acid residues or by digesting the DNA with suitable restriction enzymes and isolating the desired fragment. Yet another suitable technique involves isolating and amplifying a DNA fragment encoding the desired fragment by polymerase chain reaction PCR . Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed at the 5 and 3 primers in the PCR. Preferably such fragments share at least one biological and or immunological activity with the corresponding full length molecule.

In particular embodiments conservative substitutions of interest are shown in Table 5 under the heading of preferred substitutions. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in Table 5 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes are introduced and the products screened in order to identify the desired variant.

Substantial modifications in function or immunological identity of the BOC polypeptides are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or more preferably into the remaining non conserved sites.

The variations can be made using methods known in the art such as oligonucleotide mediated site directed mutagenesis alanine scanning and PCR mutagenesis. Site directed mutagenesis Carter et al. 13 4331 1986 Zoller et al. 10 6487 1987 cassette mutagenesis Wells et al. 34 315 1985 restriction selection mutagenesis Wells et al. 317 415 1986 or other known techniques can be performed on the cloned DNA to produce the anti BOC molecule.

Scanning amino acid analysis can also be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include alanine glycine serine and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side chain beyond the beta carbon and is less likely to alter the main chain conformation of the variant Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions Creighton The Proteins W.H. Freeman Co. N.Y. Chothia 150 1 1976 . If alanine substitution does not yield adequate amounts of variant an isoteric amino acid can be used.

Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the BOC and or CDO polypeptides also may be substituted generally with serine to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely cysteine bond s may be added to such a molecule to improve its stability particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment .

A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and target polypeptide. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of BOC and or CDO polypeptides are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of a native sequence or an earlier prepared variant.

In one embodiment such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the BOC and or CDO polypeptides E.g. BOC chimeric polypeptides CDO chimeric polypeptides respectively with a tag polypeptide which provides an epitope to which an anti tag antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino or carboxyl terminus of such antibody or polypeptide. The presence of such epitope tagged forms of such antibodies or polypeptides can be detected using an antibody against the tag polypeptide. Also provision of the epitope tag enables such antibodies or polypeptide to be readily purified by affinity purification using an anti tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that binds to the epitope tag. Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art. Examples include poly histidine poly his or poly histidine glycine poly his gly tags the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 Field et al. 8 2159 2165 1988 the c myc tag and the 8F9 3C7 6E10 G4 B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto Evan et al. 5 3610 3616 1985 and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D gD tag and its antibody Paborsky et al. 3 6 547 553 1990 . Other tag polypeptides include the Flag peptide Hopp et al. 6 1204 1210 1988 the KT3 epitope peptide Martin et al. 255 192 194 1992 an tubulin epitope peptide Skinner et al. 266 15163 15166 1991 and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag Lutz Freyermuth et al. 87 6393 6397 1990 .

In an alternative embodiment the chimeric molecule may comprise a fusion of the BOC and or CDO polypeptides with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin E.g. Fc domain . For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule also referred to as an immunoadhesin such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a soluble transmembrane domain deleted or inactivated form of a preceding antibody or polypeptide in the place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a particularly preferred embodiment the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge CHand CH or the hinge CH CHand CHregions of an IgG1 molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin fusions see also U.S. Pat. No. 5 428 130 issued Jun. 27 1995.

The description below relates primarily to production of BOC and or CDO polypeptides by culturing cells transformed or transfected with a vector containing nucleic acid such antibodies polypeptides and oligopeptides. For purposes of this section G. and the Examples only the term BOC polypeptides and CDO polypeptides shall include the respective BOC binding and CDO binding antibodies including BOC and CDO binding antibody fragments polypeptides including chimeric polypeptides and oligopeptides . It is of course contemplated that alternative methods which are well known in the art may be employed to prepare such antibodies polypeptides and oligopeptides. For instance the appropriate amino acid sequence or portions thereof may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid phase techniques see e.g. Stewart et al. W.H. Freeman Co. San Francisco Calif. 1969 Merrifield 85 2149 2154 1963 . In vitro protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be accomplished for instance using an Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer Foster City Calif. using the manufacturer s instructions. Various portions of such antibodies polypeptides or oligopeptides may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical or enzymatic methods to produce the desired product.

DNA encoding a BOC polypeptide and or CDO polypeptide may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue believed to possess such antibody polypeptide or oligopeptide mRNA and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly DNA encoding such polypeptides can be conveniently obtained from a cDNA library prepared from human tissue a genomic library or by known synthetic procedures e.g. automated nucleic acid synthesis .

Libraries can be screened with probes such as oligonucleotides of at least about 20 80 bases designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Screening the cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures such as described in Sambrook et al. New York Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989 . Alternatively PCR methodology may be used. Sambrook et al. supra Dieffenbach et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1995 .

Techniques for screening a cDNA library are well known in the art. The oligonucleotide sequences selected as probes should be of sufficient length and sufficiently unambiguous that false positives are minimized. The oligonucleotide is preferably labeled such that it can be detected upon hybridization to DNA in the library being screened. Methods of labeling are well known in the art and include the use of radiolabels like P labeled ATP biotinylation or enzyme labeling. Hybridization conditions including moderate stringency and high stringency are provided in Sambrook et al. supra.

Sequences identified in such library screening methods can be compared and aligned to other known sequences deposited and available in public databases such as GenBank or other private sequence databases. Sequence identity at either the amino acid or nucleotide level within defined regions of the molecule or across the full length sequence can be determined using methods known in the art and as described herein.

Nucleic acid having protein coding sequence may be obtained by screening selected cDNA or genomic libraries using the deduced amino acid sequence disclosed herein for the first time and if necessary using conventional primer extension procedures as described in Sambrook et al. supra to detect precursors and processing intermediates of mRNA that may not have been reverse transcribed into cDNA.

Host cells are transfected or transformed with expression or cloning vectors described herein for BOC and or CDO polypeptide production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. The culture conditions such as media temperature pH and the like can be selected by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. In general principles protocols and practical techniques for maximizing the productivity of cell cultures can be found in M. Butler ed. IRL Press 1991 and Sambrook et al. supra.

Methods of eukaryotic cell transfection and prokaryotic cell transformation are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan for example CaCl CaPO liposome mediated and electroporation. Depending on the host cell used transformation is performed using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride as described in Sambrook et al. supra or electroporation is generally used for prokaryotes. Infection with is used for transformation of certain plant cells as described by Shaw et al. 23 315 1983 and WO 89 05859 published 29 Jun. 1989. For mammalian cells without such cell walls the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb 52 456 457 1978 can be employed. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transfections have been described in U.S. Patent No. 4 399 216. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al. 130 946 1977 and Hsiao et al. . 76 3829 1979 . However other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as by nuclear microinjection electroporation bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells or polycations e.g. polybrene polyomithine may also be used. For various techniques for transforming mammalian cells see Keown et al. 185 527 537 1990 and Mansour et al. 336 348 352 1988 .

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include prokaryote yeast or higher eukaryote cells. Suitable prokaryotes include but are not limited to eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms for example Enterobacteriaceae such as . Various strains are publicly available such as K12 strain MM294 ATCC 31 446 X1776 ATCC 31 537 strain W3110 ATCC 27 325 and K5 772 ATCC 53 635 . Other suitable prokaryotic host cells include Enterobacteriaceae such as e.g. e.g. e.g. and as well as Bacilli such as and e.g. 41P disclosed in DD 266 710 published 12 Apr. 1989 such as and . These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Strain W3110 is one particularly preferred host or parent host because it is a common host strain for recombinant DNA product fermentations. Preferably the host cell secretes minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes. For example strain W3110 may be modified to effect a genetic mutation in the genes encoding proteins endogenous to the host with examples of such hosts including W3110 strain 1A2 which has the complete genotype tonA W3110 strain 9E4 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 W3110 strain 27C7 ATCC 55 244 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 argF lac 169 degp ompT kanW3110 strain 37D6 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 argF lac 169 degp ompT rbs7 ilvG kanW3110 strain 40B4 which is strain 37D6 with a non kanamycin resistant degP deletion mutation and an strain having mutant periplasmic protease disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4 946 783 issued 7 Aug. 1990. Alternatively in vitro methods of cloning e.g. PCR or other nucleic acid polymerase reactions are suitable.

Full length antibody antibody fragments and antibody fusion proteins can be produced in bacteria in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a toxin and the immunoconjugate by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full length antibodies have greater half life in circulation. Production in is faster and more cost efficient. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237 Carter et. al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 789 199 Joly et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 840 523 Simmons et al. which describes translation initiation region TIR and signal sequences for optimizing expression and secretion these patents incorporated herein by reference. After expression the antibody is isolated from the cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be purified through e.g. a protein A or G column depending on the isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody expressed in suitable cells e.g. CHO cells .

In addition to prokaryotes eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for vectors encoding BOC and or CDO polypeptides. is a commonly used lower eukaryotic host microorganism. Others include Beach and Nurse 290 140 1981 EP 139 383 published 2 May 1985 hosts U.S. Pat. No. 4 943 529 Fleer et al. 9 968 975 1991 such as e.g. MW98 8C CBS683 CBS4574 Louvencourt et al. 154 2 737 742 1983 ATCC 12 424 ATCC 16 045 ATCC 24 178 ATCC 56 500 ATCC 36 906 Van den Berg et al. 8 135 1990 and EP 402 226 EP 183 070 Sreekrishna et al. 28 265 278 1988 EP 244 234 Case et al. 76 5259 5263 1979 such as EP 394 538 published 31 Oct. 1990 and filamentous fungi such as e.g. WO 91 00357 published 10 Jan. 1991 and hosts such as Ballance et al. 112 284 289 1983 Tilburn et al. 26 205 221 1983 Yelton et al. 81 1470 1474 1984 and Kelly and Hynes 4 475 479 1985 . Methylotropic yeasts are suitable herein and include but are not limited to yeast capable of growth on methanol selected from the genera consisting of and . A list of specific species that are exemplary of this class of yeasts may be found in C. Anthony 269 1982 .

Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated BOC and or CDO polypeptide production are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 as well as plant cells such as cell cultures of cotton corn potato soybean petunia tomato and tobacco. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as caterpillar mosquito mosquito fruitfly and have been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available e.g. the L 1 variant of NPV and the Bm 5 strain of NPV and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention particularly for transfection of cells.

However interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK ATCC CCL 10 Chinese hamster ovary cells DHFR CHO Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 ATCC CCL 70 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 ATCC CRL 1587 human cervical carcinoma cells HELA ATCC CCL 2 canine kidney cells MDCK ATCC CCL 34 buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A ATCC CRL 1442 human lung cells W138 ATCC CCL 75 human liver cells Hep G2 HB 8065 mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 ATCC CCL51 TRI cells Mather et al. 383 44 68 1982 MRC 5 cells FS4 cells and a human hepatoma line Hep G2 .

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for BOC and or CDO polypeptide production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The nucleic acid e.g. cDNA or genomic DNA encoding the respective BOC and or CDO polypeptide may be inserted into a replicable vector for cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may for example be in the form of a plasmid cosmid viral particle or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site s using techniques known in the art. Vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence. Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are known to the skilled artisan.

The BOC and or CDO polypeptide may be produced recombinantly not only directly but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide which may be a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the DNA encoding the mature sequence that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence may be a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase lpp or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequence may be e.g. the yeast invertase leader alpha factor leader including and factor leaders the latter described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 010 182 or acid phosphatase leader the glucoamylase leader EP 362 179 published 4 Apr. 1990 or the signal described in WO 90 13646 published 15 Nov. 1990. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences may be used to direct secretion of the protein such as signal sequences from secreted polypeptides of the same or related species as well as viral secretory leaders.

Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria yeast and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram negative bacteria the 2 plasmid origin is suitable for yeast and various viral origins SV40 polyoma adenovirus VSV or BPV are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells.

Expression and cloning vectors will typically contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media e.g. the gene encoding D alanine racemase for Bacilli.

An example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up nucleic acid encoding the desire protein such as DHFR or thymidine kinase. An appropriate host cell when wild type DHFR is employed is the CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 . A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 Stinchcomb et al. 282 39 1979 Kingsman et al. 7 141 1979 Tschemper et al. 10 157 1980 . The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4 1 Jones 85 12 1977 .

Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the desired amino acid sequence in order to direct mRNA synthesis. Promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the lactamase and lactose promoter systems Chang et al. 275 615 1978 Goeddel et al. 281 544 1979 alkaline phosphatase a tryptophan trp promoter system Goeddel 8 4057 1980 EP 36 776 and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter deBoer et al. 80 21 25 1983 . Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine Dalgarno S.D. sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the desired protein sequence.

Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase Hitzeman et al. 255 2073 1980 or other glycolytic enzymes Hess et al. 7 149 1968 Holland 17 4900 1978 such as enolase glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase hexokinase pyruvate decarboxylase phosphofructokinase glucose 6 phosphate isomerase 3 phosphoglycerate mutase pyruvate kinase triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucose isomerase and glucokinase.

Other yeast promoters which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2 isocytochrome C acid phosphatase degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism metallothionein glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73 657.

DNA Transcription in mammalian host cells is controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus UK 2 211 504 published 5 Jul. 1989 adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter and from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

Transcription of a DNA encoding the BOC polypeptide and or CDO polypeptide may be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis acting elements of DNA usually about from 10 to 300 bp that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the coding sequence of the preceding amino acid sequences but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells yeast fungi insect plant animal human or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding the respective antibody polypeptide or oligopeptide described in this section.

Still other methods vectors and host cells suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of the respective antibody polypeptide or oligopeptide in recombinant vertebrate cell culture are described in Gething et al. 293 620 625 1981 Mantei et al. 281 40 46 1979 EP 117 060 and EP 117 058.

The host cells used to produce the BOC and or CDO polypeptides may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Patent Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

Gene amplification and or expression may be measured in a sample directly for example by conventional Southern blotting Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA Thomas 77 5201 5205 1980 dot blotting DNA analysis or in situ hybridization using an appropriately labeled probe based on the sequences provided herein. Alternatively antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes including DNA duplexes RNA duplexes and DNA RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn may be labeled and the assay may be carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface so that upon the formation of duplex on the surface the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected.

Gene expression alternatively may be measured by immunological methods such as immunohistochemical staining of cells or tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids to quantitate directly the expression of gene product. Antibodies useful for immunohistochemical staining and or assay of sample fluids may be either monoclonal or polyclonal and may be prepared in any mammal. Conveniently the antibodies suitable for the present method may be prepared against a native sequence polypeptide or oligopeptide or against exogenous sequence fused to DNA and encoding a specific antibody epitope of such a polypeptide or oligopeptide.

BOC and or CDO polypeptides may be recovered from culture medium or from host cell lysates. If membrane bound it can be released from the membrane using a suitable detergent solution e.g. Triton X 100 or by enzymatic cleavage. Cells employed in expression of the preceding can be disrupted by various physical or chemical means such as freeze thaw cycling sonication mechanical disruption or cell lysing agents.

It may be desireable to purify the preceding from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures by fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE chromatofocusing SDS PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation gel filtration using for example Sephadex G 75 protein A Sepharose columns to remove contaminants such as IgG and metal chelating columns to bind epitope tagged forms of the desired molecules. Various methods of protein purification may be employed and such methods are known in the art and described for example in Deutscher 182 1990 Scopes Springer Verlag New York 1982 . The purification step s selected will depend for example on the nature of the production process used and the particular antibody polypeptide or oligopeptide produced for the claimed methods.

When using recombinant techniques the BOC and or CDO polypeptide can be produced intracellularly in the periplasmic space or directly secreted into the medium. If such molecules are produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of . Briefly cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate pH 3.5 EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride PMSF over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

Purification can occur using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25M salt .

Therapeutic formulations of the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists therapeutic agent used in accordance with the present invention may be prepared for storage by mixing the therapeutic agent s having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 20th edition Gennaro A. et al. Ed. Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science 2000 in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as acetate Tris phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA tonicifiers such as trehalose and sodium chloride sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol surfactant such as polysorbate salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG . The antibody preferably comprises the antibody at a concentration of between 5 200 mg ml preferably between 10 100 mg ml.

The formulations of therapeutic agents described herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example in addition to the preceding therapeutic agent s it may be desirable to include in the formulation an additional antibody e.g. a second such therapeutic agent or an antibody to some other target such as a growth factor that affects the growth of the glioma. Alternatively or additionally the composition may further comprise a chemotherapeutic agent cytotoxic agent cytokine growth inhibitory agent anti hormonal agent and or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in supra.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semi permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid.

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

To determine BOC and or CDO expression in tumor or cancer various diagnostic assays are available. In one embodiment hedgehog and or CDO polypeptide overexpression and or BOC polypeptide underexpression may be analyzed by immunohistochemistry IHC . Parrafin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a hedgehog BOC and or CDO protein staining intensity criteria as follows 

Score 1 a faint barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10 of the tumor cells. The cells are only stained in part of their membrane.

Score 2 a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Score 3 a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Those tumors with 0 or 1 scores for hedgehog BOC or CDO polypeptide expression may be characterized as underexpressing or not overexpressing hedgehog BOC or CDO respectively whereas those tumors with 2 or 3 scores may be characterized as overexpressing hedgehog BOC or CDO respectively.

Alternatively or additionally FISH assays such as the INFORM sold by Ventana Ariz. or PATHVISION Vysis Ill. may be carried out on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue to determine the extent if any of hedgehog or CDO overexpression and or BOC underexpression in the tumor.

Hedgehog BOC or CDO overexpression or amplification may be evaluated using an in vivo diagnostic assay e.g. by administering a molecule such as an antibody oligopeptide or organic molecule which binds the molecule to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope or a fluorescent label and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label.

Currently depending on the stage of the cancer cancer treatment involves one or a combination of the following therapies surgery to remove the cancerous tissue radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Therapy comprising of administering BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists may be especially desirable in elderly patients who do not tolerate the toxicity and side effects of chemotherapy well and in metastatic disease where radiation therapy has limited usefulness. The tumor targeting BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists of the present inventive method may also be used to alleviate hedgehog and or CDO overexpressing and or BOC underexpressing cancers upon initial diagnosis of the disease or during relapse. For therapeutic applications such BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists can be used in combination with before or after application of other conventional agents and or methods for the treatment of glioma e.g. hormones antiangiogens or radiolabelled compounds or with surgery cryotherapy radiotherapy and or chemotherapy. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as TAXOTERE docetaxel TAXOL palictaxel estramustine and mitoxantrone are used in treating cancer in particular in good risk patients.

In particular combination therapy with palictaxel and modified derivatives see e.g. EP0600517 is contemplated. The preceding BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist will be administered with a therapeutically effective dose of the chemotherapeutic agent. In another embodiment such antibody polypeptide oligopeptide or organic molecule is administered in conjunction with chemotherapy to enhance the activity and efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent e.g. paclitaxel. The Physicians Desk Reference PDR discloses dosages of these agents that have been used in treatment of various cancers. The dosing regimen and dosages of these aforementioned chemotherapeutic drugs that are therapeutically effective will depend on the particular cancer being treated the extent of the disease and other factors familiar to the physician of skill in the art and can be determined by the physician.

In one particular embodiment an immunoconjugate comprising such a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist conjugated with a cytotoxic agent is administered to the patient. Preferably such immunoconjugate is internalized by the cell resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the cancer cell to which it binds. In a preferred embodiment the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with the nucleic acid in the cancer cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents are described above and include maytansinoids calicheamicins ribonucleases and DNA endonucleases.

The preceding BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists or toxin conjugates thereof are administered to a human patient in accord with known methods such as intravenous administration e.g. as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time by intracranial intracerobrospinal intra articular intrathecal intravenous intraarterial subcutaneous oral topical or inhalation routes.

Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of the foregoing BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists. The combined administration includes co administration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. Preferably such combined therapy results in a synergistic therapeutic effect.

In another embodiment the therapeutic treatment methods of the present invention involves the combined administration of the preceding BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents including co administration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents. Example chemotherapeutic agents have been provided previously. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed. M. C. Perry Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1992 .

For the prevention or treatment of disease the dosage and mode of administration will be chosen by the physician according to known criteria. The appropriate dosage of BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists will depend on the type of disease to be treated the severity and course of the disease whether administration is for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy including the patient s clinical history and response and the discretion of the attending physician. The preceding BOC CDO hedgehog antagonists may be suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Administration may occur by intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injections. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to about 50 mg kg body weight e.g. about 0.1 15 mg kg dose of BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A dosing regimen can comprise administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of such a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist. However other dosage regimens may be useful. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. The progress of this therapy can be readily monitored by conventional methods and assays and based on criteria known to the physician or other persons of skill in the art.

Aside from administration of the antibody protein to the patient the present application contemplates administration of the antibody by gene therapy. Such administration of nucleic acid encoding the BOC CDO hedgehog polypeptide antagonists is encompassed by the expression administering a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody . See for example WO96 07321 published Mar. 14 1996 concerning the use of gene therapy to generate intracellular antibodies.

There are two major approaches to getting such nucleic acid optionally contained in a vector into the patient s cells in vivo and ex vivo. For in vivo delivery the nucleic acid is injected directly into the patient usually at the site where the antibody is required. For ex vivo treatment the patient s cells are removed the nucleic acid is introduced into these isolated cells and the modified cells are administered to the patient either directly or for example encapsulated within porous membranes which are implanted into the patient see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 892 538 and 5 283 187 . There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes electroporation microinjection cell fusion DEAE dextran the calcium phosphate precipitation method etc. A commonly used vector for ex vivo delivery of the gene is a retroviral vector.

The currently preferred in vivo nucleic acid transfer techniques include transfection with viral vectors such as adenovirus Herpes simplex I virus or adeno associated virus and lipid based systems useful lipids for lipid mediated transfer of the gene are DOTMA DOPE and DC Chol for example . For review of the currently known gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. 256 808 813 1992 . See also WO 93 25673 and the references cited therein.

For therapeutic applications the article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container indicating a use for the inhibition in whole or in part of hedgehog signaling or alternatively for the treatment of a disorder or condition resulting from activation of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Suitable containers include for example bottles vials syringes etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is effective for treating the cancer condition and may have a sterile access port for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle . At least one active agent in the composition is a BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating glioma. The label or package insert will further comprise instructions for administering the BOC CDO hedgehog antagonist. Additionally the article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer such as bacteriostatic water for injection BWFI phosphate buffered saline Ringer s solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint including other buffers diluents filters needles and syringes.

Kits may also be provided that are useful for various other purposes e.g. for BOC expressing and or CDO expressing cell killing assays for purification or immunoprecipitation of BOC and or CDO polypeptide from cells. For isolation and purification of BOC and or CDO polypeptide the kit can contain the respective BOC and or CDO binding reagent coupled to beads e.g. sepharose beads . Kits can be provided which contain such molecules for detection and quantitation of BOC and or CDO polypeptide in vitro e.g. in an ELISA or a Western blot. As with the article of manufacture the kit comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. The container holds a composition comprising at least one such BOC and or CDO binding reagent useable with the invention. Additional containers may be included that contain e.g. diluents and buffers control antibodies. The label or package insert may provide a description of the composition as well as instructions for the intended in vitro or diagnostic use.

Molecules that would be expected 1 to inhibit BOC and therefor activate or amplify hedgehog signaling as well as 2 to inhibit CDO and therefor inhibit or antagonize hedgehog signaling include fragments of the respective BOC or CDO encoding nucleic acids such as antisense or sense oligonucleotides BOC sense antisense NA and CDO sense antisense NA respectively . Such nucleic acids comprise a single stranded nucleic acid sequence either RNA or DNA capable of binding to the respective target a BOC or CDO mRNA sense or b BOC or CDO DNA antisense sequences. BOC sense antisense NA and CDO sense antisense NA comprise a fragment of the coding region of the respective BOC or CDO RNA or DNA. The ability to derive an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide based upon a cDNA sequence encoding a given protein is described in for example Stein and Cohen 48 2659 1988 and van der Krol et al. 6 958 1988 .

Binding of antisense or sense oligonucleotides to target nucleic acid sequences results in the formation of duplexes that block transcription or translation of the target sequence by one of several means including enhanced degradation of the duplexes premature termination of transcription or translation or by other means. Such methods are encompassed by the present invention. The BOC sense antisense NA and or CDO sense antisense NA thus may be used to block the respective expression of 1 BOC polypeptides wherein those BOC polypeptides may play a role in the inhibition or attenuation of hedgehog signaling and or 2 CDO polypeptides wherein those CDO polypeptides may play a role in the activation or amplification of hedgehog signaling. Such BOC sense antisense NA and or CDO sense antisense NA may further comprise oligonucleotides having modified sugar phosphodiester backbones or other sugar linkages such as those described in WO 91 06629 and wherein such sugar linkages are resistant to endogenous nucleases. Nucleic acid with such resistant sugar linkages are stable in vivo i.e. capable of resisting enzymatic degradation but retain sequence specificity to be able to bind to target nucleotide sequences.

The BOC sense antisense NA and or CDO sense antisense NA used in accordance with this invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well known technique of solid phase synthesis. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including for example Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. . Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. It is well known to use similar techniques to prepare oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.

Other examples of BOC sense antisense NA and or CDO sense antisense NA suitable for use in the present invention include those oligonucleotides which are covalently linked to organic moieties such as those described in WO 90 10048 and other moieties that increases the affinity of the oligonucleotide for a target nucleic acid sequence such as poly L lysine . Further still intercalating agents such as ellipticine and alkylating agents or metal complexes may be attached to sense or antisense oligonucleotides to modify binding specificities of the antisense or sense oligonucleotide for the target nucleotide sequence.

Antisense or sense oligonucleotides suitable for use in the present invention may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by any gene transfer method including for example CaPO mediated DNA transfection electroporation or by using gene transfer vectors such as Epstein Barr virus. In a preferred procedure an antisense or sense oligonucleotide is inserted into a suitable retroviral vector. A cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence is contacted with the recombinant retroviral vector either in vivo or ex vivo. Suitable retroviral vectors include but are not limited to those derived from the murine retrovirus M MuLV N2 a retrovirus derived from M MuLV or the double copy vectors designated DCT5A DCT5B and DCT5C see WO 90 13641 .

Alternatively such sense or antisense oligonucleotides also may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleotide sequence by formation of a conjugate with a ligand binding molecule as described in WO 91 04753. Suitable ligand binding molecules include but are not limited to cell surface receptors growth factors other cytokines or other ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. Preferably conjugation of the ligand binding molecule does not substantially interfere with the ability of the ligand binding molecule to bind to its corresponding molecule or receptor or block entry of the sense or antisense oligonucleotide or its conjugated version into the cell.

Alternatively a sense or an antisense oligonucleotide may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by formation of an oligonucleotide lipid complex as described in WO 90 10448. The sense or antisense oligonucleotide lipid complex is preferably dissociated within the cell by an endogenous lipase.

Antisense or sense RNA or DNA molecules are generally at least about 5 nucleotides in length alternatively at least about 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430 440 450 460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550 560 570 580 590 600 610 620 630 640 650 660 670 680 690 700 710 720 730 740 750 760 770 780 790 800 810 820 830 840 850 860 870 880 890 900 910 920 930 940 950 960 970 980 990 or 1000 nucleotides in length wherein in this context the term about means the referenced nucleotide sequence length plus or minus 10 of that referenced length.

The assays can be performed in a variety of formats including protein protein binding assays biochemical screening assays immunoassays and cell based assays which are well characterized in the art.

All antagonist style assays share the common feature of contacting the drug candidate target molecule against a BOC polypeptide to screen for hedgehog agonists or with a hedgehog or CDO polypeptide to screen for hedgehog antagonists under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow these two components to interact.

In binding assays the interaction is binding and the complex formed can be isolated or detected in the reaction mixture. In a particular embodiment the target molecule encoded by the gene identified herein or the drug candidate is immobilized on a solid phase e.g. on a microtiter plate by covalent or non covalent attachments. Non covalent attachment generally is accomplished by coating the solid surface with a solution of the target molecule and drying. Alternatively an immobilized antibody e.g. a monoclonal antibody specific for the target molecule to be immobilized can be used to anchor it to a solid surface. The assay is performed by adding the non immobilized component which may be labeled by a detectable label to the immobilized component e.g. the coated surface containing the anchored component. When the reaction is complete the non reacted components are removed e.g. by washing and complexes anchored on the solid surface are detected. When the originally non immobilized component carries a detectable label the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexing occurred. Where the originally non immobilized component does not carry a label complexing can be detected for example by using a labeled antibody specifically binding the immobilized complex.

If the candidate compound interacts with but does not bind to a particular target molecule encoded by a gene identified herein its interaction with that polypeptide can be assayed by methods well known for detecting protein protein interactions. Such assays include traditional approaches such as e.g. cross linking co immunoprecipitation and co purification through gradients or chromatographic columns. In addition protein protein interactions can be monitored by using a yeast based genetic system described by Fields and co workers Fields and Song 340 245 246 1989 Chien et al. 88 9578 9582 1991 as disclosed by Chevray and Nathans 89 5789 5793 1991 . Many transcriptional activators such as yeast GAL4 consist of two physically discrete modular domains one acting as the DNA binding domain the other one functioning as the transcription activation domain. The yeast expression system described in the foregoing publications generally referred to as the two hybrid system takes advantage of this property and employs two hybrid proteins one in which the target protein is fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and another in which candidate activating proteins are fused to the activation domain. The expression of a GAL1 lacZ reporter gene under control of a GAL4 activated promoter depends on reconstitution of GAL4 activity via protein protein interaction. Colonies containing interacting polypeptides are detected with a chromogenic substrate for galactosidase. A complete kit MATCHMAKER for identifying protein protein interactions between two specific proteins using the two hybrid technique is commercially available from Clontech. This system can also be extended to map protein domains involved in specific protein interactions as well as to pinpoint amino acid residues that are crucial for these interactions.

Compounds that interfere with the interaction of a gene encoding a target molecule identified herein and other intra or extracellular components can be tested as follows usually a reaction mixture is prepared containing the product of the gene and the intra or extracellular component under conditions and for a time allowing for the interaction and binding of the two products. To test the ability of a candidate compound to inhibit binding the reaction is run in the absence and in the presence of the test compound. In addition a placebo may be added to a third reaction mixture to serve as positive control. The binding complex formation between the test compound and the intra or extracellular component present in the mixture is monitored as described hereinabove. The formation of a complex in the control reaction s but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound indicates that the test compound interferes with the interaction of the test compound and its reaction partner.

To assay for suitable drug candidates the target molecule may be added to a cell along with the compound to be screened for a particular activity e.g hedgehog signaling activation or inhibition and the ability of the compound to inhibit the activity of interest in the presence of the target molecule indicates that the test compound is an antagonist to the target molecule. Alternatively antagonists may be detected by combining the target molecule and a potential antagonist with membrane bound target molecule or recombinant receptors under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. The target molecule can be labeled such as by radioactivity such that the number of target molecules bound to the receptor can be used to determine the effectiveness of the potential antagonist. The gene encoding the receptor can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art for example ligand panning and FACS sorting. Coligan et al. 1 2 Chapter 5 1991 . Preferably expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the target molecule and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to the target molecule. Transfected cells that are grown on glass slides are exposed to labeled target molecule. The target molecule can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion of a recognition site for a site specific protein kinase. Following fixation and incubation the slides are subjected to autoradiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub pools are prepared and re transfected using an interactive sub pooling and re screening process eventually yielding a single clone that encodes the putative receptor.

As an alternative approach for receptor identification labeled target molecule can be photoaffinity linked with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross linked material is resolved by PAGE and exposed to X ray film. The labeled complex containing the receptor can be excised resolved into peptide fragments and subjected to protein micro sequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from micro sequencing would be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the gene encoding the putative receptor.

In another assay for antagonists mammalian cells or a membrane preparation expressing the receptor would be incubated with labeled target molecule in the presence of the candidate compound. The ability of the compound to enhance or block this interaction could then be measured.

More specific examples of potential antagonists include an oligonucleotide that binds to the fusions of immunoglobulin with target molecule and in particular antibodies including without limitation poly and monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments single chain antibodies anti idiotypic antibodies and chimeric or humanized versions of such antibodies or fragments as well as human antibodies and antibody fragments. Alternatively a potential antagonist may be a closely related protein for example a mutated form of the target molecule that recognizes the receptor but imparts no effect thereby competitively inhibiting the action of the target molecule.

Another potential BOC antagonist i.e. hedgehog agonist or CDO antagonist i.e. hedgehog antagonist is an antisense RNA or DNA construct prepared using antisense technology where e.g. an antisense RNA or DNA molecule acts to block directly the translation of mRNA by hybridizing to targeted mRNA and preventing protein translation.

Additional potential BOC antagonists i.e. hedgehog agonists and CDO antagonists i.e. hedgehog antagonists include small molecules that bind to the active site the receptor binding site or growth factor or other relevant binding site of the respective BOC or CDO polypeptide thereby blocking its normal biological activity. Examples of small molecules include but are not limited to small peptides or peptide like molecules preferably soluble peptides and synthetic non peptidyl organic or inorganic compounds.

Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. Ribozymes act by sequence specific hybridization to the complementary target RNA followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within a potential RNA target can be identified by known techniques. For further details see e.g. Rossi 4 469 471 1994 and PCT publication No. WO 97 33551 published Sep. 18 1997 .

Nucleic acid molecules in triple helix formation used to inhibit transcription should be single stranded and composed of deoxynucleotides. The base composition of these oligonucleotides is designed such that it promotes triple helix formation via Hoogsteen base pairing rules which generally require sizeable stretches of purines or pyrimidines on one strand of a duplex. For further details see e.g. PCT publication No. WO 97 33551 supra.

These small molecules can be identified by any one or more of the screening assays discussed hereinabove and or by any other screening techniques well known for those skilled in the art.

The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way.

All patent and literature references cited in the present specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

An RNA coding region is a nucleic acid that can serve as a template for the synthesis of an RNA molecule such as a double stranded RNA complex. Preferably the RNA coding region is a DNA sequence.

The RNA coding region preferably encodes a double stranded RNA complex e.g. siRNA miRNA shRNA that is capable of down regulating the expression of a particular gene or genes. In some embodiments a double stranded RNA complex is expressed in the form of an RNA molecule having a stem loop or a so called hairpin structure. As used herein hairpin structure encompasses shRNAs and miRNAs. In some embodiments a double stranded RNA complex is expressed in the form of separate complementary or partially complementary RNA strands.

Methods are well known in the art for designing double stranded RNA complexes eg siRNA miRNA and shRNAs. For example resources and citations describing the design of effective shRNA and siRNA are found in Sandy et al 39 215 224 2005 . It is understood that the sequences of a double stranded RNA complex may be of natural origin or may be synthetic. For example Example 13 discloses a hybrid miRNA comprising a synthetic double stranded portion embedded in the backbone of a naturally occurring microRNA.

The RNA complex comprises a double stranded region corresponding to a region of a gene to be down regulated is expressed in the cell. One strand of the RNA double stranded region is substantially identical typically at least about 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 identical in sequence to the sequence of the coding region targeted for down regulation. The other strand of the double stranded region interchangeably termed RNA double stranded region is complementary to the sequence of the coding region targeted for down regulation or partially complementary to the coding region targeted for down regulation typically at least about 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 identical to the complement of the coding region targeted . It is understood that the double stranded region can be formed by two separate RNA stranded or by the self complementary portions of a single RNA having a hairpin structure. The double stranded region is generally at least about 15 nucleotides in length and in some embodiments is about 15 to about 30 nucleotides in length. However a significantly longer double stranded region can be used effectively in some organisms. In a more preferred embodiment the double stranded region is between about 19 and 22 nucleotides in length. The double stranded region is preferably identical to the target nucleotide sequence over this region.

When the coding region to be down regulated is in a family of highly conserved genes the sequence of the RNA double stranded region can be chosen with the aid of sequence comparison to target only the desired gene. On the other hand if there is sufficient identity among a family of homologous genes within an organism a double stranded can be designed that would down regulate a plurality of genes simultaneously.

In some embodiments a single RNA coding region in the construct serves as a template for the expression of a self complementary hairpin RNA comprising a sense region a loop region and an antisense region. The sense and antisense regions are each preferably about 15 to about 30 nucleotides in length. The loop region preferably is about 2 to about 15 nucleotides in length more preferably from about 4 to about 9 nucleotides in length. Following expression the sense and antisense regions form a duplex.

In another embodiment the vector comprises two RNA coding regions. The first coding region is a template for the expression of a first RNA and the second coding region is a template for the expression of a second RNA. Following expression the first and second RNAs form a duplex. The retroviral construct preferably also comprises a first Pol III promoter operably linked to the first RNA coding region and a second Pol III promoter operably linked to the second RNA coding region.

It is understood that in certain embodiments a vector of the invention can encompass nucleic acid sequences sufficient to form more than RNA coding region that inhibit expression of distinct target genes. In this embodiment simultaneous inhibition of distinct target genes can be accomplished with a single vector of the invention. The number of different RNA complex transcripts that can be expressed simultaneously is limited only by the packaging capacity of the vector if a viral vector is used and adjacent promoters including any of the promoters described below can be selected to eliminate or minimize interference and allow for efficient simultaneous inhibition of multiple target genes. The inhibition of multiple RNA construct transcripts of adjacent promoters for example 2 or more 3 or more 4 or more 5 or more 6 or more 7 or more 8 or more 9 or more or 10 or more adjacent promoters allows the user to generate a desire phenotype that develops only when several coding regions eg genes are targeted simultaneously and enables manipulation and elucidation of complex genetic systems.

Commercially available reagents referred to in the examples were used according to manufacturer s instructions unless otherwise indicated. The source of those cells identified in the following examples and throughout the specification by ATCC accession numbers is the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va.

The extracellular domain ECD sequences including the secretion signal sequence if any from about 950 known secreted proteins from the Swiss Prot public database were used to search EST databases. The EST databases included public EST databases e.g. GenBank . The search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST2 Altschul et al. 266 460 480 1996 as a comparison of the ECD protein sequences to a 6 frame translation of the EST sequences. Those comparisons resulting in a BLAST score of 70 or in some cases 90 or greater that did not encode known proteins were clustered and assembled into consensus DNA sequences with the program phrap Phil Green University of Washington Seattle Wash. .

This method allowed the identification of a single Merck Washington University EST sequence EST no. AA339802 from which oligonucleotides were synthesized 1 to identify by PCR a cDNA library that contained the sequence of interest and 2 for use as probes to isolate a clone of the full length coding sequence for PRO1190. Forward and reverse PCR primers generally range from 20 to 30 nucleotides and are often designed to give a PCR product of about 100 1000 bp in length. The probe sequences are typically 40 55 bp in length. In some cases additional oligonucleotides are synthesized when the consensus sequence is greater than about 1 1.5 kbp. In order to screen several libraries for a full length clone DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification as per Ausubel et al. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology supra with the PCR primer pair. A positive library was then used to isolate clones encoding the gene of interest using the probe oligonucleotide and one of the primer pairs.

Additionally a synthetic oligonucleotide hybridization probe was constructed from the DNA53943 sequence which had the following nucleotide sequence 

In order to screen several libraries for a source of a full length clone DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification with the PCR primer pair identified above. A positive library was then used to isolate clones encoding the PRO1190 gene using the probe oligonucleotide and one of the PCR primers.

RNA for construction of the cDNA libraries was isolated from human bone marrow.

The cDNA was primed with oligo dT containing a NotI site linked with blunt to SalI hemikinased adaptors cleaved with NotI sized appropriately by gel electrophoresis and cloned in a defined orientation into a suitable cloning vector such as pRKB or pRKD pRK5B is a precursor of pRK5D that does not contain the SfiI site see Holmes et al. 253 1278 1280 1991 in the unique XhoI and NotI sites.

DNA sequencing of the clones isolated as described above gave the full length DNA sequence for PRO1190 designated herein as DNA59586 SEQ ID NO 3 and the derived protein sequence for PRO190.

The entire coding sequence of PRO1190 is shown in SEQ ID NO 3 . Clone DNA59586 contains a single open reading frame with an apparent translational initiation site at nucleotide positions 340 342 and an apparent stop codon at nucleotide positions 3685 3687. The predicted polypeptide precursor is 1115 amino acids long. The full length PRO1190 protein shown in has an estimated molecular weight of about 121 188 Daltons and a pI of about 7.07. Other features of the PRO1190 protein include two transmembrane domains at amino acids 16 30 and 854 879 a cytochrome P450 cysteine heme iron ligand signature at amino acids 1051 1060 an N 6 adenine specific DNA methylases signature at amino acids 1045 1051 and potential N glycosylation sites at amino acids 65 68 76 79 98 101 189 192 275 278 518 521 726 729 and 760 763. Clone DNA59586 UNQ604 designated as DNA59586 1520 was deposited with the ATCC on Sep. 29 1998 and is assigned ATCC deposit no. 203288.

The clone DNA227967 UNQ9067 may be isolated in a manner similar to that described above for DNA59586. Alternatively similar CDO related sequences are publicly available under accession number NM016952. The predicted polypeptide is 1240 amino acids in length. The full length PRO38430 show in has an estimated molecular weight of about 134 024 Daltons and a pI of about 6.38. Other features of the PRO38430 protein includes a transmembrane domain at about residues 941 961 Immunoglobulin domains at about residues 19 75 212 268 302 358 395 478 Fibronectin type III domains at about residues 553 643 697 783 799 892 Immuno Tyrosine Inhibition Motif at about residues 972 992.

Nucleic acid microarrays often containing thousands of gene sequences are useful for identifying differentially expressed genes in diseased tissues as compared to their normal counterparts. Using nucleic acid microarrays test and control mRNA samples from test and control tissue samples are reverse transcribed and labeled to generate cDNA probes. The cDNA probes are then hybridized to an array of nucleic acids immobilized on a solid support. The array is configured such that the sequence and position of each member of the array is known. For example a selection of genes known to be expressed in certain disease states may be arrayed on a solid support. Hybridization of a labeled probe with a particular array member indicates that the sample from which the probe was derived expresses that gene. If the hybridization signal of a probe from a test disease tissue sample is greater than hybridization signal of a probe from a control normal tissue sample the gene or genes overexpressed in the disease tissue are identified. The implication of this result is that an overexpressed protein in a diseased tissue is useful not only as a diagnostic marker for the presence of the disease condition but also as a therapeutic target for treatment of the disease condition.

The methodology of hybridization of nucleic acids and microarray technology is well known in the art. In the present example the specific preparation of nucleic acids for hybridization and probes slides and hybridization conditions are all detailed in PCT Patent Application Serial No. PCT US01 10482 filed on Mar. 30 2001 and which is herein incorporated by reference.

In this assay a 5 nuclease assay for example TaqMan and real time quantitative PCR for example ABI Prizm 7700 Sequence Detection System Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems Division Foster City Calif. is used to find genes that are significantly overexpressed in a cancerous glioma tumor or tumors as compared to other cancerous tumors or normal non cancerous tissue. The 5 nuclease assay reaction is a fluorescent PCR based technique which makes use of the 5 exonuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase enzyme to monitor gene expression in real time. Two oligonucleotide primers whose sequences are based upon the gene or EST sequence of interest are used to generate an amplicon typical of a PCR reaction. A third oligonucleotide or probe is designed to detect nucleotide sequence located between the two PCR primers. The probe is non extendible by Taq DNA polymerase enzyme and is labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye and a quencher fluorescent dye. Any laser induced emission from the reporter dye is quenched by the quenching dye when the two dyes are located close together as they are on the probe. During the PCR amplification reaction the Taq DNA polymerase enzyme cleaves the probe in a template dependent manner. The resultant probe fragments disassociate in solution and signal from the released reporter dye is free from the quenching effect of the second fluorophore. One molecule of reporter dye is liberated for each new molecule synthesized and detection of the unquenched reporter dye provides the basis for quantitative and quantitative interpretation of the data. This assay is well known and routinely used in the art to quantitatively identify gene expression differences between two different human tissue samples see e.g. Higuchi et al. 10 413 417 1992 Livak et al. 4 357 362 1995 Heid et al. 6 986 994 1996 Pennica et al. 95 25 14717 14722 1998 Pitti et al. 396 6712 699 703 1998 and Bieche et al. 78 661 666 1998 .

The 5 nuclease procedure is run on a real time quantitative PCR device such as the ABI Prism 7700TM Sequence Detection. The system consists of a thermocycler laser charge coupled device CCD camera and computer. The system amplifies samples in a 96 well format on a thermocycler. During amplification laser induced fluorescent signal is collected in real time through fiber optics cables for all 96 wells and detected at the CCD. The system includes software for running the instrument and for analyzing the data.

The starting material for the screen is mRNA isolated from a variety of different cancerous tissues. The mRNA is quantitated precisely e.g. fluorometrically. As a negative control RNA is isolated from various normal tissues of the same tissue type as the cancerous tissues being tested. Frequently tumor sample s are directly compared to matched normal sample s of the same tissue type meaning that the tumor and normal sample s are obtained from the same individual.

5 nuclease assay data are initially expressed as Ct or the threshold cycle. This is defined as the cycle at which the reporter signal accumulates above the background level of fluorescence. The Ct values are used as quantitative measurement of the relative number of starting copies of a particular target sequence in a nucleic acid sample when comparing cancer mRNA results to normal human mRNA results. As one Ct unit corresponds to 1 PCR cycle or approximately a 2 fold relative increase relative to normal two units corresponds to a 4 fold relative increase 3 units corresponds to an 8 fold relative increase and so on one can quantitatively and quantitatively measure the relative fold increase in mRNA expression between two or more different tissues. In this regard it is well accepted in the art that this assay is sufficiently technically sensitive to reproducibly detect an at least 2 fold increase in mRNA expression in a human tumor sample relative to a normal control.

In situ hybridization is a powerful and versatile technique for the detection and localization of nucleic acid sequences within cell or tissue preparations. It may be useful for example to identify sites of gene expression analyze the tissue distribution of transcription identify and localize viral infection follow changes in specific mRNA synthesis and aid in chromosome mapping.

In situ hybridization is performed following an optimized version of the protocol by Lu and Gillett 1 169 176 1994 using PCR generated P labeled riboprobes. Briefly formalin fixed paraffin embedded human tissues are sectioned deparaffinized deproteinated in proteinase K 20 g ml for 15 minutes at 37 C. and further processed for in situ hybridization as described by Lu and Gillett supra.

Techniques for producing monoclonal antibodies are known in the art and are described for instance in Goding supra. Immunogens that may be employed include purified BOC and or CDO polypeptides fusion proteins containing BOC and or CDO polypeptides and cells expressing recombinant BOC and or CDO polypeptides on the cell surface. Selection of the immunogen can be made by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation.

Mice such as Balb c are immunized with the above immunogen emulsified in complete Freund s adjuvant and injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally in an amount from 1 100 micrograms. Alternatively the immunogen is emulsified in MPL TDM adjuvant Ribi Immunochemical Research Hamilton Mont. and injected into the animal s hind foot pads. The immunized mice are then boosted 10 to 12 days later with additional immunogen emulsified in the selected adjuvant. Thereafter for several weeks the mice may also be boosted with additional immunization injections. Serum samples may be periodically obtained from the mice by retro orbital bleeding for testing in ELISA assays to detect anti BOC antibodies.

After a suitable antibody titer has been detected the animals positive for antibodies can be injected with a final intravenous injection of BOC and or CDO polypeptide. Three to four days later the mice are sacrificed and the spleen cells are harvested. The spleen cells are then fused using 35 polyethylene glycol to a selected murine myeloma cell line such as P3X63AgU.1 available from ATCC No. CRL 1597. The fusions generate hybridoma cells which can then be plated in 96 well tissue culture plates containing HAT hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine medium to inhibit proliferation of non fused cells myeloma hybrids and spleen cell hybrids.

The hybridoma cells are screened in an ELISA for reactivity against BOC and or CDO. Determination of positive hybridoma cells secreting the desired monoclonal antibodies against BOC and or CDO is within the skill in the art.

The positive hybridoma cells can be injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic Balb c mice to produce ascites containing the anti BOC and or anti CDO monoclonal antibodies. Alternatively the hybridoma cells can be grown in tissue culture flasks or roller bottles. Purification of the monoclonal antibodies produced in the ascites can be accomplished using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography. Alternatively affinity chromatography based upon binding of antibody to protein A or protein G can be employed.

The use of antibody drug conjugates ADC i.e. immunoconjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer Payne 2003 3 207 212 Syrigos and Epenetos 1999 19 605 614 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 1997 26 151 172 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. 1986 Mar. 15 1986 pp. 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications Pinchera et al. eds. pp. 475 506 . Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Efforts to design and refine ADC have focused on the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies mAbs as well as drug linking and drug releasing properties. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 1986 21 183 87 . Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. 1986 supra . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al. 2000 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al. 2000 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al. 2002 13 786 791 maytansinoids EP 1391213 Liu et al. 1996 93 8618 8623 and calicheamicin Lode et al. 1998 58 2928 Hinman et al. 1993 53 3336 3342 .

Techniques for producing antibody drug conjugates by linking toxins to purified antibodies are well known and routinely employed in the art. For example conjugation of a purified monoclonal antibody to the toxin DM1 may be accomplished as follows. Purified antibody is derivatized with N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate to introduce dithiopyridyl groups. Antibody 376.0 mg 8 mg mL in 44.7 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 containing NaCl 50 mM and EDTA 1 mM is treated with SPP 5.3 molar equivalents in 2.3 ml ethanol . After incubation for 90 minutes under argon at ambient temperature the reaction mixture is gel filtered through a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 35 mM sodium citrate 154 mM NaCl and 2 mM EDTA. Antibody containing fractions are then pooled and assayed. Antibody SPP Py 337.0 mg with releasable 2 thiopyridine groups is diluted with the above 35 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 6.5 to a final concentration of 2.5 mg ml. DM1 1.7 equivalents 16.1 mols in 3.0 mM dimethylacetamide DMA 3 v v in the final reaction mixture is then added to the antibody solution. The reaction is allowed to proceed at ambient temperature under argon for 20 hours. The reaction is loaded on a Sephacryl S300 gel filtration column 5.0 cm 90.0 cm 1.77 L equilibrated with 35 mM sodium citrate 154 mM NaCl pH 6.5. The flow rate is 5.0 ml min and 65 fractions 20.0 ml each are collected. Fractions are pooled and assayed wherein the number of DM1 drug molecules linked per antibody molecule p is determined by measuring the absorbance at 252 nm and 280 nm.

For illustrative purposes conjugation of a purified monoclonal antibody to the toxin DM1 may also be accomplished as follows. Purified antibody is derivatized with Succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC Pierce Biotechnology Inc to introduce the SMCC linker. The antibody is treated at 20 mg ml in 50 mM potassium phosphate 50 mM sodium chloride 2 mM EDTA pH 6.5 with 7.5 molar equivalents of SMCC 20 mM in DMSO 6.7 mg ml . After stirring for 2 hours under argon at ambient temperature the reaction mixture is filtered through a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate 50 mM sodium chloride 2 mM EDTA pH 6.5. Antibody containing fractions are pooled and assayed. Antibody SMCC is then diluted with 50 mM potassium phosphate 50 mM sodium chloride 2 mM EDTA pH 6.5 to a final concentration of 10 mg ml and reacted with a 10 mM solution of DM1 1.7 equivalents assuming 5 SMCC antibody 7.37 mg ml in dimethylacetamide. The reaction is stirred at ambient temperature under argon 16.5 hours. The conjugation reaction mixture is then filtered through a Sephadex G25 gel filtration column 1.5 4.9 cm with 1 PBS at pH 6.5. The DM1 antibody ratio p is then measured by the absorbance at 252 nm and at 280 nm.

Cytotoxic drugs have typically been conjugated to antibodies through the often numerous lysine residues of the antibody. Conjugation through thiol groups present or engineered into the antibody of interest has also been accomplished. For example cysteine residues have been introduced into proteins by genetic engineering techniques to form covalent attachment sites for ligands Better et al. 1994 13 9644 9650 Bernhard et al. 1994 5 126 132 Greenwood et al. 1994 1 247 255 Tu et al. 1999 96 4862 4867 Kanno et al 2000 76 207 214 Chmura et al. 2001 98 15 8480 8484 U.S. Pat. No. 6 248 564 . Once a free cysteine residue exists in the antibody of interest toxins can be linked to that site. As an example the drug linker reagents maleimidocaproyl monomethyl auristatin E MMAE i.e. MC MMAE maleimidocaproyl monomethyl auristatin F MMAF i.e. MC MMAF MC val cit PAB MMAE or MC val cit PAB MMAF dissolved in DMSO is diluted in acetonitrile and water at known concentration and added to chilled cysteine derivatized antibody in phosphate buffered saline PBS . After about one hour an excess of maleimide is added to quench the reaction and cap any unreacted antibody thiol groups. The reaction mixture is concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and the toxin conjugated antibody is purified and desalted by elution through G25 resin in PBS filtered through 0.2 m filters under sterile conditions and frozen for storage.

Moreover a free cysteine on an antibody of choice may be modified by the bis maleimido reagent BM PEO 4 Pierce Chemical leaving an unreacted maleimido group on the surface of the antibody. This may be accomplished by dissolving BM PEO 4 in a 50 ethanol water mixture to a concentration of 10 mM and adding a tenfold molar excess to a solution containing the antibody in phosphate buffered saline at a concentration of approximately 1.6 mg ml 10 micromolar and allowing it to react for 1 hour. Excess BM PEO 4 is removed by gel filtration in 30 mM citrate pH 6 with 150 mM NaCl buffer. An approximate 10 fold molar excess DM1 is dissolved in dimethyl acetamide DMA and added to the antibody BMPEO intermediate. Dimethyl formamide DMF may also be employed to dissolve the drug moiety reagent. The reaction mixture is allowed to react overnight before gel filtration or dialysis into PBS to remove unreacted drug. Gel filtration on S200 columns in PBS is used to remove high molecular weight aggregates and furnish purified antibody BMPEO DM1 conjugate.

Mammalian cells expressing the BOC and or CDO polypeptide of interest may be obtained using standard expression vector and cloning techniques. Alternatively many tumor cell lines expressing BOC and or CDO polypeptides of interest are publicly available for example through the ATCC and can be routinely identified using standard ELISA or FACS analysis. Anti BOC and or anti CDO monoclonal antibodies and toxin conjugated derivatives thereof may then be employed in assays to determine the ability of the antibody to kill BOC polypeptide expressing cells in vitro.

With specific regard to the present invention a PC3 derived cell line that stably expresses BOC and or CDO polypeptide on its cells surface herein called PC3 gD MDP may be engineered using standard techniques and expression of the BOC and or CDO polypeptide by the PC3 gD MDP cells can be confirmed using standard FACS cell sorting ELISA and immunohistochemistry analyses. The ability of an MMAE conjugated anti BOC and or anti CDO monoclonal antibody to cause the death of the respective BOC and or CDO expressing cells may be determined using an in vitro cell killing assay employing the following protocol Promega Corp. Technical Bulletin TB288 Mendoza et al 2002 62 5485 5488 

The results obtained from the above described assay can demonstrate that the BOC MMAE and or CDO MMAE antibody is capable of inducing the death of cells that express the corresponding BOC and or CDO polypeptide in an antibody dependent fashion. That is neither BOC MMAE and or CDO MMAE nor MMAE conjugated control can induce significant death of untransfected PC3 cells at an antibody concentration of 1 g ml and below. At antibody concentrations above 1 g ml the amount of untransfected PC3 cell death may increase linearly with antibody concentration in an antibody independent manner. Therefore it will appear that the death of untransfected PC3 cells at antibody concentrations above 1 g ml is a non specific result of the increasing levels of the MMAE toxin present in the reaction mixture and is not a function of the binding specificity of the antibody employed.

With regard to the PC3 gD MDP cells that stably express the BOC and or CDO polypeptide however while the MMAE conjugated control induces cell death with a pattern that is identical to that antibody s ability to kill untransfected PC3 cells the BOC MMAE and or CDO MMAE will induce significant cell killing at antibody concentrations significantly below this level e.g. as low as 0.001 g ml . In fact at an antibody concentration of 1 g ml where the non BOC specific and or non CDO specific MMAE conjugated control antibody exhibits no significant cell killing virtually all of the BOC and or CDO expressing PC3 gD MDP cells will be killed by the respective BOC MMAE and or CDO MMAE. As such such data will demonstrate that BOC specific and or CDO specific monoclonal antibody binds to the BOC and or CDO polypeptide as it is expressed on the surface of cells and is capable of inducing the death of those cells to which it binds.

To test the efficacy of toxin conjugated or unconjugated anti BOC and or anti CDO monoclonal antibodies for the ability to induce the death of tumor cells in vivo the following protocol may be employed.

Inoculate a group of athymic nude mice with 5 10of the BOC polypeptide expressing tumor promoting cells subcutaneously in the flank. When the tumors reach a mean tumor volume of between 100 200 mm the mice are grouped equally into 5 groups and are treated as follows 

The following method describes use of a nucleotide sequence encoding BOC polypeptide and or CDO polypeptide as a hybridization probe for i.e. diagnosis of the presence of a tumor in a mammal.

DNA comprising the coding sequence of full length or mature BOC and or CDO polypeptide as disclosed herein can also be employed as a probe to screen for homologous DNAs such as those encoding naturally occurring variants of BOC or CDO in human tissue cDNA libraries or human tissue genomic libraries.

Hybridization and washing of filters containing either library DNAs is performed under the following high stringency conditions. Hybridization of radiolabeled BOC and or CDO derived probe to the filters is performed in a solution of 50 formamide 5 SSC 0.1 SDS 0.1 sodium pyrophosphate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8 2 Denhardt s solution and 10 dextran sulfate at 42 C. for 20 hours. Washing of the filters is performed in an aqueous solution of 0.1 SSC and 0.1 SDS at 42 C.

DNAs having a desired sequence identity with the DNA encoding full length native sequence BOC and or CDO polypeptide can then be identified using standard techniques known in the art.

This example illustrates preparation of an unglycosylated form of BOC and or CDO by recombinant expression in

The DNA sequence encoding the preceding BOC and or CDO polypeptide sequences is initially amplified using selected PCR primers. The primers should contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the selected expression vector. A variety of expression vectors may be employed. An example of a suitable vector is pBR322 derived from see Bolivar et al. 2 95 1977 which contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance. The vector is digested with restriction enzyme and dephosphorylated. The PCR amplified sequences are then ligated into the vector. The vector will preferably include sequences which encode for an antibiotic resistance gene a trp promoter a polyhis leader including the first six STII codons polyhis sequence and enterokinase cleavage site the BOC and or CDO coding region lambda transcriptional terminator and an argU gene.

The ligation mixture is then used to transform a selected strain using the methods described in Sambrook et al. supra. Transformants are identified by their ability to grow on LB plates and antibiotic resistant colonies are then selected. Plasmid DNA can be isolated and confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing.

Selected clones can be grown overnight in liquid culture medium such as LB broth supplemented with antibiotics. The overnight culture may subsequently be used to inoculate a larger scale culture. The cells are then grown to a desired optical density during which the expression promoter is turned on.

After culturing the cells for several more hours the cells can be harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet obtained by the centrifugation can be solubilized using various agents known in the art and the solubilized BOC and or CDO polypeptide can then be purified using a metal chelating column under conditions that allow tight binding of the protein.

The preceding BOC and or CDO polypeptide sequences may be expressed in in a poly His tagged form using the following procedure. The DNA encoding BOC and or CDO is initially amplified using selected PCR primers. The primers will contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the selected expression vector and other useful sequences providing for efficient and reliable translation initiation rapid purification on a metal chelation column and proteolytic removal with enterokinase. The PCR amplified poly His tagged sequences are then ligated into an expression vector which is used to transform an host based on strain 52 W3110 fuhA tonA lon gale rpoHts htpRts clpP lacIq . Transformants are first grown in LB containing 50 mg ml carbenicillin at 30 C. with shaking until an O.D.600 of 3 5 is reached. Cultures are then diluted 50 100 fold into CRAP media prepared by mixing 3.57 g NH SO 0.71 g sodium citrate 2H2O 1.07 g KCl 5.36 g Difco yeast extract 5.36 g Sheffield hycase SF in 500 mL water as well as 110 mM MPOS pH 7.3 0.55 w v glucose and 7 mM MgSO and grown for approximately 20 30 hours at 30 C. with shaking. Samples are removed to verify expression by SDS PAGE analysis and the bulk culture is centrifuged to pellet the cells. Cell pellets are frozen until purification and refolding.

The proteins are refolded by diluting the sample slowly into freshly prepared refolding buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris pH 8.6 0.3 M NaCl 2.5 M urea 5 mM cysteine 20 mM glycine and 1 mM EDTA. Refolding volumes are chosen so that the final protein concentration is between 50 to 100 micrograms ml. The refolding solution is stirred gently at 4 C. for 12 36 hours. The refolding reaction is quenched by the addition of TFA to a final concentration of 0.4 pH of approximately 3 . Before further purification of the protein the solution is filtered through a 0.22 micron filter and acetonitrile is added to 2 10 final concentration. The refolded protein is chromatographed on a Poros R1 H reversed phase column using a mobile buffer of 0.1 TFA with elution with a gradient of acetonitrile from 10 to 80 . Aliquots of fractions with A280 absorbance are analyzed on SDS polyacrylamide gels and fractions containing homogeneous refolded protein are pooled. Generally the properly refolded species of most proteins are eluted at the lowest concentrations of acetonitrile since those species are the most compact with their hydrophobic interiors shielded from interaction with the reversed phase resin. Aggregated species are usually eluted at higher acetonitrile concentrations. In addition to resolving misfolded forms of proteins from the desired form the reversed phase step also removes endotoxin from the samples.

Fractions containing the desired folded protein are pooled and the acetonitrile removed using a gentle stream of nitrogen directed at the solution. Proteins are formulated into 20 mM Hepes pH 6.8 with 0.14 M sodium chloride and 4 mannitol by dialysis or by gel filtration using G25 Superfine Pharmacia resins equilibrated in the formulation buffer and sterile filtered.

This example illustrates preparation of a potentially glycosylated form of BOC and or CDO polypeptide by recombinant expression in mammalian cells.

The vector pRK5 see EP 307 247 published Mar. 15 1989 is employed as the expression vector. Optionally DNA encoding the BOC or CDO polypeptides described herein is ligated into pRK5 with selected restriction enzymes to allow insertion of such DNA using ligation methods such as described in Sambrook et al. supra. The resulting vector is called BOC DNA or CDO DNA respectively.

In one embodiment the selected host cells may be 293 cells. Human 293 cells ATCC CCL 1573 are grown to confluence in tissue culture plates in medium such as DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum and optionally nutrient components and or antibiotics. About 10 g pRK5 BOC DNA or pRK5 CDO DNA is mixed with about 1 g DNA encoding the VA RNA gene Thimmappaya et al. 31 543 1982 and dissolved in 500 l of 1 mM Tris HCl 0.1 mM EDTA 0.227 M CaCl. To this mixture is added dropwise 500 l of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.35 280 mM NaCl 1.5 mM NaPO and a precipitate is allowed to form for 10 minutes at 25 C. The precipitate is suspended and added to the 293 cells and allowed to settle for about four hours at 37 C. The culture medium is aspirated off and 2 ml of 20 glycerol in PBS is added for 30 seconds. The 293 cells are then washed with serum free medium fresh medium is added and the cells are incubated for about 5 days.

Approximately 24 hours after the transfections the culture medium is removed and replaced with culture medium alone or culture medium containing 200 Ci ml S cysteine and 200 Ci ml S methionine. After a 12 hour incubation the conditioned medium is collected concentrated on a spin filter and loaded onto a 15 SDS gel. The processed gel may be dried and exposed to film for a selected period of time to reveal the presence of the BOC and or CDO polypeptides. The cultures containing transfected cells may undergo further incubation in serum free medium and the medium is tested in selected bioassays.

In an alternative technique DNA encoding the BOC and or CDO polypeptides may be introduced into 293 cells transiently using the dextran sulfate method described by Somparyrac et al. 12 7575 1981 . 293 cells are grown to maximal density in a spinner flask and 700 g pRK5 BOC DNA is added. The cells are first concentrated from the spinner flask by centrifugation and washed with PBS. The DNA dextran precipitate is incubated on the cell pellet for four hours. The cells are treated with 20 glycerol for 90 seconds washed with tissue culture medium and re introduced into the spinner flask containing tissue culture medium 5 g ml bovine insulin and 0.1 g ml bovine transferrin. After about four days the conditioned media is centrifuged and filtered to remove cells and debris. The sample containing expressed BOC and or CDO can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method such as dialysis and or column chromatography.

In another embodiment the BOC and or CDO polypeptide can be expressed in CHO cells. The pRK5 BOC pRK5 CDO can be transfected into CHO cells using known reagents such as CaPOor DEAE dextran. As described above the cell cultures can be incubated and the medium replaced with culture medium alone or medium containing a radiolabel such as S methionine. After determining the presence of the BOC and or CDO the culture medium may be replaced with serum free medium. Preferably the cultures are incubated for about 6 days and then the conditioned medium is harvested. The medium containing the expressed BOC and or CDO polypeptide can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method.

Epitope tagged BOC and or CDO polypeptide may also be expressed in host CHO cells. The sequence encoding the BOC and or CDO portion may be subcloned out of the pRK5 vector. The subclone insert can undergo PCR to fuse in frame with a selected epitope tag such as a poly his tag into a Baculovirus expression vector. This poly his tagged BOC and or CDO insert can then be subcloned into a SV40 driven vector containing a selection marker such as DHFR for selection of stable clones. Finally the CHO cells can be transfected as described above with the SV40 driven vector. Labeling may be performed as described above to verify expression. The culture medium containing the expressed poly His tagged BOC and or CDO can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method such as by Ni chelate affinity chromatography.

BOC and or CDO polypeptide may also be expressed in CHO and or COS cells by a transient expression procedure or in CHO cells by another stable expression procedure.

Stable expression in CHO cells is performed using the following procedure. The proteins are expressed as an IgG construct immunoadhesin in which the coding sequences for the soluble forms e.g. extracellular domains of the respective proteins are fused to an IgG1 constant region sequence containing the hinge CH2 and CH2 domains and or is a poly His tagged form.

Following PCR amplification the respective DNAs are subcloned in a CHO expression vector using standard techniques as described in Ausubel et al. Unit 3.16 John Wiley and Sons 1997 . CHO expression vectors are constructed to have compatible restriction sites 5 and 3 of the DNA of interest to allow the convenient shuttling of cDNA s. The vector used expression in CHO cells is as described in Lucas et al. 24 9 1774 1779 1996 and uses the SV40 early promoter enhancer to drive expression of the cDNA of interest and dihydrofolate reductase DHFR . DHFR expression permits selection for stable maintenance of the plasmid following transfection.

Twelve micrograms of the desired plasmid DNA is introduced into approximately 10 million CHO cells using commercially available transfection reagents SUPERFECT Quiagen DOSPER or FUGENE Boehringer Mannheim . The cells are grown as described in Lucas et al. supra. Approximately 3 10cells are frozen in an ampule for further growth and production as described below.

The ampules containing the plasmid DNA are thawed by placement into water bath and mixed by vortexing. The contents are pipetted into a centrifuge tube containing 10 mLs of media and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant is aspirated and the cells are resuspended in 10 mL of selective media 0.2 m filtered PS20 with 5 0.2 m diafiltered fetal bovine serum . The cells are then aliquoted into a 100 mL spinner containing 90 mL of selective media. After 1 2 days the cells are transferred into a 250 mL spinner filled with 150 mL selective growth medium and incubated at 37 C. After another 2 3 days 250 mL 500 mL and 2000 mL spinners are seeded with 3 10cells mL. The cell media is exchanged with fresh media by centrifugation and resuspension in production medium. Although any suitable CHO media may be employed a production medium described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 469 issued Jun. 16 1992 may actually be used. A 3L production spinner is seeded at 1.2 10cells mL. On day 0 the cell number pH ie determined. On day 1 the spinner is sampled and sparging with filtered air is commenced. On day 2 the spinner is sampled the temperature shifted to 33 C. and 30 mL of 500 g L glucose and 0.6 mL of 10 antifoam e.g. 35 polydimethylsiloxane emulsion Dow Corning 365 Medical Grade Emulsion taken. Throughout the production the pH is adjusted as necessary to keep it at around 7.2. After 10 days or until the viability dropped below 70 the cell culture is harvested by centrifugation and filtering through a 0.22 m filter. The filtrate was either stored at 4 C. or immediately loaded onto columns for purification.

For the poly His tagged constructs the proteins are purified using a Ni NTA column Qiagen . Before purification imidazole is added to the conditioned media to a concentration of 5 mM. The conditioned media is pumped onto a 6 ml Ni NTA column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole at a flow rate of 4 5 ml min. at 4 C. After loading the column is washed with additional equilibration buffer and the protein eluted with equilibration buffer containing 0.25 M imidazole. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into a storage buffer containing 10 mM Hepes 0.14 M NaCl and 4 mannitol pH 6.8 with a 25 ml G25 Superfine Pharmacia column and stored at 80 C.

Immunoadhesin Fc containing constructs are purified from the conditioned media as follows. The conditioned medium is pumped onto a 5 ml Protein A column Pharmacia which had been equilibrated in 20 mM Na phosphate buffer pH 6.8. After loading the column is washed extensively with equilibration buffer before elution with 100 mM citric acid pH 3.5. The eluted protein is immediately neutralized by collecting 1 ml fractions into tubes containing 275 L of 1 M Tris buffer pH 9. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into storage buffer as described above for the poly His tagged proteins. The homogeneity is assessed by SDS polyacrylamide gels and by N terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation.

First yeast expression vectors are constructed for intracellular production or secretion of the preceding BOC or CDO sequences from the ADH2 GAPDH promoter. DNA encoding such BOC or CDO sequences and the promoter is inserted into suitable restriction enzyme sites in the selected plasmid to direct intracellular expression of BOC or CDO. For secretion DNA encoding such BOC or CDO sequences can be cloned into the selected plasmid together with DNA encoding the ADH2 GAPDH promoter a native BOC or CDO signal peptide or other mammalian signal peptide or for example a yeast alpha factor or invertase secretory signal leader sequence and linker sequences if needed for expression of BOC.

Yeast cells such as yeast strain AB110 can then be transformed with the expression plasmids described above and cultured in selected fermentation media. The transformed yeast supernatants can be analyzed by precipitation with 10 trichloroacetic acid and separation by SDS PAGE followed by staining of the gels with Coomassie Blue stain.

Recombinant BOC or CDO can subsequently be isolated and purified by removing the yeast cells from the fermentation medium by centrifugation and then concentrating the medium using selected cartridge filters. The concentrate containing BOC may further be purified using selected column chromatography resins.

The following method describes recombinant expression of BOC or CDO polypeptide in Baculovirus infected insect cells.

The sequence coding for the preceding BOC or CDO sequence is fused upstream of an epitope tag contained within a baculovirus expression vector. Such epitope tags include poly his tags and immunoglobulin tags like Fc regions of IgG . A variety of plasmids may be employed including plasmids derived from commercially available plasmids such as pVL1393 Novagen . Briefly the sequence encoding the preceding BOC or CDO sequence or the desired portion of the coding sequence of such e.g. the sequence encoding an extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein or the sequence encoding the mature protein if the protein is extracellular is amplified by PCR with primers complementary to the 5 and 3 regions. The 5 primer may incorporate flanking selected restriction enzyme sites. The product is then digested with those selected restriction enzymes and subcloned into the expression vector.

Recombinant baculovirus is generated by co transfecting the above plasmid and BACULOGOLD virus DNA Pharmingen into Sf9 cells ATCC CRL 1711 using lipofectin commercially available from GIBCO BRL . After 4 5 days of incubation at 28 C. the released viruses are harvested and used for further amplifications. Viral infection and protein expression are performed as described by O Reilley et al. Oxford Oxford University Press 1994 .

Expressed poly his tagged BOC or CDO polypeptide can then be purified for example by Ni chelate affinity chromatography as follows. Extracts are prepared from recombinant virus infected Sf9 cells as described by Rupert et al. 362 175 179 1993 . Briefly Sf9 cells are washed resuspended in sonication buffer 25 mL Hepes pH 7.9 12.5 mM MgCl 0.1 mM EDTA 10 glycerol 0.1 NP 40 0.4 M KCl and sonicated twice for 20 seconds on ice. The sonicates are cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant is diluted 50 fold in loading buffer 50 mM phosphate 300 mM NaCl 10 glycerol pH 7.8 and filtered through a 0.45 m filter. A Ni NTA agarose column commercially available from Qiagen is prepared with a bed volume of 5 mL washed with 25 mL of water and equilibrated with 25 mL of loading buffer. The filtered cell extract is loaded onto the column at 0.5 mL per minute. The column is washed to baseline Awith loading buffer at which point fraction collection is started. Next the column is washed with a secondary wash buffer 50 mM phosphate 300 mM NaCl 10 glycerol pH 6.0 which elutes nonspecifically bound protein. After reaching Abaseline again the column is developed with a 0 to 500 mM Imidazole gradient in the secondary wash buffer. One mL fractions are collected and analyzed by SDS PAGE and silver staining or Western blot with Ni NTA conjugated to alkaline phosphatase Qiagen . Fractions containing the eluted His tagged BOC polypeptide are pooled and dialyzed against loading buffer.

Alternatively purification of the IgG tagged or Fc tagged BOC or CDO polypeptide can be performed using known chromatography techniques including for instance Protein A or protein G column chromatography.

Native or recombinant BOC or CDO polypeptides may be purified by a variety of standard techniques in the art of protein purification. For example pro mature or pre polypeptide variants of the preceding BOC or CDO sequences are purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies specific for such sequences. In general an immunoaffinity column is constructed by covalently coupling the respective anti BOC or anti CDO antibody to an activated chromatographic resin.

Polyclonal immunoglobulins are prepared from immune sera either by precipitation with ammonium sulfate or by purification on immobilized Protein A Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Piscataway N.J. . Likewise monoclonal antibodies are prepared from mouse ascites fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation or chromatography on immobilized Protein A. Partially purified immunoglobulin is covalently attached to a chromatographic resin such as CnBr activated SEPHAROSE Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology . The antibody is coupled to the resin the resin is blocked and the derivative resin is washed according to the manufacturer s instructions.

Such an immunoaffinity column is utilized in the purification of the preceding BOC or CDO sequences by preparing a fraction from cells containing such sequences in a soluble form. This preparation is derived by solubilization of the whole cell or of a subcellular fraction obtained via differential centrifugation by the addition of detergent or by other methods well known in the art. Alternatively soluble BOC or CDO polypeptide containing a signal sequence may be secreted in useful quantity into the medium in which the cells are grown.

A soluble BOC or CDO polypeptide containing preparation is passed over the immunoaffinity column and the column is washed under conditions that allow the preferential absorbance of such sequences e.g. high ionic strength buffers in the presence of detergent . Then the column is eluted under conditions that disrupt the binding between the antibody substrate e.g. a low pH buffer such as approximately pH 2 3 or a high concentration of a chaotrope such as urea or thiocyanate ion and BOC or CDO polypeptide respectively is collected.

This assay is designed to determine whether the tested polypeptide shows the ability to modulate proliferation of pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture and therefore function as useful growth or inhibitory factors.

On day 0 pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells from cell lines maximum of 12 14 passages were plated in 96 well plates at 1000 cells well per 100 microliter and incubated overnight in complete media epithelial cell growth media EGM Clonetics plus supplements human epithelial growth factor hEGF bovine brain extract BBE hydrocortisone GA 1000 and fetal bovine serum FBS Clonetics . On day 1 complete media was replaced by basal media EGM plus 1 FBS and addition of BOC or CDO polypeptides at 1 0.1 and 0.01 . On day 7 an assessment of cell proliferation was performed by Alamar Blue assay followed by Crystal Violet. Results are expresses as of the cell growth observed with control buffer.

Nucleic acid microarrays often containing thousands of gene sequences are useful for identifying differentially expressed genes in diseased tissues as compared to their normal counterparts. Using nucleic acid microarrays test and control mRNA samples from test and control tissue samples are reverse transcribed and labeled to generate cDNA probes. The cDNA probes are then hybridized to an array of nucleic acids immobilized on a solid support. The array is configured such that the sequence and position of each member of the array is known. For example a selection of genes known to be expressed in certain disease states may be arrayed on a solid support. Hybridization of a labeled probe with a particular array member indicates that the sample from which the probe was derived expresses that gene. If the hybridization signal of a probe from a test disease tissue sample is greater than hybridization signal of a probe from a control normal tissue sample the gene or genes overexpressed in the disease tissue are identified. The implication of this result is that an overexpressed protein in a diseased tissue is useful not only as a diagnostic marker for the presence of the disease condition but also as a therapeutic target for treatment of the disease condition.

The methodology of hybridization of nucleic acids and microarray technology is well known in the art. In the present example the specific preparation of nucleic acids for hybridization and probes slides and hybridization conditions are all detailed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 193 767 filed on Mar. 31 2000 and which is herein incorporated by reference.

In the present example cancerous tumors derived from various human tissues were studied for BOC and or CDO polypeptide encoding gene expression relative to non cancerous human tissue in an attempt to identify those BOC and or CDO polypeptides which are overexpressed in cancerous tumors. Two sets of experimental data were generated. In one set cancerous human colon tumor tissue and matched non cancerous human colon tumor tissue from the same patient matched colon control were obtained and analyzed for BOC and or CDO polypeptide expression using the above described microarray technology. In the second set of data cancerous human tumor tissue from any of a variety of different human tumors was obtained and compared to a universal epithelial control sample which was prepared by pooling non cancerous human tissues of epithelial origin including liver kidney and lung. mRNA isolated from the pooled tissues represents a mixture of expressed gene products from these different tissues. Microarray hybridization experiments using the pooled control samples generated a linear plot in a 2 color analysis. The slope of the line generated in a 2 color analysis was then used to normalize the ratios of test control detection within each experiment. The normalized ratios from various experiments were then compared and used to identify clustering of gene expression. Thus the pooled universal control sample not only allowed effective relative gene expression determinations in a simple 2 sample comparison it also allowed multi sample comparisons across several experiments.

In the present experiments nucleic acid probes derived from the herein described BOC and or CDO polypeptide encoding nucleic acid sequences were used in the creation of the microarray and RNA from the tumor tissues listed above were used for the hybridization thereto. A value based upon the normalized ratio experimental ratio was designated as a cutoff ratio . Only values that were above this cutoff ratio were determined to be significant. Table 7 below shows the results of these experiments demonstrating that various BOC and or CDO polypeptides of the present invention are significantly overexpressed in various human tumor tissues as compared to a non cancerous human tissue control. As described above these data demonstrate that the BOC and or PRO polypeptides of the present invention are useful not only as diagnostic markers for the presence of one or more cancerous tumors but also serve as therapeutic targets for the treatment of those tumors.

To investigate the role of PRO1190 and PRO38430 genes are produced by homologous recombination or retroviral insertion techniques. Specifically transgenic mice comprising disruptions in PRO1190 and or PRO38430 genes i.e. knockout mice are created by either gene targeting or gene trapping. Mutations are confirmed by southern blot analysis to confirm correct targeting on both the 5 and 3 ends. Gene specific genotyping is also performed by genomic PCR to confirm the loss of the endogenous native transcript as demonstrated by RT PCR using primers that anneal to exons flanking the site of insertion. Targeting vectors are electroporated into 129 strain ES cells and targeted clones are identified. Targeted clones are microinjected into host blastocysts to produce chimeras. Chimeras are bred with C57 animals to produce F1 heterozygotes. Heterozygotes are intercrossed to produce F2 wildtype heterozygote and homozygote cohorts which are used for phenotypic analysis. If insufficient F1 heterozygotes are produced the F1 hets can be bred to wildtype C57 mice to produce sufficient heterozygotes to breed for cohorts to be analyzed for a phenotype. All phenotypic analysis is performed from 12 16 weeks after birth.

In these knockout experiments the gene encoding BOC PRO1190 polypeptides designated as DNA59586 1520 UNQ604 and or CDO PRO38430 DNA2279967 UNQ9067 is disrupted.

The mouse gene of interest is Boc biregional cell adhesion molecule related down regulated by oncogenes Cdon binding protein ortholog of human BOC brother of CDO . Aliases include 4732455C11 and Biregional Cdon binding protein.

BOC is a type I plasma membrane protein that likely functions as a receptor subunit for cell cell communication. The protein interacts with homolog CDON cell adhesion molecule related down regulated by oncogenes N cadherins and M cadherins in a cis fashion forming a receptor complex at sites of cell cell contact in myoblasts. During embryonic development BOC is expressed in musculoskeletal and central nervous systems and in areas of proliferation and differentiation. BOC likely plays a role in muscle cell differentiation and transformation Wegorzewska et al 37 1 1 4 2003 Mulieri et al 223 3 379 88 2002 Kang et al 21 1 2 114 24 2002 Kang et al 100 7 3989 94 2003 .

Targeted or gene trap mutations are generated in strain 129SvEv derived embryonic stem ES cells. The chimeric mice are bred to C57BL 6J albino mice to generate F1 heterozygous animals. These progeny are intercrossed to generate F2 wild type heterozygous and homozygous mutant progeny. On rare occasions for example when very few F1 mice are obtained from the chimera F1 heterozygous mice are crossed to 129SvEv C57 hybrid mice to yield additional heterozygous animals for the intercross to generate the F2 mice. Level I phenotypic analysis is performed on mice from this generation

Cos7 cells were transfected with known Shh binding cell surface proteins including Hip hPTCH1 plus several negative controls and incubated with Shh AP alkaline phosphatase is fused at amino terminal of N Shh conditioned medium at room temperature for 1 hr before examination of AP activity on the cell surface. As shown in Hip a cell surface Hh interacting protein accumulates on the cell surface and binds Shh AP as indicated by the staining of alkaline phosphatase. Both BOC and the Hh receptor hPTCH1 also bind Shh AP on the cell surface. No staining was detected when cell were transfected negative control proteins WIF or SFRP secreted Frizzled Related Protein known to interact with Wnts or incubated with AP conditioned medium alone data not shown . The intensity of the alkaline phosphatase signal reflects how much receptor protein accumulation on the cell surface. Only weak binding of Hh to hPtch2 was detected reflecting the lack of hPtch2 accumulation at the cell surface.

To explore whether BOC binding to Shh at the cell surface affects Hh induced signaling we transfected 10T1 2 cell with expression construct for BOC and a Gli Luciferase reporter constructas readout for Hh signaling. These cells were then mixed with 10T1 2 cells transiently transfected with full length Shh. As shown in BOC overexpression on Hh receiving cell inhibited Shh signaling to a similar level as Ptch1 overexpression suggesting that BOC can inhibit Hh signaling either through ligand trapping or through inhibition of downstream signaling.

At early stage of embryonic development between embryonic day 7.5 and 9.5 BOC is expressed in dorsal neural plate before neural tube closure and at the dorsal neural tube after tube closure. At embryonic day 10 BOC expression is detected in dosal root ganlion DRG anterior limb and nasal epithelium. BOC is expressed in area that generally is not exposed to Hh ligand. The protein is enriched on the opposite field of Hh signaling source ventral neural tube and posterior limb bud very likely to ensure the proper silencing of Hh signaling in dorsal neural tube and anterior limb bud. The expression pattern of BOC indicates that it may be a potential transcriptional target suppressed by active Hh signaling. One may see upregulation of BOC transcription in Shh knockout animal.

CDO is a cell surface receptor like protein containing give Ig repeats and three fibronectin FN type III repeats in its extracellular region. The ectodomain of CDO is very similar to BOC which has four Ig repeats and three FN type III domains. The intracellular domain of BOC and CDO do not resemble each other . Both BOC and CDO bind to Shh AP on the cell surface .

CDO and BOC are differentially regulated by hedgehog signaling in medulloblastoma allografts a model in which Hh signaling is upregulated due to loss of one allele of Patched 1. Treatment of medullo allografts with the hedgehog antagonist CUR691 described in US20050085519 published Apr. 21 2005 which is herein incorporated by reference blocks Hh signaling as indicated by the downregulation of the Hh target gene Gli 1 . While BOC is downregulated CDO is upregulated in response to CUR691 treatment indicating that both BOC and CDO are transcriptional targets of the Hh pathway and indicate that each plays opposing roles in modulating the Hh signaling pathway.

Indeed the overexpression of BOC in 10T1 2 cell culture inhibits Hh signaling at saturating Shh concentration. In contrast over expression of a truncated form of CDO CDO cyt CDO lacking the cytoplasmic tail potentiates Hh signaling responses at suboptimum Shh concentration. This suggests that the ectodomain can agonize or amplify Hh signaling and that antagonists targeting this region or the extracellular portion thereof e.g. anti CDO antibodies may have therapeutic utility in inhibiting Hh signaling in target cells .
