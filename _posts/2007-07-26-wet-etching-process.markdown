MEMS devices are based on using microelectronic wafer fabrication techniques to produce complex shapes in the m to mm size range with embedded sensors actuators and circuitry. More than a dimension MEMS is a way of manufacturing. Presently two types of bulk silicon etching are predominantly used namely wet and dry etching. Wet etching while offering process simplicity and low cost requires long hours for etching and results in sharp corners and 54.7 degree side wall angles. Dry etching technique namely the Deep reactive Ion etching DRIE overcomes the difficulties of wet etching allowing for arbitrary shapes but is an expensive process.

Thus there is a need for an etching technique which offers the simplicity of the wet etching and the process capabilities of dry etching. Such a technique will result in high aspect ratio anisotropic structures without any sidewall angles in a short period of time using standard wet etching methods.

The present invention provides a novel wet etching process useful in the fabrication of MEMS devices. In accordance with the present invention a bulk silicon etching method is provided including the steps of providing a silicon wafer diffusing the wafer with dopant whereby the diffusion creates a PN junction throughout the surface of the wafer providing a mask positioning the mask in overlying relation to the surface of the wafer 

applying a layer of oxide on the surface of the wafer patterning a layer of oxide on the surface of the wafer etching the wafer to create recessed areas coincident with the patterned oxide the recessed areas characterized by the absence of surface PN junction hydrofluoric acid etching the wafer to form porous silicon thereon whereby the porous silicon is formed coincident with the surface wafer area characterized by the absence of surface PN junction and subjecting the wafer surface to wet etching resulting in dissolution of the porous silicon.

In a particular embodiment the silicon wafer is an N type silicon wafer and the dopant is a P type dopant. Alternatively the wafer may be a P type silicon wafer and the dopant may be an N type dopant.

Various techniques are within the scope of the present invention for patterning the oxide layer on the surface of the wafer including but not limited to sputtering.

Various techniques are within the scope of the present invention for etching the oxide patterned on the wafer including but not limited to etching with potassium hydroxide KOH . In a particular embodiment the step of etching the oxide is accomplished by subjecting the wafer to potassium hydroxide etching for approximately ten minutes.

There are various techniques within the scope of the present invention for etching the porous silicon including but not limited to etching with potassium hydroxide KOH and etching with tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide TMAH . In a particular embodiment the porous silicon is subjected to etching utilizing either KOH or TMAH for approximately thirty seconds.

The method of the present invention provides significant lowering of fabrication costs through the utilization of cost effective wet etching techniques.

The present invention discloses an etching technique which offers the simplicity of wet etching and the process capabilities of dry etching. As such the method of the present invention results in the rapid fabrication of high aspect ratio anisotropic structures substantially devoid of sidewall angles. Accordingly the method presented is an alternative to deep reactive ion etching.

The present invention illustrates a bulk silicon etching technique that yields straight sidewalls through wafer structures in very short times using standard silicon wet etching techniques. In accordance with the present invention a method employing selective porous silicon formation and dissolution is used to create high aspect ratio structures with straight sidewalls for through wafer MEMS processing.

In an exemplary embodiment referring to an N type silicon wafer is diffused with P type dopant to the order of 1020 atoms cm2. Other ratios are additionally within the scope of the present invention. The diffusion creates a blanket PN junction through out the surface of the wafer.

A thin layer of oxide is then sputtered and patterned using the desired mass on top of the diffusion as shown with reference to .

The wafer is then subjected to KOH etching for ten minutes to create recessed areas where the oxide was patterned as shown with reference to . The patterning of oxide and the silicon beneath creates patterns of the surface which are contrasted by the presence and absence of PN junction.

As shown in porous silicon is formed on the patterned wafer using HF based electrochemical etching technique. In a particular embodiment the wafer is etched utilizing a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and ethanol to form the porous silicon. The pores are formed in areas that are characterized by the absence of surface junction. In the areas which have a surface junction the junction blocks the pore initiation and propagation due to lack of holes in the depletion region which are essential to porous silicon formation. The resultant wafer is selectively porous in the areas where the oxide was patterned and the rest of the wafer is bulk silicon.

This wafer is further subjected to KOH or TMAH etching for thirty seconds which results in rapid dissolution of porous areas leaving behind bulk silicon thus resulting in through wafer high aspect ration structures with straight sidewalls . The drastic reduction in etching time is due to the fact that in the porous areas the etching chemical encounters much higher surface area than in the non porous areas thus leading to very high selectivity.
