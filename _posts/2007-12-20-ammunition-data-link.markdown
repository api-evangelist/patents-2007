title: Ammunition data link
abstract: A cartridge includes a cartridge case base having a bottom surface, a primer and an annular recess formed in the bottom surface, the annular recess being concentric with the primer; first and second concentric conductive rings disposed in the annular recess, the first and second rings being radially spaced apart and substantially flush with the bottom surface of the cartridge case base, the first and second rings being electrically insulated from the cartridge case base and the primer; a first data pin electrically connected to the first conductive ring and extending into an interior of the cartridge case base; and a second data pin electrically connected to the second conductive ring and extending into the interior of the cartridge case base, the first and second data pins being electrically insulated from the cartridge case base.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to seeker and or fuze setting type or smart munitions.

Some gun launched cartridges such as 120 mm cartridges include onboard electronics for guidance and or fuzing. Prior to firing these cartridges data and or electrical power are transferred to the projectile using a data link. The data can include firing platform and downrange targeting information. Data transmission is initiated by the weapon s fire control system and transmitted through the breech of the gun into the cartridge. A known data link is embedded in the primer which is inserted into the standard 120 mm case base assembly. The data transmission point is the standard 120 mm firing pin. The case base itself provides the electrical ground necessary to complete the electrical firing circuit when the breech block is in the closed position.

In the primer based data link the data transmission circuit and the weapon s electrical firing circuit are the same. Thus data transmission is susceptible to line noise from the firing circuit. Furthermore there is some risk of unintended firing of the cartridge during data transmission. There is a need for a data link for a cartridge that is separate from the firing circuit for the cartridge.

It is an object of the invention to provide a gun launched cartridge having a data link that is isolated from the firing circuit and having two way communications between the weapon s fire control system and the cartridge while inside the gun chamber.

One aspect of the invention is a cartridge case comprising a cartridge case base having a bottom surface a primer and an annular recess formed in the bottom surface the annular recess being concentric with the primer first and second concentric conductive rings disposed in the annular recess the first and second rings being radially spaced apart and substantially flush with the bottom surface of the cartridge case base the first and second rings being electrically insulated from the cartridge case base and the primer a first data pin electrically connected to the first conductive ring and extending into an interior of the cartridge case base and a second data pin electrically connected to the second conductive ring and extending into the interior of the cartridge case base the first and second data pins being electrically insulated from the cartridge case base.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

In an ammunition data link in accordance with the invention data transmission is isolated from the weapon s firing circuit thereby reducing line noise and the risk of unintended firing of the cartridge. The ammunition data link is bi directional. The ammunition data link can transmit and receive data including built in test data to and from the projectile within an allocated time to support the weapon s firing rate while providing the initial power to the cartridge s data link circuit. The ammunition data link case base can also be used to upload upgraded software and perform diagnostics at the storage facility or on the vehicle. The ammunition data link case base can withstand gun chamber pressures in excess of 105 kpsi without any gas leakage. The ammunition data link case base can survive user and autoloader handling and can be extracted with forces equal to standard case bases.

A first data pin is electrically connected to the first conductive ring and extends into an interior of the cartridge case base . Similarly a second data pin is electrically connected to the second conductive ring and extends into the interior of the cartridge case base . Data pins are electrically isolated from the case base . The ends of the data pins in the interior of the case base connect with wiring not shown to the projectile in the interior .

The cartridge is loaded into a gun for firing. The breech of the gun includes a pair of electrically conductive pins not shown that are spaced so that one pin contacts the ring and the other pin contacts the ring . Because the rings are complete circles the cartridge may be loaded in any angular orientation and the breech pins will always contact the respective rings . The breech pins are connected to the gun s fire control system. Data and or power is transmitted through the breech pins to the respective rings and then to respective data pins and then to the electronic system of the cartridge . Data may also be sent from the electronic system of the cartridge to the fire control system.

In the isolator or insulation material is shown adjacent primer . In another embodiment shown in an annular ring of the case base material is left intact adjacent the primer . The annular recess is formed radially outward of the annular ring . The embodiment of provides more mechanical strength in the case base because the annular recess is not directly adjacent the opening for the primer .

The rings and isolator or insulation material may be formed in the manner of a circuit board. The circuit board may then be disposed in the annular recess and fastened therein by for example a press fit glue epoxy threaded fasteners etc.

The case base and the interior side of the isolator or insulation material have openings in which the data pins are disposed. Data pins may take a variety of forms as long as they can transmit electrical signals and are electrically insulated from the case base .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
