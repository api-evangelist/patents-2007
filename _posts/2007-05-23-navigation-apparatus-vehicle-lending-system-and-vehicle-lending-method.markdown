The present invention relates to a navigation apparatus installed in a vehicle and also to a vehicle lending system for lending a vehicle provided with a navigation apparatus and a method for lending such a vehicle.

In an ordinary vehicle navigation apparatus when search conditions for a destination or waypoint for example a name or address are input setting of the end point of a guidance path or route is performed by referring to a database related to various facilities sightseeing sites and the like. Then a path search is performed a guidance path from the present location of the vehicle to the end point is determined and a guidance screen for guiding the vehicle along the determined guidance path is displayed based on map data. The guidance screen includes a map in which the present location of the vehicle the guidance path and the like are indicated and is appropriately updated in response to vehicle movement.

The map data and the database are recorded on a recording medium such as a DVD a hard disk or the like. Due to a change in road conditions an increase or decrease in facilities or the like it becomes necessary to update the map data and the database in order for the navigation apparatus to operate effectively. With respect to easily updating map data and the like for example in JP 2001 108451A a navigation apparatus is disclosed that via the internet communicates with a server apparatus that manages map data and supplemental information. This navigation apparatus records the map data and the supplemental information obtained from the server apparatus to a nonvolatile memory such as a flash memory.

A user that uses a rental car for sightseeing or business often drives the rental car in an area the user does not know well. Installation of a navigation apparatus in a rental car is very productive for realizing convenient driving for such a user. For example in JP 2002 99961A a car rental system including a navigation apparatus capable of connection to a network a hotel terminal and a rental car vendor terminal connected to the network is disclosed. In this system the user accesses the hotel terminal via the network to make a hotel reservation. After receiving notification of that reservation from the hotel terminal the rental car vendor terminal makes settings in the navigation apparatus via the network such as a guidance path from the location of the rental car vendor and an area in which movement is possible.

At present many types of navigation apparatuses exist and operating procedures the form of screens displayed during operation the arrangement and shape of operating keys and the like differ according to the type of navigation apparatus. In most cases a user who has borrowed a rental car equipped with a navigation apparatus from a rental car vendor likely uses a navigation apparatus of a type they have not yet used not a navigation apparatus installed in a vehicle that they themselves own. Also a user who has borrowed a rental car equipped with a navigation apparatus may not have experience using a navigation apparatus.

In the above sort of case the user operates the navigation apparatus installed in the rental car with reference to a user s manual to perform setting of their desired destination or the like. However this sort of activity is very burdensome to a user of a rental car engaged in sightseeing or business for limited time. The rental car vendor may make settings in the navigation apparatus before the user departs but this is meaningless when the destination has been changed or when the rental car is rented for a long period of time.

In the car rental system described in JP 2002 99961A the guidance path sent from the server apparatus is set in the navigation apparatus so the burden on the user with respect to operation is likely reduced. However in this sort of system the burden of operation is lightened only in a case in which the user travels from the rental car vendor s store to the destination without taking any detours.

In a case in which the hotel in which the user will stay is the final destination even if a guidance path from the rental car vendor s store to the hotel is provided a guidance path directed directly to the destination is nearly meaningless to a user that uses the rental car for business or sightseeing. Even assuming that the guidance path has been set in consideration of waypoints that the user has designated in advance when the vehicle has deviated from the guidance path for the user to have meals perform fueling or the like circumstances can arise in which it is more effective to newly search for a guidance path using the present location of the vehicle as a start point than to return to the original guidance path. Circumstances can also arise in which the user s plans are changed due to the schedule of a business counterpart or conditions at a sightseeing site so that the user does not travel to the waypoints as designated. Unforeseen circumstances can also arise in which a fellow passenger suddenly becomes ill and the user drives the vehicle toward a hospital that is not designated as a waypoint. Thus it is thought that even when using the car rental system described in JP 2002 99961A the burden of operating a navigation apparatus is not reduced for an ordinary user using a rental car for business or sightseeing.

The present invention was made in order to address the problems described above and it is an object thereof to in a navigation apparatus installed in a vehicle such as a rental car used by the general pubic greatly reduce the burden on a user and in particular to reduce the burden on a user when setting the end point of a guidance path.

The invention provides a navigation apparatus comprising a display portion that displays a guidance screen and a removably installed recording medium the navigation apparatus being provided in a vehicle and guiding the vehicle along a guidance path wherein when candidate site data created by an external apparatus is stored on the recording medium a screen for selectively setting an end point of the guidance path is displayed in the display portion based on the candidate site data when the end point is set a guidance path that arrives at the end point is calculated and the candidate site data includes information related to one or a plurality of locations that are designated in advance before the recording medium is installed and the end point is selected from the one or a plurality of locations.

In the navigation apparatus of the invention it is preferable that the candidate site data is created in the external apparatus by searching for content stored in a database related to locations using as conditions one or a plurality of items that are input to a terminal communicably connected to the external apparatus and designate the one or a plurality of locations.

In the navigation apparatus of the invention it is preferable that the external apparatus is capable of transmitting the candidate site data to a terminal that is communicably connected to the external apparatus the recording medium being removably installed in the terminal and the candidate site data is stored on the recording medium using this terminal.

In the navigation apparatus of the invention it is preferable that the candidate site data further includes information related to one or a plurality of related locations that satisfy a predetermined positional relationship with the one or a plurality of locations and the end point is selected from the one or a plurality of locations and the one or a plurality of related locations.

In the navigation apparatus of the invention it is preferable that the candidate site data includes information related to a classification for each of the one or a plurality of related locations and in the display portion the one or a plurality of related locations are shown differentiated according to those classifications.

The invention provides a vehicle lending system including a user terminal used by a user that desires lending of a vehicle a server apparatus that receives an application for lending of the vehicle sent from the user terminal a store terminal disposed in a store that will lend the vehicle and a navigation apparatus installed in the vehicle the user terminal and the server apparatus being communicably connected to each other the server apparatus and the store terminal being communicably connected to each other and a recording medium being removably installed in the store terminal and the navigation apparatus wherein the user terminal transmits to the server apparatus in addition to the application for lending of the vehicle one or a plurality of items input to the user terminal and related to one or a plurality of locations the server apparatus creates candidate site data that the navigation apparatus refers to in order to identify the one or a plurality of locations based on the one or a plurality of items and transmits the candidate site data to the store terminal and the navigation apparatus when the recording medium in a state storing the candidate site data has been installed displays a screen for selectively setting an end point of a guidance path from the one or a plurality of locations.

The invention provides a vehicle lending method of lending a vehicle in which a navigation apparatus has been installed to a user the method including a step of receiving an application for lending of the vehicle sent from a terminal the application received in a server apparatus communicably connected to the terminal a step of when the server apparatus has received in addition to the application one or a plurality of items input to the user terminal and related to one or a plurality of locations creating candidate site data that the navigation apparatus refers to in order to identify the one or a plurality of locations based on the one or a plurality of items the candidate site data being created in the server apparatus a step of transmitting the candidate site data created in the server apparatus to a terminal disposed in a store where the vehicle will be lent and communicably connected to the server apparatus a step of storing the candidate site data received by the store terminal in the navigation apparatus and a step of allowing the user to in the navigation apparatus selectively set an end point of a guidance path from the one or a plurality of locations based on the candidate site data.

In the vehicle lending system and the vehicle lending method of the invention it is preferable that the server apparatus obtains one or a plurality of related locations that satisfy a predetermined positional relationship with the one or a plurality of locations and creates the candidate site data so as to include the one or a plurality of related locations in addition to the one or a plurality of locations and in the navigation apparatus the end point is selected from the one or a plurality of locations and the one or a plurality of related locations.

According to the invention when for example an application for lending of a vehicle is made using the Internet or the like the user is allowed to designate in advance locations such as a destination or waypoints and by providing information of these locations that become candidates for the end point of a guidance path to the navigation apparatus the user can easily and promptly select the end point of the guidance path by selecting from these locations. Even if the user does not have experience using the navigation apparatus installed in the vehicle the user can use the navigation apparatus without referring to a manual or the like. Also by allowing the navigation apparatus to possess information related to one or a plurality of related locations that satisfy a predetermined positional relationship with one or a plurality of locations that have been designated it is possible to simply set a related location such as a sightseeing site a restaurant a hospital or a gasoline station near a destination or a waypoint as the end point of the guidance path. Further by displaying the related locations differentiated according to their classification the user can quickly find facilities sightseeing sites or the like according to the user s purpose.

Also with the invention based on items that the user has input to a terminal in order to designate a location such as a destination an external apparatus more specifically a server apparatus creates candidate site data and so the amount of data possessed by the navigation apparatus for searching for a destination or the like is reduced.

Hereinafter an example of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. is an explanatory diagram showing an overview of a vehicle lending system that is an embodiment of the invention. The vehicle lending system includes a user terminal used by a user that borrows a rental car a server apparatus that is managed by a rental car vendor and receives rental car lending reservations for a plurality of stores deployed by a rental car vendor and a store terminal disposed at each of these stores. The user terminal the server apparatus and the store terminal are connected to a communications network that has been configured using the Internet a LAN a telephone network or the like and are capable of communicating with each other. The form of the communications network is not particularly limited as long as the object of the invention is attainable for example the user terminal and the server apparatus may be connected using the Internet a telephone network and the like and the server apparatus and the store terminal connected with a dedicated line. Also the user terminal and the store terminal may be incapable of communicating with each other. In one user terminal and one store terminal are shown but the number of the user terminals and the number of the store terminals are not particularly limited and ordinarily it is likely that many of the terminals and are present.

A user that makes a rental car reservation with a rental car vendor accesses the server apparatus using the user terminal and applies for lending of a vehicle by designating essential items such as the date and time store and vehicle type the user terminal may also be operated not by the user but by a person related to the user for example a member of the user s family . When making the application in addition to these essential items the user can input location information related to a destination waypoints or the like. Here the destination is the location to which the user plans to go using the rental car and the waypoints include locations that the user plans to visit in the course of arriving at the destination. The server apparatus receives the application of the user and manages the reservation and notifies the store terminal of a store possessing a rental car borrowed by the user that a reservation was made. A recording medium on which map data has been stored is removably installed in a navigation apparatus installed in the rental car . The navigation apparatus becomes operable by at the store the user that has reserved the rental car receiving the recording medium and installing it in the navigation apparatus .

When the location information has been input the server apparatus specifies locations based on the location information and further performs processing that selects locations related to the specified locations. The results of processing are transmitted to the store terminal along with the reservation notification as user data. In the store terminal the recording medium is removably installable and the user data received is stored by the recording medium in the store terminal . By way of example a memory card employing a rewritable nonvolatile semiconductor memory for example an SD card registered trademark is used for the recording medium . By referring to the user data of the recording medium setting of the end point of the guidance path is performed with a very simple operation in the navigation apparatus . This is described in detail below.

The server apparatus is further provided with a reservation information database and a location information database . Stored in the reservation information database is store information related to each store of the rental car vendor such as store name and address information about rental cars in the possession of each store information about the reservation status and usage status of these rental cars and various information related to reservations that the rental car vendor has presently received. The location information database is referred to when the user data is created by the reservation program . Stored in the location information database is information related to sightseeing sites including sightseeing facilities public facilities for example hospitals and police stations hotels restaurants gasoline stations and other facilities including position latitude and longitude name and address.

The map data is data used in the navigation apparatus and is always recorded in the recording portion and on the recording medium . For example when the map data of the recording medium is updated or has been corrupted the map data of the recording portion of the store terminal is copied to the recording medium .

It is possible that a customer that has not made a reservation will visit the store and desire reservation or lending of a rental car. In this case the operator of the store terminal accesses the server apparatus from the store terminal by running the Web browser and makes arrangements for a reservation or lending by designating the date and time store vehicle type and the like and also the location information. That is the store terminal can function in the same manner as the user terminal .

The user can also make a rental car reservation and designate location information via a telephone. A telephone operator terminal having a configuration like the user terminal is connected to the communications network . Via telephone a user informs a telephone operator of a date and time store vehicle type location information and the like and these are input to the telephone operator terminal by the telephone operator and sent to the server apparatus . When the size of the rental car vendor is small a server apparatus and a store terminal connected to each other via a LAN may be disposed together in the store.

A slot in which the recording medium is removably installed is provided in the navigation apparatus . The map data stored on the recording medium includes node and link information that describes roads information related to various facilities included in a physical range that is the subject of the map data and other map information. The map data is used when for example the CPU executes a path search or when the rendering portion creates guidance screen image data.

The user data includes reservation data that includes items related to the reservation such as a user name and reservation number. Further the user data includes candidate site data related to one or a plurality of locations designated by the user specifically a destination and or waypoints and locations that satisfy a predetermined positional relationship with the designated locations for example facilities or sightseeing sites . When the user did not designate either a destination or a waypoint when making the reservation the candidate site data is not included in the user data . When the user installs the recording medium in the navigation apparatus and presses the power key the presence or absence of the candidate site data is judged. When the candidate site data is present the navigation apparatus operates in a user dedicated mode and setting of the end point of the guidance path is simply performed by referring to the candidate site data .

Following is a detailed description of rental car lending using the vehicle lending system in this embodiment. is a sequence diagram showing processing performed between the user terminal and the server apparatus regarding a reservation of a rental car. Communications between the user terminal and the server apparatus are for example performed based on the HTTP protocol and thus a request to acquire an HTML file for a rental car reservation inquiry page is transmitted from the user terminal to the server apparatus S . The server program is run in the server apparatus and thus the server apparatus specifies the HTML file of the rental car reservation inquiry page based on a URL Uniform Resource Locator indicated in the received acquisition request and reads that HTML file from the recording portion and transmits it to the user terminal S .

The CPU of the server apparatus is executing the reservation program . When the server apparatus receives reservation conditions from the usage terminal the server apparatus refers to the reservation information database and judges whether or not a reservation is possible with the reservation conditions designated by the user S and when a reservation is possible an HTML file for a user information input page is transmitted to the user terminal from the server apparatus S . When a reservation is not possible an HTML file for a rental car reservation inquiry page with an additional character string that indicates that a reservation was not possible is again transmitted to the user terminal return to Step S .

When the server apparatus receives the user information the server apparatus stores the reservation conditions and the user information in the reservation information database with a reservation number attached thus recording the user s reservation in the reservation information database S . Afterward in the server apparatus an HTML file is created for a reservation complete notification page that indicates a reservation number along with the reservation conditions and the user information and transmitted to the user terminal S . shows an example of a reservation complete notification page. In the example reservation complete notification page shown along with the reservation number 01234 the reservation conditions and user information shown in are written. Provided in the reservation complete notification page are an end key lower left of that transmits an end request communication between the user terminal and the server apparatus and a transmit key lower right of labeled SET LOCATION INFORMATION . When the transmit key of the reservation complete notification page is pressed a request for acquisition of an HTML file for a location information input page is transmitted to the server apparatus S . Also when the end key is pressed an end request is transmitted to the server apparatus and processing performed in the user terminal related to the rental car reservation ends.

When the server apparatus receives the request for acquisition of the HTML file for the location information input page that HTML file is transmitted to the user terminal S . shows an example of the location information input page. In the location information input page a plurality of text boxes and selection boxes are provided so that it is possible to input a name address or telephone number for the destination to which the user plans to go by driving the rental car and a plurality of waypoints the user plans to visit before arriving at the destination. It is sufficient if at least one item is input for one location destination or waypoint but a plurality of items may also be input. In the example shown in DEF HOTEL is input as the name of the destination GHI LAND is input as the name of a first waypoint 03 1111 2222 is input as the telephone number of a second waypoint and 1 KASUMIGASEKI CHIYODA KU TOKYO is input as the address of the third waypoint. It is not necessary to perform input for all of the destination and the first to third waypoints for example input may be performed for only the destination or only the first waypoint. In the invention the number of destinations and waypoints that can be designated is not particularly limited for example a location information input page in which a plurality of destination can be designated may be created.

When the transmit key of the location information input page is pressed the location information that has been input in the location information input page is transmitted to the server apparatus S . The server apparatus stores the received location information in the reservation information database and executes a search process that searches in the location information database for locations corresponding to the designated destination and or waypoints by using the location information as search conditions S . In Step S further locations that satisfy a predetermined positional relationship with the destination or waypoints are set by using the location information database and the map data .

When judged in Step S that an item related to the destination is not included in the location information or after Step S the server apparatus judges whether or not an item related to a waypoint is included in the location information S . When an item related to a waypoint is included using the designated item related to the waypoint as a search condition a location matching that condition is identified by performing a search for the location information database S . Step S is performed for all of the waypoints for which a search condition has been provided. When there are a plurality of input items for one waypoint a search is performed for each input item.

After Step S a judgment is performed of whether or not effective search results have been obtained S . For example when the item input by the user is inappropriate and none of the corresponding locations are present in the location information database effective search results are not obtained. In this case the process ends. When effective search results have been obtained i.e. when at least one location has been identified in Steps S and S related locations that satisfy a predetermined positional relationship with respect to the identified locations are selected using the map data and the location information database stored in the recording portion S .

In the destination is indicated with a black circle and the waypoints are indicated with black squares and diagonal lines are drawn in the sections to which these belong. Also the locations recorded in the location information database in these sections and the sections adjacent thereto are indicated with white circles. In the store where the user will borrow the rental car is indicated with a black triangle and diagonal lines are also added to the section to which it belongs. In Step S it is preferable that in addition to the locations with relation to the destination and the waypoints locations in the section to which this store belongs and the sections adjacent thereto are selected as related locations. In Step S the positional relationship for selecting related locations is not particularly limited the related locations may be selected using a method other than the one described above. For example locations in a circle of a predetermined radius including the destination and the waypoints may be selected as related locations or locations in a circle of a predetermined radius including the store which will lend out the rental car may be selected as related locations. Also it is possible to search for a path from the store to the destination via the waypoints and set locations existing near the path as related locations.

In this embodiment in Step S a process is also performed that selects a related location that satisfies a predetermined condition for an item of the location information database from the related locations that have been selected in the manner described above. Taking the location information database shown in as an example related locations whose category is SIGHTSEEING related locations related to emergency facilities whose category is ROAD SERVICE HOSPITAL GASOLINE STATION TOILET POLICE or the like and related locations whose AFFILIATION is YES and whose category is RESTAURANT GASOLINE STATION PARKING LOT HOTEL SHOPPING or the like are ultimately selected.

Again referring to after Step S the server apparatus creates the user data based on the recorded matters in the databases and and the results of Step S and then transmits the created user data to a target store terminal along with a notification indicating that a reservation has been made S .

The user data includes the reservation data and the candidate site data . The reservation data is created based on the reservation information database and is data related to the user s name reservation number and the like. The candidate site data includes matters except for image file and audio file paths recorded in the location information database such as the latitude longitude and name for the destination and or waypoints identified in Step S and or S in . Further when Step S in has been performed the candidate site data also includes matters except for image file and audio file paths recorded in the location information database such as the latitude longitude name and the like for one or a plurality of related locations that have been ultimately selected. Further it is preferable that the candidate site data includes matters related to the latitude longitude name and the like of a store that can be the site for returning the rental car for example these matters are identified according to the store information present in the reservation information database .

When the path of an image file or an audio file is recorded in the location information database for an identified destination waypoint or related location the server apparatus reads the image file or audio file stored in the recording portion based on the recorded items of the location information database and adds the read file to the user data . It is preferable that a specification unique to the navigation apparatus is used as the data format of the user data so that the user data cannot be used in a navigation apparatus of a different manufacturer.

The server apparatus and the store terminal for example communicate based on the FTP protocol and along with notifying the store having the store terminal of the fact that a reservation has been made the user data sent from the server apparatus is stored in the recording portion of the store terminal . When the user that made the reservation visits the store the operator of the store terminal installs the recording medium in the store terminal stores the user data in the recording portion on the recording medium and gives the recording medium on which the user data has been stored to the user. The user installs the received recording medium in the navigation apparatus of the rental car that the user will drive.

When the end key in the reservation complete notification page shown in is pressed and location information is not input the server apparatus creates only the reservation data based on the reservation information database after receiving a request to end communications between the user terminal and the server apparatus from the user terminal . Then the server apparatus transmits user data that does not include the candidate site data along with a notification that a reservation has been made to a target store terminal Step S in .
