This application claims benefit of Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 779 128 filed 04 Mar. 2006.

The present invention relates to improved materials and configurations for use in the manufacturing of medical devices such as expandable intraluminal stents grafts stent grafts surgical fabrics suppositories transdermal patches or oral medications that optionally deliver active ingredients within a living body.

The prior art describes a variety of grafts that are used for the replacement of diseased passageways in a living body. In addition the prior art teaches several metallic reinforcements used for stenting to hold open constricted passageways in a living body. Moreover there exists in the prior art stent grafts which are generally a combination of these two separate components which are commonly used to repair aneurismal vessels.

The prior art includes grafts manufactured of materials such a textiles polytetrafluoroethylene expanded polytetrafluoroethylene platinum and gold. Due to the limitations of the materials employed these prior art grafts have relatively large wall thicknesses that limit the bore size in cylindrical embodiments which results in a restriction or a pressure drop as contents such as blood flow through the graft. The heavy wall thickness also increases the possibility of the living body rejecting the foreign graft. Furthermore the prior art expanded polytetrafluoroethylene materials have inferior physical properties such as strength and abrasion resistance which are important properties for safe installation and providing long service life. In particular the prior art grafts offer significant room for improvement in suture retention and tear resistance. These prior art grafts also require the use of a separate component to hold open the bore of cylindrical shaped grafts. Exemplary patents of grafts include U.S. Pat. No. 6 025 044 to Campbell 2000 U.S. Pat. No. 6 038 484 to House 2000 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 517 571 to Brauker 2003 . Exemplary patents for producing expanded polytetrafluoroethylene include U.S. Pat. No. 3 953 566 to Gore 1976 U.S. Pat. No. 3 962 153 to Gore 1976 U.S. Pat. No. 4 096 227 to Gore 1978 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 197 390 to Gore 1980 .

The prior art reinforcements used for stenting are typically manufactured completely of materials such as stainless steel tantalum and nickel titanium alloys. These stents are usually transported to the location of installation in a reduced size where they are subsequently dilated to come into contact with the interior surface of the passageway in which they are being installed. Despite attempts to make stents more flexible through the use of a large variety of configurations the reinforcements used for stenting made of these prior art materials are sometimes difficult to install in small or curved passageways. In addition due to size limitations a surgeon normally needs over two stents on average to complete a stenting procedure. Furthermore the reinforcements used for stenting are generally of the uniform thickness from first end to second end which creates a stress concentration at the notch between the passageway in which it is installed and the end of the stent. This stress concentration can result in failure of fragile passageways such as human arteries or veins. Exemplary patents of metallic reinforcements used for stenting include U.S. Pat. No. 4 739 762 to Palmaz 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 5 102 417 to Palmaz 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 449 373 to Pinchasik 1995 U.S. Pat. No. 5 972 018 to Israel 1999 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 884 260 to Kugler 2005 .

In the prior art there are also grafts and stents which include bioactive materials. Coated medical devices have experienced problems with the coating flaking off or causing the recipient to have an allergic reaction when in vivo. Pathologists have also found that drug eluting metallic stents have problems with delayed healing so that the endothelial layer of cells that would normally cover the members of the stent was non existent or uneven thereby resulting in thrombosis which resulted in patient death. It was unexpected that the present invention provides potential for a more consistent and even growth of the endothelial layer of cells by providing a more accurate and controlled release of active ingredients over time.

The prior art drug eluting stents also require a longer term antiplatelet therapy than bare metal stents. Since the surfaces of the bare metal stents are thrombogenic the drug eluting stents are designed to inhibit or slow cell growth in an attempt to eliminate restenosis. The active ingredients included in the drug eluting stents however require that the patients be given an antiplatelet therapy for a longer period of time while the artery heals and a thin layer of endothelial cells grows over the members of the stent to reduce the risk of thrombus. Due to this phenomenon the Federal Drug Administration FDA recommends that the period of therapy be increased from 6 weeks for bare metal stents to 3 6 months for use with drug eluting stents and in some cases doctors prescribe some medications for longer periods of time such as for life. This therapy adds substantial daily expense for the patient and in many cases the patients are allergic to the medications and they cause the patients to have unwanted side effects like illness and a higher risk of uncontrolled bleeding during future surgical procedures.

There is also a significant problem of attaching active ingredients to the prior art medical devices like grafts and stent grafts that have polymeric surfaces. It was surprising how significant of an improvement of adhesion of active ingredients and coatings could be achieved to the medical devices comprised of polymers in the present invention by including additives in the polymers. This improvement was especially noticeable when the additives partially or fully protruded from the surface of the polymer because the additives appear to mechanically lock the active ingredients coating or combinations thereof to the polymeric surface.

The prior art drug delivery mechanisms also can also provide the patient with imprecise drug dosage and modified release characteristics especially when employed over long periods of time. For drug eluting stents the imprecision of the dosage is related to the difficulty of evenly dispersing active ingredients in coatings obtaining a uniform dry coating film on partially vertical surfaces like those found on stents and inconsistent delivery related to poor adhesion of coating to the stent s surface. Furthermore for a graft the imprecision is primarily related to the heterogeneous structure of the prior art materials like found in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and the poor adhesion to polymeric surfaces. The highly uniform structure of the expanded material of the present invention and the improved adhesion enables a significant improvement in the precision of active ingredient delivery over time. Moreover the active ingredients showed potential to significantly improve patency by positioning the active ingredients between layers of expanded material instead of on the surface or in coatings on surface.

Due to the high shear stress that develops during bending of a stent graft while sliding it through the torturous path of the human anatomy there is a significant risk in the prior art stent grafts that the graft will tear at the connection points between the stent and graft. This risk is increased as the wall thickness of the graft is reduced. It is highly beneficial to patient safety to increase the graft wall strength and to minimize the wall thickness of the graft to minimize pressure drop through the graft and to enable the use of grafts in smaller sizes. If the graft separates from the stent there is risk the graft will collapse causing a restriction in flow or worse yet a life threatening leak. In the prior art there are attempts to reduce tearing by modifying the mechanical design of the connections but this often results in a larger than necessary wall thickness that causes unnecessary restrictions in flow or lack of flexibility of the stent graft. In the present invention there are tear arresting additives which enable thinner wall thicknesses without tearing regardless of mechanical design.

The large wall thicknesses of the prior art grafts comprised of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene employ paste extrusion techniques using relatively large particle size raw materials. The fine powder polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE of the prior art such as Asahi Glass Co. Fluon CD 123 has an average particle size of about 475 microns Asahi Glass Co. Fluon CD 1 has an average particle size of about 550 microns Dupont 601A has an average particle size of about 570 microns and Dupont 610A has an average particle size of about 470 microns. It was surprising to discover in the present invention that potential exists for thinner wall thicknesses by using smaller particle size polytetrafluoroethylene raw materials. Moreover these wall thicknesses could be substantially more durable and have increased adhesion characteristics by including additives and nano size articles.

The present invention addresses the aforementioned limitations of the prior art by providing a novel material that is suitable for use in a prosthesis deployed in a living body that is incrementally expandable from a first size to a second size through deformation or self expansion a prosthesis that is substantially more flexible and capable of conforming to the natural curvatures of passageways in a living body when installed using for example noninvasive surgery techniques such as those employing a catheter or a balloon catheter a prosthesis that can have a variable wall thickness to reduce creating a stress concentration between the prosthesis and the passageway in which it is installed a prosthesis that has minimal drag against the interior wall of a passageway in a body when inserted through the passageway a prosthesis material and manufacturing process that enables the production of very small sizes and a large variety of sizes so that surgeons can for example repair very small blood vessels and use less prostheses per procedure a prosthesis having a relatively thin wall thickness that substantially increases the size of the bore in tubular embodiments increasing flow and reducing pressure drop a prosthesis that is self expanding from a first size to a second size that undergoes relaxation to manage the outward radial pressure applied to a supporting passageway such as blood carrying artery a prosthesis that more accurately delivers the dosage of active ingredients like drugs with or without a coating especially over long periods of time a prosthesis that includes surface treatments additives or combinations thereof that substantially minimizes the risk of coatings or active ingredients from flaking off the surface of the prosthesis and can sometimes assist in maintaining the original position of the prosthesis after deployment and a prosthesis that can include biological cells grown in vivo or vitro that can be implanted into a body as for example a blood carrying vessel or organ to replace unrepairable portions of the anatomy.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved material reinforcement or combination thereof for use in medical applications.

One more object of the present invention is to provide an improved material reinforcement or combination thereof that has improved performance in stents grafts stent grafts bifurcated stents bifurcated grafts bifurcated stent grafts sutures hernia patches oral grafts drug delivery devices surgical fabrics cosmetic surgery materials oncology treatments dental floss implants filters joint replacement or repair shunts wound care oral tablets oral capsules suppositories or transdermal patches.

Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a drug delivery system that is capable of substantially more precisely delivering active ingredients over relatively long periods of time.

An additional object of the present invention is to provide an active ingredient delivery system that improves the healing process and substantially more consistently enables the endothelial layer of cells to line a stent graft or stent graft and to minimize the length of time of antiplatelet therapy after installation.

One more object of the present invention is to provide an improved material in configurations selected from the group of tubular sheet fiber woven nonwoven or combinations thereof.

A further object of the present invention is to provide a reinforcement material suitable for stenting that has improved flexibility a less complex manufacturing process a wall thickness of varying thickness to reduce stress concentrations at the juncture between the stent and the passageway in which it is installed and an ability to be easily produced in a large variety of sizes so that less stents are required by procedure.

It is one more object of the present invention to provide a scaffold for growing living cells so that lab grown blood vessels and organs can be manufactured if a synthetic prosthesis is not a viable replacement for damaged or diseased vessels or organs.

These figures merely schematically illustrate the invention and are not intended to indicate relative size and dimensions of actual product or manufacturing systems or components thereof.

While the present invention will hereinafter be described in connection with the preferred embodiments and methods of use thereof it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments and methods of use. Instead it is intended to cover all alternatives modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.

The present invention includes an expanded material a reinforcement or combinations thereof that are optionally installed with a supporting member . The individual components or combinations thereof optionally further include a covering additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. The additives and nano size articles are optionally partially or fully one or more active or inactive ingredients that are delivered to the surroundings.

The expanded material of the present invention is comprised of an outside surface an inside surface a first end a second end and at least one layer of a wall thickness . The expanded material is obtained by at least partially stretching the material . The structure of the expanded material is optionally made substantially permanent or locked in after stretching by thermal treatment. The expanded material preferably has a uniform structure that is optionally obtained by at least partially stretching the material in the circumferential direction.

The expanded material can be in any configuration but it is generally in the form of an expanded tubular profile an expanded sheet or an expanded fiber .

A typical embodiment of the expanded tubular profile is shown in in isometric view. It is comprised of the outside surface the inside surface a bore the first end the second end and at least one layer of the wall thickness . The wall thickness is partially or fully comprised of the expanded material . The bore optionally includes one or more contents . The structure of the wall thickness of the expanded material can be designed to partially or fully contain the contents such as those in the bore .

As shown in the expanded tubular profile optionally includes at least one slit that is opened to convert the expanded tubular profile into the expanded sheet as shown in . The expanded sheet of the present invention is any sheet film membrane thin layer skin or anything that is thin in comparison to its length and width. The expanded sheet is comprised of the outside surface the inside surface not shown the first end the second end a third end a fourth end and at least one layer of the wall thickness . The wall thickness is partially or fully comprised of the expanded material .

The expanded sheet is preferably produced by slitting the expanded tubular profile . However the expanded sheet can also be made in sheet or film configuration but this generally produces a less uniform product when stretched. Producing the expanded sheet from the expanded tubular profile produces a much more uniform product having a substantially more uniform structure across its entire width when compared to an expanded sheet stretched in sheet configuration. An expanded sheet manufactured from an expanded tubular profile also significantly reduces wasted material when compared to expanded sheet stretched in sheet configuration because the heterogeneous damaged unstretched or combinations thereof portions found in the prior art near the ends and do not have to be trimmed off. The manufacturing process of the present invention also consumes significantly less energy when compared to the prior art.

The expanded fiber is preferably produced by slitting one or more layers of the expanded sheet into relatively narrow strips of any size. However the expanded fiber can also be made in filament rod or tape configurations but this generally produces a less uniform product when stretched and the material can only be stretched in one direction. The expanded sheet optionally includes a plurality of additional slits that convert the expanded sheet into the expanded fiber as shown in . The expanded fiber is generally comprised of the outside surface the inside surface the first end the second end the third end not shown the fourth end and at least one layer of the wall thickness . The wall thickness is partially or fully comprised of the expanded material . The expanded fiber is alternatively produced of a small diameter expanded tubular profile or a flattened small diameter expanded tubular profile . These expanded fibers can also be subsequently transformed into other articles such as yams sutures fabrics ropes braided rods threads casings etc. The expanded fiber of the present invention can also be subsequently chopped into shorter fibers and for example converted into felts papers nonwovens etc.

The expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet expanded fiber or combinations thereof optionally includes a supporting member a connecting material a reinforcement or combinations thereof. The supporting member reinforcement or combinations thereof are positioned either on or near the outside surface inside surface or combinations thereof. The reinforcement is alternatively positioned within the wall thickness between two wall thicknesses or between wall thicknesses comprised of two or more layers of the expanded material . The connecting material is optionally positioned between two or more layers of the expanded material between two or more wall thicknesses between the expanded material and the reinforcement between the reinforcement and the supporting member between the expanded material and the supporting member or combinations thereof. An embodiment of one of the possible combinations in tubular configuration is shown in in exploded isometric view.

The supporting member is a host or passageway that works in cooperation with or receives the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. The optional connecting material partially or fully attaches the expanded material to another layer of the expanded material a wall thicknesses the supporting member the reinforcement or combinations thereof. The connection is either permanent or temporary. The connecting material can also optionally partially or fully attach the reinforcement to the supporting member . The reinforcement for example provides additional strength support structure shape shape recovery size recovery shape memory size memory or combinations thereof to the expanded material . The reinforcement can also be used independently to for example hold open a constricted supporting member .

As an example is shown in in cross sectional end view the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile is optionally reduced in size by including one or more folds in the wall thickness of the expanded material . The fold for example is a wall thickness that is bent over intertwined or doubled up so that at least one part lies on another part. The fold temporarily or permanently stores an extra wall thickness . The fold can be optionally partially or fully tacked down with for example an adhesive material or other means to keep the fold at least temporarily positioned. As illustrated in in cross sectional end view the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile can be unfolded up to its original size or larger. Alternatively as shown in the optional folds are obtained by temporarily or permanently pleating the wall thickness . The optional pleats can be of uniform or varying size and shape. The pleats can be oriented around the circumference as shown in to for example reduce the diameter the pleats can be oriented longitudinally not shown to for example reduce its length or combinations thereof.

As shown if the size and shape of the expanded material such as in the form of the expanded tubular profile can be optionally retained when in first size and shape or in second size and shape by use a plurality of deformable elements when they are included in the material between layers of expanded material within the wall thickness on the inside surface on the outside surface or combinations thereof. The preferred deformable elements that provide this functionality for example enable the expanded material to be self expandable formable deformable or combinations thereof in a way that the second size and shape is substantially retained after installation. The expanded material for instance can be maintained in a reduced size and shape by the plurality of deformable elements and subsequently maintained in a larger second size and shape after dilation by the plurality of deformable elements . The expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile also optionally includes one or more thru holes in the wall thickness as also shown in to form a perforated tubular profile . The thru holes can be of any size and shape such as the examples schematically shown in . The size and shape of the thru holes can be uniform or varying within an embodiment. Likewise the remaining expanded material left between the thru holes can be of any shape or pattern that provides the functionality described herein.

The structure of the expanded material that comprises the wall thickness is either solid or porous. A solid structure as shown in is comprised substantially of the material . A porous structure as shown in is comprised of the material that includes one or a plurality of voids . The void is an open space or gap in the material . Although it is shown differently in it is preferred that the voids be substantially uniform in size and distribution. A porous wall thickness can be partially or fully permeable or impermeable to gases liquids or combinations thereof.

As shown in which are schematic illustrations of the structure of the expanded material in top plan view under magnification the porous structure optionally includes one or a plurality of voids nodes axial fibrils circumferential fibrils angled fibrils bent fibrils or combinations thereof. The fibrils can be substantially straight or they can include curves bends or other non straight forms. The fibrils voids and nodes are sometimes created during the stretching of the material . Under some manufacturing conditions as schematically shown in it is possible to have a node free porous structure that is comprised of the axial fibrils circumferential fibrils angled fibrils bent fibrils voids or combinations thereof. The structure including a plurality of fibrils can have a web like appearance under magnification.

As schematically illustrated in the axial fibrils which are substantially oriented in the axial direction are generally created by stretching the material in the axial direction. As schematically shown in the circumferential fibrils which are substantially oriented in the circumferential direction are generally created by stretching the material in the circumferential direction. As shown in the angled fibrils are generally formed by stretching the material in the axial and circumferential direction concurrently. The expanded material that partially or fully contains bent fibrils is generally more stretchable than the expanded material comprised of mostly or totally unbent fibrils. As shown in the bent fibrils are usually formed by stretching the material and allowing it to at least partially shrink back to about its original size before partially or fully locking in the structure with for example thermal treatment. As schematically shown in the length of the fibrils can be customized by for example modifying the amount of stretching in the axial or circumferential direction.

As an example is schematically illustrated in which is a cross sectional view of the expanded material the wall thickness of the porous structure is generally comprised of one or more partial or full rows of voids nodes fibrils such as or combinations thereof. The rows and columns of voids nodes fibrils such as or combinations thereof can be arranged randomly but it is preferred that they are organized in a somewhat repeating pattern.

As an example is schematically illustrated in which are illustrations of the expanded tubular profile in end view one way of many possible ways of manufacturing a multi layer wall thickness is to flatten one or more expanded tubular profiles of the same or different structures. The multi layer wall thickness can also be fabricated by assembling two or more expanded sheets of the same or different structure. It is also possible to create a multiple layer expanded tubular profile by assembling two or more expanded tubular profiles of the same or different structure. One more way of producing a multi layer wall thickness is to assemble two or more wall thickness of unstretched material in any configuration such a tubular or sheet and then stretch the assembly to convert the assembly into a wall thickness of multiple layers of the expanded material . The multi layer wall thickness expanded tubular profile of course can be optionally converted into the expanded sheet or expanded fiber .

As just discussed the wall thickness or the multi layer wall thickness can be comprised of one or more layers of expanded material of the same or different structure. For example one layer can be more porous than another. Moreover the fibril size fibril orientation fibril straightness void size node size density thickness permeability porosity or combinations thereof can be varied from layer to layer. The multi layer wall thickness optionally includes the connecting material or other means to facilitate partially or fully holding the layers together. Alternatively the multiple layers can be partially or fully attached mechanically thermally ultrasonically welding compression etc. The multi layer wall thickness can be optionally quilted so that pockets formed contain additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as active ingredients.

The uniformly expanded material of the present invention provides an unusually accurate dosage of the active ingredients especially when delivered over extended periods of time.

As schematically illustrated in the expanded material is optionally densified so that its specific gravity or density is partially or fully increased. Moreover the densification can substantially reduce or eliminate the porosity of the expanded material if desired. The expanded material can be fully densified or partially densified. The undensified expanded material shown in is for example densified by utilizing a compressive force thermal treatment or combinations thereof as shown in to partially or fully reduce the void content of the expanded material as shown in .

The expanded material is optionally densified when it includes one or more additives nano size articles connecting material or combinations thereof. The densification process partially or fully retains the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. The optional connecting material can partially or fully retain the densified structure with or without thermal treatment. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are for example optionally a particle tube or fiber shape. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are optionally partially or fully an active ingredient. The nano size articles are optionally useful in delivering the active ingredients. The active ingredients are optionally microencapsulated.

The covering optionally partially or fully covers the inside surface outside surface ends or combinations thereof. For example the covering can optionally only partially or fully cover the first end and second end to provide a more durable area where sutures are used to connect the expanded material to another object. Alternatively the covering optionally partially or fully covers the surfaces of the individual voids fibrils nodes or combinations thereof. The covering is substantially permanent or erodible. The covering can also optionally partially or fully fill the voids .

The covering optionally includes one or a plurality of additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. The inside surface outside surface or any surface of the expanded material can be treated to increase adhesion of the covering to these surfaces. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are for example optionally a particle tube or fiber shape. The covering can optionally partially or fully evaporate or otherwise partially or fully disappear leaving behind additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as active ingredients on the surface of the expanded material . The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are optionally partially or fully an active ingredient. The nano size articles are optionally useful in delivering the active ingredients. The active ingredients are optionally microencapsulated. There can optionally also be different concentrations or types of the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredient from one layer of the covering to another layer of the covering . There can also optionally be different types of covering from layer of covering to layer of covering . Inactive ingredients the covering concentration or combinations thereof are sometimes employed to dilute the active ingredients to achieve the desired dosage or dosage distribution.

These additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can also be positioned partially or fully within or on the surface of the voids nodes fibrils or combinations thereof. Due to the typical small dimensions of the voids nodes and fibrils it is sometimes desirable to use a very small form of the additives that are herein referred to as nano size articles . Moreover one or more of layers of the covering connecting material or combinations thereof can be applied underneath or over the additives or the nano size articles .

The reinforcement is optionally expandable or contractible from a first size and shape to a second size and shape.

As schematically illustrated in a tubular embodiment in the reinforcement optionally includes a plurality of member segments . The member segments are of uniform or varying thickness and can be of any cross sectional shape. The reinforcement can optionally for example include one or more longitudinal member segments radial member segments angled member segments helical member segments curved member segments angled member segments or combinations thereof. Although not necessary the reinforcement preferably forms a mesh or lattice structure. The open area between the member segments is an open cell . The open cells can be of any shape as a few examples are schematically shown in .

The open cells are optionally fully or partially surrounded by the member segments . illustrates an example of wherein the open cells are fully surrounded with the member segments and shows an example wherein a few of the open cells are partially surrounded by the member segments so that there is at least one open member segment .

As previously described the reinforcement of the present invention optionally includes one or more layers of the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet expanded fiber or combinations thereof connecting material covering or combinations thereof. These supplementary materials can be positioned on the inside surface outside surface surfaces of the member segments or combinations thereof of the reinforcement .

As shown in the reinforcement in first size typically has first shaped open cells and first size internal angles . As shown in upon deformation or self expansion the reinforcement optionally changes to second size and shape resulting in the open cells and internal angles also changing to a second size and shape. In this example of the inventive functionality the reinforcement is increased in size from first diameter to second diameter that results in the internal angles also changing. In addition the shape of the open cells changes from a rectangular shape to a polygonal shape.

As an example is illustrated in the reinforcement is optionally divided into two or more connected or disconnected segments to allow the reinforcement to conform to tighter radiuses. For example the individual reinforcement segments can be attached to each other with one or more substantially more flexible connecting members that increase the overall flexibility of the articulated reinforcement . A reinforcement as shown in that is comprised of multiple segments to form an articulated reinforcement can be optionally changed from first size and shape to second size and shape so that for example the size of the individual segments are different. Thus the reinforcement can have a variable size from the first end to the second end where each segment has a different size and shape. Moreover each segment can have a different ending shape from first end to second end so that an optimal fit is obtained for each individual segment with the supporting member .

The member segments of the reinforcement are optionally of varying or uniform cross sectional dimension thickness stiffness flexibility or combinations thereof to minimize stress concentrations. Stress concentrations can result in failure of the supporting member at the junction of the supporting member and the reinforcement and or expanded material when there is for example a change in wall thickness stiffness or a notch. The reinforcement is capable of compressing or holding the expanded material against the supporting member .

The reinforcement of the present invention can be of any material that provides the functionality described herein. However it is preferred that the reinforcement is comprised of a formable composite that includes a plurality of substantially discontinuous deformable elements that are partially or fully interconnected as shown in or encapsulated as shown in with one or more binders . The binder partially or fully holds the deformable elements substantially together as a pair or group of deformable elements . The deformable elements for the most part are capable of retaining the first size and shape until after deformation or after self expansion wherein they retain the second size and shape. The binder optionally includes one or more of the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can optionally partially or fully protrude from the inside surface outside surface or combinations thereof of the reinforcement or any surface of the member segments . The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are for example optionally a particle tube or fiber shape. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are optionally partially or fully an active ingredient. The nano size articles are optionally useful in delivering the active ingredients. The active ingredients are optionally microencapsulated. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients are optionally delivered to the surroundings by for example releasing eluting emitting diffusing dissolving leaching reacting associating or combinations thereof. The delivery is for example constant rate ascending rate descending rate changing rate or combinations thereof. The delivery is for example immediate time delayed modified release sustained or combinations thereof.

The reinforcement optionally includes one or a plurality of somewhat sharp ends to partially or fully attach the reinforcement to the supporting member expanded material or combinations thereof so that they do not substantially move once positioned. The reinforcement also optionally includes one or a plurality of blunt ends to at least partially prevent the reinforcement from damaging or snagging the supporting member . The blunt end can for example be in the form of any eyelets rings bent portions or curved portions. The blunt end can also be used for example to place the reinforcement expanded material or combinations thereof in tension or compression to change their size and or shape. Once the tension or compression is removed the reinforcement expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile or combinations thereof can optionally change from first size and shape to second size and shape or the shape of nearby constraints.

The delivery is for example constant rate ascending rate descending rate changing rate or combinations thereof. The delivery is for example time delayed modified release sustained or combinations thereof.

The encapsulated additives or nano size articles such as the active ingredients can also be adapted so that one or a plurality of additives or nano size articles or group thereof are delivered through the top layer of the expanded material and another or group thereof is delivered through the bottom layer of expanded material . For example in a vascular stent graft an immunosuppressive agent can elute through the outside surface in contact with the vessel and an anti clotting agent can elute through the inside surface that contacts the blood. It is also possible to regulate the amount of active ingredient delivered by the use of different structures such as the porosity of the expanded material . The delivery can also be additionally regulated through the use of the covering on the expanded material the amount of densification of the expanded material microencapsulation or combinations thereof. When installed for example in a blood carrying vessel the endothelium can partially or fully grow through the thru holes to partially or fully line the inside surface of the assembly.

To overcome the potential problem of the coverings additives nano size articles connecting materials or combinations thereof from separating from the surfaces of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof it is preferred that the outside surface the inside surface surfaces of the member segments or combinations thereof are optionally treated or include one or a plurality of undercuts to increase adhesion. The surface treatment or undercuts which increase adhesion can also overcome the problem of delamination of multiple layers of the expanded material or separation between the reinforcement or the supporting member and the expanded material .

Although some of the illustrations in the figures show the structure of the expanded material such as the fibrils voids and nodes as essentially identical in size and in shape they can in practice have an infinite variety of shapes and sizes within the scope of the present invention. Moreover the optional nodes can sometimes or always be clumped together attached to one another or be hollow.

The fibrils of the present invention can be of any length that meets the requirements of the end use application but they are preferably in the range of about 0 to 25 000 microns more preferably in the range of about 0 to 500 microns and most preferably in the range of about 0 to 250 microns. The fibrils can be of any cross sectional size but are generally in the range of about 0 to 10 microns more preferably in the range of about 0.0005 to 5 microns and most preferably less than 0.5 micron. The cross sectional size of the fibrils can also vary across the length of the fibrils. The voids in material can range from about 0 to 99 volume percent. The voids can be any size that meets the requirements of the end use application but it is preferable to have a nominal void size in the range of about 0.05 to 0.4 microns for the expanded material when used in high efficiency filtration end use applications. The nodes can be any size that meets the requirements of the end use application but they are preferably in the range of about 0 to 2 500 microns more preferably in the range of about 0 to 500 microns and most preferably in the range of about 0 to 50 microns. The size and shape of the fibrils voids and nodes can vary from embodiment to embodiment but it is preferable to minimize this variation within an embodiment to produce a uniformly expanded material .

The expanded material of the present invention is obtained by stretching or drawing any material during the manufacturing process in the axial direction circumferential direction or combinations thereof. As previously indicated the expanded material can also be produced by stretching in sheet configuration but this produces a less uniform product. This is achieved for example by stretching the material during or after the extrusion process at an elevated temperature. Optionally blending of the material to be expanded with any solvent lubricant or another aid prior to stretching the material can facilitate the expansion process.

Circumferential stretching is imparted on the unexpanded tubular profile by stretching the unexpanded tubular profile in any way from its first diameter D to a second larger diameter D. Increasing the diameter through a circumferential force increases the circumference of the unexpanded tubular profile making it larger. The expanded tubular profile can be optionally stretched a second time to take its diameter from a second diameter D to a third diameter D . In fact the tubular profile can be stretched circumferentially an infinite amount of times in vary degrees and or rates of expansion. For illustration purposes only and without intent on limiting the tubular profile has a first diameter D of 50.8 mm 2 inches a second diameter D of 101.6 mm 4 inches and a third diameter D of 203.2 mm 8 inches . Therefore the first stretch is 100 or 2 1. Likewise the second stretch is 100 or 2 1. To achieve a uniformly expanded tubular profile having a uniform structure it is important to carefully control the expansion from first diameter to subsequent diameters. Alternatively an unexpanded sheet can be optionally stretched from first width to second width third width and so on if produced in sheet form.

To achieve a uniformly expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile the final circumference and or diameter preferably does not vary in size from first end to second end more than about 200 preferably no more than the range of about 0 50 and most preferably no more than the range of about 0 15 .

Axial stretching is imparted on the unexpanded tubular profile by stretching the unexpanded tubular profile from its first length L to its second length L. The expanded tubular profile can be optionally stretched a second time to take its length from a second length L to a third length L. The tubular profile can be axially stretched an infinite amount of times in varying degrees and or rates of expansion. For illustration purposes only and without intent on limiting the tubular profile has a first length L of 152.4 mm 6 inches a second length L of 304.8 mm 12 inches and a third length L of 609.6 mm 24 inches . Therefore the first stretch is 100 or 2 1. Likewise the second stretch is 100 or 2 1. To achieve a uniformly expanded tubular profile having uniform cross section it is important to carefully control the expansion from first length to subsequent length.

The material or the expanded material of the present invention can be stretched circumferentially axially or any combinations thereof an infinite amount of times at any rate of stretch change in size temperature or combination thereof up to the point of substantially breaking the wall thickness . In addition the stretching can alternate between circumferential and axial stretching in an infinite amount of combinations.

The present invention of stretching the material or the expanded material in tubular configuration also has the advantage of manufacturing the expanded sheet utilizing far less space. For example to produce an expanded sheet that is 1 meter 39.37 inches wide as described in the prior art requires a machine that is at least that wide. In contrast the preferred process of the present invention only requires equipment about 0.32 meters 12.53 inches wide. This represents a reduction in space requirements of 68 percent. A smaller manufacturing space and equipment also consume far less energy during processing.

The expanded sheet of the present invention has a significantly more uniform wall thickness structure and density across its entire width from third end to fourth end when compared to the heterogeneous expanded sheets described in the prior art. According to the prior art the sheets are normally gripped at the third end and fourth end when stretching in the cross direction. Due to a phenomena frequently referred to as necking down when the sheet of the prior art is stretched by gripping at or near the third end and fourth end it is much thinner around the center and thicker or denser around the third end and fourth end after stretching. The areas near the third end and fourth end of the expanded sheet produced according to the prior art can also be damaged or punctured from gripping. In fact it appears as though a significant amount of the material is rendered waste when using the process of the prior art because the inconsistent or damaged ends near third end and fourth end have to be trimmed off. The wasted material of the prior art substantially increases the cost of producing the stretched expanded material .

The prior art method of producing porous expanded material in sheet configuration also has the disadvantage of being more permeable or porous at the center section and less permeable or porous at the areas near third end and fourth end where it can be thicker or denser. Therefore the porous expanded material of the present invention that is produced in tubular configuration and then slit into a sheet configuration is far more uniformly expanded producing essentially more uniform void size void distribution node size node distribution fibril size fibril distribution or combinations thereof. The net result is a higher quality lower cost material that is suitable for many end use applications.

It is possible to examine the uniformity of the expanded material by measuring the void size void distribution fibril length node size node distribution strength or permeability. To have a uniformly expanded material there should be minimal variation around the circumference of an expanded tubular profile or from third end to fourth end on an expanded sheet without trimming off unexpanded or partially expanded sections. For example the mean length of fibrils located at or near the center of the expanded sheet preferably vary less than about 50 percent more preferably less than about 25 percent and most preferably less than about percent when compared to fibrils located at or near the third end or fourth end of the expanded sheet .

The expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet or expanded fiber can be any size and thickness. Typically its width or diameter will range from under about 0.0127 mm 0.0005 inch to about 3.7 m 144 inch or larger. The wall thickness of the expanded material of the present invention ranges from under about 0.000254 mm 0.00001 inch to about 101.6 mm 4 inches thick or larger. Preferably the expanded material has a wall thickness of under about 0.00127 mm 0.00005 inch to about 50.8 mm 2 inches thick and most preferably from about 0.00127 mm 0.00005 inch or under to about 6.4 mm 0.25 inch thick or larger. The wall thickness however varies according to the size of the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet or expanded fiber and the design requirements of the end use application. For example very small diameter tubular profiles used in medical applications or treatments can require even thinner wall thicknesses. The optimum wall thickness can be experimentally determined by those skilled in the art of engineering. In addition the dimensions can be regulated by governmental or industry codes and standards.

Although it depends on size in general for vascular grafts and stent grafts the preferred wall thickness of the expanded material is less than about 1 mm 0.039 inch more preferably less than about 0.5 mm 0.019 inch and most preferably less than about 0.2 mm 0.007 inch . The mean fibril length is preferred to be in the range of about 0 to 0.15 mm 0 to 0.0059 inch more preferably in the range of about 0 to 0.09 mm 0 to 0.0035 inch and most preferably in the range of about 0 to 0.03 mm 0 to 0.0011 inch . The preferred void size is preferably less than about 0.01 mm 0.0004 inch more preferably less than about 0.005 mm 0.0002 inch and most preferably less than about 0.003 mm 0.0001 inch .

The covering is any substance that is capable of partially or fully covering the surfaces of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. The covering can be any layer coating droplet veneer finish varnish glaze membrane blanket patina paint plating dusting crust film sheet skin mist or combinations thereof that meets the requirements of the end use application.

Furthermore one or more additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be dissolved dispersed or suspended in a solvent with or without a binder and applied as the covering in the present invention.

The covering can be optionally soft T20 C. . Moreover the covering can be transparent translucent or opaque. The covering can be permeable semi permeable substantially impermeable or completely impermeable. The covering can be of any thickness. The thickness of the covering can be controlled through multiple applications or layers of the covering solids content polymer volume concentration viscosity or combinations thereof. The type of the covering additives nano size articles active ingredients or combinations thereof can vary from one layer of the covering to another layer of the covering .

The covering can be applied by any means that meets the requirements of the end use application. Without intent of limiting a few examples of preferred methods of applying the covering to the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof include activated reactive evaporation aerosolization atomization bath brush chemical vapor deposition diff lusion dip electroplating electrostatic fumed immersion ion implantation ion plating mechanical plating painting molecular beam epitaxy MBE physical vapor deposition powder coating plating pulsed laser surface deposition printing rolling sherardising spray sputter deposition thermal spraying tumbling vapor or combinations thereof.

Adhesion of the covering to the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof can be very critical in some end use applications of the present invention. For example in medical applications it is sometimes undesirable to have the covering flake off the surface of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. A relatively long lasting covering can be difficult to achieve in combination with materials like for example polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE or polyethylene. The surface treatments such as those described herein dramatically improve the adhesion of the covering . Moreover the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof that are partially or fully located on the surface are useful for increasing adhesion. In the present invention it is preferred that the surface treatments or additives extend the life of the covering on the surface of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof preferably by more than about 5 percent more preferably by more than about 30 percent and most preferably more than about 200 percent when compared to untreated expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. One method of measuring the relative life of the covering is by scrub cycles utilizing a modified version of ASTM D 2486. For example when one sheet of the covered expanded material including a surface treatment or additives is compared to another covered expanded material excluding a surface treatment or additives the covering on the expanded material including the surface treatment or additives lasts substantially more scrub cycles without substantial erosion of the covering from the surface of the expanded material or substrate. When using scrub cycles as an indicator of the covering life care must be taken to isolate the performance of the covering in end use conditions and to minimize for example the influence of the substrate and brush bristles contact pressure speed etc. .

The coverings can optionally include film formers that cause the plurality of discrete polymer particles normally found in emulsion polymers to coalesce and form a continuous or partially continuous film. The size of the discrete polymer particles in for example the emulsion polymers of the present invention can be any size but they are preferably less than about 10 microns and more preferably less than about 5 microns. The covering can also be optionally being cross linked.

The covering is either a continuous or discontinuous layer on the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. The covering can also be optionally applied in any pattern such as a dot or cross hatch pattern. The amount of delivery rate of delivery or combinations thereof of the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients can be somewhat regulated by the selection of the covering type or by the amount of covering on the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. It is also possible to regulate the delivery or release by the concentration of the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients in the covering . The permeability of the covering or expanded material are also useful means for regulating the amount of delivery rate of delivery or combinations thereof of the additives or nano size articles such as the active ingredients. The time it takes to partially or fully erode the covering is also useful for managing the amount of delivery rate of delivery or combinations thereof.

The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients can be of any concentration in the covering that meets the requirements of the end use application. However the concentration preferably ranges from about 0 98 percent more preferably 0 50 percent and most preferably 0 25 percent. Likewise the concentration or type of the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients can vary from one layer of the covering to another layer of the covering . The type of substance that comprises the covering can also be optionally varied from one layer of covering to another layer of covering .

The covering can be substantially permanent or engineered to erode biodegrade melt crack decompose dissolve or otherwise partially or fully disappear with time so that it is partially or completely removed from the expanded material reinforcement additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. If there are multiple layers of the covering they can be for example engineered to erode or dissolve at different rates. The covering can also crack in vivo to partially or fully release for example the additives nano size article or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients. The covering the structure of the expanded material structure of the binder densification of the expanded material or combinations thereof can provide functionality that is for example immediate release controlled release controlled on set release extended release delayed release sustained release modified release prolonged release or combinations thereof. Therefore the covering structure of the expanded material structure of the binder densification of the expanded material use of inactive ingredients or combinations thereof are for example ways of managing the delivery pharmacokinetics association absorption plasma concentration profile drug concentration biopharmaceutical performance dose proportionality pharmacodynamics rate of absorption extent of absorption activity tissue binding protein binding bioavailability metabolism buccal dissolution GI dissolution reactivity interactivity activity or combinations thereof as well as duration of activity of these materials with their surroundings. Additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients that are time released can provide any dosage over any period of time that meets the requirements of the end use application.

The modified release or sustained release embodiments of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof of the present invention preferably result in the delivery of the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as active ingredients over any period of time ranging from about immediate release to about 50 years or more. The delivery can also be over shorter or longer periods of time for example within the range of about immediate release to under 1 hour immediate release to under 4 hours immediate release to under 24 hours immediate release to under 1 month immediate release to under 6 months immediate release to under 1 year immediate release to under 5 years immediate release to under 10 years immediate release to under 25 years immediate release to under 75 years and so on. The delivery can be optionally at a constant rate ascending rate changing rate or descending rate over time. In the case of delivering a drug or medication this feature is useful in achieving the optimum drug concentration striking a balance between effectiveness of treatment and minimizing negative side effects.

The partial or full disappearance of the covering when used in a human body animal body or other processes can be facilitated through the separate or combined introduction of other chemicals or compounds into the process. For example the acidity of the body or process can be changed to partially or fully remove the covering . Surfactants dispersants or other vehicles can also be utilized to facilitate the transportation of the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients.

The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as active ingredients can be microencapsulated or nanoencapsulated. Microencapsulation is the process of enclosing a substance such as the active ingredients inside a miniature capsule or nanocapsule. The substance inside the capsule is any solid liquid gas or combinations thereof. The microencapsulation optionally includes the covering such as for example gelatin wax or other natural or plastic substances. The microencapsulation can rupture melt dissolve or combinations thereof over time to deliver the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. The microencapsulation may have one wall or multiple walls arranged in a strata of varying thicknesses around the core.

The microencapsulation for example enables the release of the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as active ingredients over longer periods of time can deliver one or more reactive products mask a taste release the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as active ingredients at a specific location in the body or combinations thereof.

The microencapsulation of the present invention can be by any process that encloses a substance like the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients in a relatively miniature capsule or nanocapsule. The microencapsulation can be achieved by any chemical or physical process.

Moreover the material or the expanded material can be produced from or include a resin utilizing core shell technology wherein the resin or polymer particle s outside surface has different characteristics than its inside. For example the outside surface can be harder or softer than its core.

As already mentioned the material expanded material binder connecting material covering reinforcement or combinations thereof optionally include the additives . The additives can be any solid liquid gas or combinations thereof. The additive can be of any size. The smaller additives are herein referred to as nano size articles . The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof included with the material expanded material binder covering connecting member reinforcement or combinations thereof can be in the range of about 0 99 percent. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be discrete agglomerated partially agglomerated unagglomerated or combinations thereof.

The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can modify any property or functionality of the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet expanded fiber binder covering connecting member reinforcement or combinations thereof such as for example improving or modifying abrasion resistance e.g. scrub cycles adhesion anti clotting anti restenosis anti static anti stenosis anti thrombosis anti inflammatory bioactivity biodegradability blocking resistance buckle resistance chemical resistance circumferential stiffness cleanability color compressive strength conductivity connectivity e.g. bonding fusion sewing electrical etc. crush resistance curability cut resistance e.g. Ashland cut Protection Performance Test density dielectric strength digestibility durability elasticity energy absorption external loading feel flame retardancy flexibility hardness human body acceptance human body acceptance as implant hydrolytic stability hydrophilicity hydrophobicity impact resistance imperviousness implant acceptance infrared absorption insulating properties intumescence kink resistance locate ability longitudinal stiffness mar resistance memory microbial resistance mildew resistance permeability photo stability pressure carrying capability puncture resistance quietness radiation absorption reactivity reduce shrinkage resiliency resistivity reflectivity rigidity rodent repellency scratch resistance shape shape recovery size recovery shielding sound absorption spring likeness stability stain resistance stiffness strength surface energy surface tension suture retention strength tear resistance tensile strength thermal conductivity thermal stability tissue exclusion tissue growth tissue in growth toughness UV stability washability weather ability or combinations thereof. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be optionally adapted with a coating or plating.

The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are optionally partially or fully active ingredients e.g. bioactive chemically active etc. or inactive ingredients e.g. inert . The active ingredients are at least one chemical chemical compound biological or biological compound that works with human or other animal bodies or any other surroundings. Without intent on limiting for medical end use applications or treatments the active ingredients can furnish pharmacological activity bring the relief of symptoms effect the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or affect the structure or any function of the body of humans or animals. Inactive ingredients have relatively little or no effect on its surroundings. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients can be micro encapsulated or nanoencapsulated to modify the release of the active ingredients. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients can optionally at least partially invoke a biological response block a biological response modulate a biological response or combinations thereof from the surroundings. The active ingredients of the present invention can be optionally developed or modified to for example suppress prevent or kill future presently unknown strains or variations of bacteria viruses diseases etc.

The nano size articles optionally include active ingredients. The nano size articles for example can include one or more antibodies proteins or combinations thereof that are attached to the nano sized articles . The antibodies proteins or combinations thereof can for example target cancer cells to selectively kill them with or without damaging healthily cells. They can be optionally engineered to attach to a specific cell s receptor. For example a carbon nano tube can be coated with a protein that seeks out and attaches to a cancer cell.

The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be optionally exploded in vivo within a living organism . The nano size articles can be for example nanobombs that upon delivery to the targeted area are exploded with for example a light laser radiation thermal treatment ultrasound magnetic field chemical reaction electric charge biological response or combinations thereof. The explosion can for example modulate the growth of or partially or fully destroy unhealthy cells modulate the growth of healthy cells modulate the growth of or partially or fully destroy bacteria or viruses mitigate or destroy blood clots or artery clogging plaque or lesions partially or fully sever blood vessels or combinations thereof.

The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be included with the material or the expanded material before during or after stretching. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be included with the material expanded material binder connecting material reinforcement covering or combinations thereof during for example polymerization compounding blending mixing extrusion stretching heating cooling coating densification lamination adaptation or in other subsequent processes. Sometimes it is desirable to employ more than one additive or nano size article at a time in the present invention to obtain for example a synergistic effect or multi capability multi functionality. Use of inactive additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can also dilute the active additives nano size articles or combinations thereof used with the expanded material binder connecting material reinforcement covering or combinations thereof to obtain the correct dosage or distribution of for example active ingredients.

The additives or nano size articles can be any configuration aspect ratio morphology or shape that meets the requirements of the end use application. For example they can be particle tube or fiber shaped. They can also be for example a shape of a block helix torus sphere hollow sphere angled member elongated member etc. as some embodiments are shown if . In some end use applications it is useful to employ additives nano size articles or combinations thereof that bloom to the surface of the material expanded material reinforcement covering binder or combinations thereof. The additives or nano size articles can be absorbent and or porous to hold other materials or additives nano size articles or combinations thereof that are for example active ingredients. One or a plurality of additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be utilized to carry or deliver another or plurality of additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as active ingredients. For instance a nano size particle can be coated with an active ingredient so that the active ingredient can be for example delivered to very difficult to reach areas of the human body upon release.

The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be positioned in a uniform heterogeneous or random distribution. Furthermore a binding material can be used to attach the additives or nano size articles to each other or to the structure of the material expanded material voids fibrils nodes wall thickness reinforcement covering or combinations thereof.

The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be optionally attached to the expanded material reinforcement binder covering or combinations thereof thermally. For example the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be attached to any surface of the expanded material reinforcement binder covering or combinations thereof when they are at an elevated temperature and still at least partially tacky. A tacky surface enables the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof to be thermally attached and substantially difficult to remove after the expanded material reinforcement covering or combinations thereof cool. Conversely the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be heated and applied to the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can cover the surface of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof in the range of about to percent. The thermally attached additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can provide a good bonding surface for additional layers of the covering additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. The strength or durability of the attachment of the additives nano size articles the covering or combinations thereof to the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof can be for example measured by scrub cycles.

The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are optionally applied to the material expanded material reinforcement binder covering or combinations thereof in one or more layers in any way that meets the requirements of the end use application. Without intent of limiting a few examples of preferred methods of applying additives nano size articles or combinations thereof include adhesion aerosol activated reactive evaporation bath bonding brush coating chemical vapor deposition chemical reaction chemical bonding diffusion dip electroplating electrostatic fusion fumed grafting immersion ion implantation ion plating mechanical plating molecular beam epitaxy MBE painting physical vapor deposition pulsed laser surface deposition powder coating plating rolling sherardising spray sputter deposition thermal spraying tumbling vapor or combinations thereof.

The nano size articles are a particularly useful form of the additives in the present invention because they can optionally fit partially or substantially fully within the nodes and or very small fibrils . The nano size articles can be of any substance material or compound and without intent on limiting are preferably those with one or more dimensions having a nominal size substantially less than about 1000 nanometers more preferably those with nominal size substantially less than about 500 nanometers and most preferably those less than about nanometers. The nano size articles sometimes for example like carbon nano tubes can be several nanometers in diameter but several millimeters or centimeters or more in length. The nano size articles can be of any shape such as particles fibers spheres bent curved helical tube crystals etc. In addition to those mentioned elsewhere in this specification and without intent on limiting a few examples of the nano size articles of the present invention include for example alloy nano particles nano particles armchair nanotubes bent nano tubes bucky badgers boron nitride nanotubes carbon nanotubes CNT cobalt nanowires copper nanowires core shell nanoparticles dendritic forms of nano particles double walled carbon nanotubes DWNT filled nano tubes fullerites fullerene derivative bucky balls germanium nanotubes gold nanowires inorganic nanotubes manganese oxide nanotubes liposome nanoparticles multi wall carbon nanotubes MWNTs nanobombs nanocrystalline silicon nano crystals nano cups nano drops nano elastomers nano fibers nano gels nano horns nano particles nano particles with metal core and oxide shell nano pillars nano ribbons nano rings nano scale materials nano rods nano tubes nanotorus nano wafers nano wires polymerized single walled nanotubes P SWNT quantum dots quantum wells quantum wires silicon nanotubes silicon nanowires single wall nanotubes SWCNTs vanadium oxide nanotubes or combinations thereof. The nano size articles can be a single component or multi component such as a composite. The large relative surface area of nano size articles provides unusual properties to the expanded material reinforcement covering binder or combinations thereof.

Positioning the nano size articles partially or substantially within the material nodes fibrils reinforcement covering binder connecting member or combinations thereof can make the aforementioned components very strong abrasion resistant or have properties mentioned herein that are much different than the virgin material that does not contain the nano size articles . For example incorporating the nano size articles with the expanded material can dramatically increase abrasion resistance as demonstrated by measuring scrub cycles. A modified version of ASTM D 2486 can be useful in measuring the improvement in abrasion resistance of the present invention. For example if one sheet of the expanded material containing the nano size articles and another excluding the nano size articles are laminated to a board and scrubbed with a brush the expanded material containing the nano size articles lasts substantially more scrub cycles without substantially tearing or abrading when compared to the expanded material excluding the nano size articles . The nano size articles also can also permit stretching the material without substantially breaking the wall thickness .

The nano size articles optionally enable the production of the expanded material having very thin wall thicknesses of unusual strength. For example and without intent on limiting the very thin wall thickness can be produced in the range of about 0 to 0.10 mm 0 to 0.0039 inch and even as thin as in the range of about 0 to 0.01 mm 0 to 0.00039 inch . The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof also optionally enable the material the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof to be much stronger than the material expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof excluding the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. For example the tensile strength or hoop strength of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof is without intent on limiting preferably increased in the range of about 0 to 10 more preferably in the range of about 10 to 100 and most preferably increased greater than about 100 vs. the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof excluding the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. The material strengthening additives of the present invention include any additives or nano size articles that have a tensile strength or hardness substantially greater than the material in which the expanded material is comprised of. In addition to the nano size articles mentioned elsewhere in this specification and without intent on limiting some of the most preferred nano size articles for increasing the strength of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof include carbon nano tubes multi wall carbon nano tubes single wall nanotubes silicon nanotubes carbon nano fiber ceramic particles ceramic fiber nano crystalline silicon glass particles glass nano fiber or combinations thereof.

The nano size articles of the present invention can have any activity aspect ratio size distribution degree of agglomeration crystallinity porosity homogeneity stoichiometry symmetry surface properties surface coating absorption purity etc. that meets the requirements of the end use application. Without intent on limiting preferably the nano size articles are optionally synthesized for example by using laser ablation condensation from vapor thermal decomposition wet chemical reduction of metal salts arc discharge chemical vapor deposition CVD plasma enhanced CVD electrochemical deposition electric glow discharge wet chemical colloidal processes flame pyrolysis methods high temperature evaporation plasma synthesis microwave plasma mechanical processes e.g. grinding alloying milling etc. colloidal or liquid phase methods e.g. chemical reactions in solvents that lead to formation of colloids furnace flow reactors laser induced pyrolysis laser vaporization sonochemistry therma plasma sputtering droplet evaporation or any process know by those skilled in the art of manufacturing nano size articles.

The voids dimples or indentations like the under cuts within the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet expanded fiber reinforcement covering or combinations thereof can also be packed with additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as active ingredients so that for example the voids or the open spaces between fibrils and or nodes are partially or fully filled. A binder adhesive or other material can be optionally employed to hold the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof in place or attach the filling to the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can also be partially or fully locked into the voids or open spaces by densifying the expanded material after the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are positioned with the expanded material .

Additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can also give the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet expanded fiber reinforcement or combinations thereof pigmentation and or magnetic signal characteristics. Moreover other additives or nano size articles can be used as extenders or fillers to reduce the cost of the expanded material reinforcement covering connecting member binder or combinations thereof by partially substituting a lower cost material for the material covering or binder . The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof optionally included with the material expanded material binder covering or combinations thereof can be any materials known by those skilled in the art of additives or fillers that achieve the requirements of the end use application or provide the properties or functionality described herein.

It is also possible to use these additives or nano size articles in combinations with other additives or nano size articles like the ones mentioned herein.

As previously mentioned the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof optionally include the supporting member . The supporting member optionally serves as a host to the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. For example a blood carrying artery in a human body can be the supporting member . Another example of the supporting member is an underground pipe. In either of these examples the expanded material such as one that is in the form of the expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof can be inserted into the bore of the blood carrying artery or the underground pipe and can be positioned for example so that they cover a weak spot or a constricted area. The expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof in these examples can at least partially reinforce or line the inside surface of the supporting member or host especially in the area of the weakened or constricted area. The expanded material such as in the form of an expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof can also hold open the bore of a constricted supporting member so that the contents can flow through the bore.

The expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof can also be positioned between two supporting members . For example a section of the supporting member can be removed and replaced with a section of the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof as a spool piece. The areas of connection between the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile and the supporting member can optionally be sealed to prevent for example the contents from leaking out of the bore . The expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof can also be an extension to the supporting member .

The expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof are optionally positioned with the supporting member by any means know by those skilled in the art of assembly. They can be for example assembled inserted wrapped ingested swallowed co extruded insert molded injection molded blow molded an extension cut in vacuum molded rotary molded transfer molded pressure formed cast to form pulled pushed dilated collapsed spin casted reaction injection molded surgically implanted installed with non invasive surgery techniques positioned among others. When inserted a guide wire cable catheter or other deployment system is optionally utilized to pull or push the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof into the supporting member . The expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof are optionally inserted at an open end trench incision or other opening. The supporting member expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof can be pressurized or unpressurized. They can be empty full or partially full of the contents . The contents can also be flowing or static during insertion. The flow can be at least partially stopped in the area of insertion by valves squeezing off pinching inflatable devices or by other means if necessary.

The deployment system can optionally include means for attaching or anchoring the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof to the supporting member or another object. For example it can adhere fuse graft sew interference fit weld hook staple mechanically attach or otherwise fully or partially interconnect the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof to the supporting member . Furthermore the deployment system can optionally include means for dilating the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof once they are in final position. The expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile can be for example mechanically expanded self expanding or combinations thereof. If the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof are at first size and shape the deployment system can change them to second size and shape so that their bore is partially or fully open when in final installed position. The deployment system can optionally adjust the second size and shape so that for example the final size and shape of the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof are optimized for fit such as variable in size from first end to second end. The deployment system can also deform the expanded material . reinforcement or combinations thereof so that when changed from first size and shape to second size and shape the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof substantially maintains the second size and shape after removal of the deployment system. Alternatively the deployment system can position the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof and remove a constraint such as a sleeve sheath filament thread ribbon and so on that keeps the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof in first size and shape until they are released of the constraint thereby enabling the shape memory of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof to change to a second size and shape in a way that that the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof are positioned against the bore of the supporting member in such a way that a radial expansion force of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof maintains the installed position after removal of the deployment system. An inflatable device e.g. balloon internal pressurization mechanical device or other means are useful for dilating the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof within the supporting member . The deployment device can also be optionally adapted with a camera or another device which allows the operator to visualize the insertion process. It is also possible for the deployment system to be optionally adapted with aerosol drip spray pneumatic flow hydraulic lighting laser mechanical ultrasonic pumping radiation electric discharge dispensing magnetic field stapler or thermal modification capabilities. The deployment system can also optionally be capable of partially or fully removing scale biological growth deposits lesions etc. located in the supporting member . The deployment system can for example optionally perform angioplasty. The deployment system can also optionally assemble multiple expanded tubular profiles reinforcements or combinations thereof for example in branch bifurcated or tee configuration.

The supporting member can be new or used. A used supporting member could be for example one that previously served as a piping system passageway or vessel that carried processed transported or stored any gas liquid or solid before the installation the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. A used supporting member can have a uniformly sized bore or the bore can be partially or fully bowed enlarged deformed bent bifurcated constricted curved swollen or combinations thereof. Moreover the bore inside surface outside surface or combination thereof of the supporting member can have scale biological growth or other forms of obstructions.

The supporting member is comprised of any material that meets the requirements of the end use application. Without intent on limiting a few examples of useful materials for partial or full composition of the supporting member include for example acrylonitrile butadiene ABS alloys aluminum animal or human organs animal or human cells or tissue arteries animal or human passageways biocompatible materials bladder blood carrying vessels body fluid carrying vessels bone biliary duct biological tissue brass breast bronze carbon carbon steel cast iron biological cells ceramics chlorinated polyvinyl chloride CPVC clay colon or digestive tract concrete copper ductile iron elastomers ethylene propylene diene monomer EPDM fabric fiberglass galvanized steel glass gold graphite gums human or animal body vessels lead ligaments lung lumen natural rubber neoprene neoprene nonwovens nylon organs passageways palladium partially or fully digested food carrying vessels particle reinforced plastic plant cells or tissue plastic platinum polyamide polyester polyether keytone PEK polyethylene PE polyisoprene polypropylene PP polysulfones polyvinyl chloride PVC resin rubber scalp skin stainless steel steel tantalum tendons tissue titanium tungsten urinary tract veins wood zirconium their precursors or derivatives or combinations thereof. In some cases the supporting member has holes corrosion scale biological growth lesions plaque cracks weak spots joints etc.

The supporting member can be any size or shape that meets the requirements of the end use application. The clearance between the supporting member and the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof can range from zero clearance to substantial clearance. It is also possible that the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile sheet fiber reinforcement or combinations thereof can be shorter or longer than the supporting member .

In cases where the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile sheet or fiber reinforcement or combinations thereof are employed to for example line or re line the interior of the supporting member the preferred embodiment of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof can be optionally at least partially flexible to facilitate installation. Flexibility allows the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile sheet or fiber reinforcement or combinations thereof to be optionally at least temporarily collapsed reduced in size folded flattened pleated converted into a U shape or combinations thereof for easy insertion into the supporting member . Flexibility also enables the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof to navigate multiple bends in one or more planes if needed.

The expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof can also be optionally relatively or absolutely rigid or inflexible. A rigid or substantially inflexible expanded material such as an expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof can be optionally for example swaged to reduce its size prior to insertion to provide at least a temporary clearance with supporting member just prior to or during insertion.

The expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof can optionally have shape memory or superelasticity. One way of providing the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof with shape memory is to include one or more materials in these components with shape memory characteristics. Shape memory materials like for example Nitinol available from Nitinol Devices Components Fremont Calif. or Memry Bethel Conn. or alloys of nickel and titanium enable the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof to be self expanding. Self expansion for example enables the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof to change from first size and shape to second size and shape substantially without mechanical deformation. A self expanding expanded material reinforcement or combination thereof can be for example constricted to a smaller size when positioned on a catheter constrained in size inserted into a supporting member such as a blood carrying passageway and upon deployment increase in size to fit the bore of the supporting member by release of the constraint. A shape memory alloy is capable of remembering a previously memorized shape. Nitinol alloys are sometimes for example given shape memory by deforming the material in its low temperature phase Martensite and subsequently heating to the high temperature phase Austenite e.g. in hot water or with an electrical current. The shape memory characteristics can be fine tuned by composition of the alloys.

The expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof can optionally include one or more materials having different properties at different conditions. For example a material that is substantially flexible and pliable at a first condition can transform into a substantially stiffer material at a second condition. Moreover it is sometimes useful in the present invention to utilize materials which exhibit a martensite phase wherein the material has relatively low tensile strength and an austenite phase wherein the material exhibits a relatively high tensile strength. It is useful in the present invention to modify the transition temperature of the alloy from Martensite to Austenite to improve the deliverability adjustability or functionality of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof.

If the supporting member is somewhat pliable it is possible to somewhat enlarge or modify the size and or shape of the supporting member during deployment of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. The expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile sheet or fiber reinforcement or combinations thereof can also be modified to fit for example multiple curves of the supporting member or other objects. They can also bend without substantially kinking or closing the bore . Upon positioning of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof they can optionally somewhat relax to minimize stress imposed on the supporting member .

It is optionally possible to install the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof with the constraining or deforming means and sell the assembly as a unit which can be subsequently combined with the deployment system used to install the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof. For example the reinforcement that is used as a stent can be assembled on a balloon catheter and sold as a unit.

If the wall thickness of the expanded material is porous the voids can be optionally designed to partially or fully prevent leakage of the contents through the voids. Leakage can be prevented by for example hydrophobicity of the material hydrophobicity of the covering void size multiple layers of expanded material densification of the expanded material thermal treatment or combinations thereof.

The reinforcement of the present invention provides many possible functions. The need for the reinforcement for example could be due to a supporting member having a hole an enlarged bore a reduced bore a crack or tear a weakened spot e.g. from aging disease corrosion etc. . The reinforcement may also be desirable to increase the strength of thin or insufficiently strong expanded material or a thin or low strength supporting members . The reinforcement is also useful for opening enlarging or holding open the bore of the supporting member especially those that have been restricted in size from aging disease or other reasons or for compressing or holding the expanded material against the supporting member . The reinforcement is also useful for enabling the expanded material to have shape or size memory e.g. open the bore of a self expanding expanded tubular profile after removal of a constraint or to make it self supporting e.g. hold open bore . The reinforcement also has utility for partially or fully eliminating the damage of occlusion caused by flaps or fissuring from intimal tears associated with angioplasty.

The reinforcement can be for example optionally modified in size and or shape circumferentially e.g. from first diameter to second diameter axially e.g. from first length to second length transversely e.g. from first width to second width multi axially or combinations thereof. The change in size and or shape can be temporary or permanent. The change in size and shape from first size and shape to second size and shape can be achieved through deformation e.g. mechanically like with a balloon catheter or through self expansion. To deploy the reinforcement for example into the supporting member the reinforcement can be temporarily in a somewhat smaller size so that there is clearance between the outside surface of reinforcement and the inside surface of the supporting member until reaching its location of installation. The reinforcement of the present invention can be incrementally modified or adjusted in size and shape to achieve the desired end size and shape during or after positioning. If the size of the supporting member is miscalculated the reinforcement of the present invention can be adjusted in size and shape to more precisely fit the supporting member . The second size and shape of the reinforcement of the present invention can optionally be variable in size and shape from first end to second end to achieve the best fit with the supporting member . These capabilities minimize the risk of the reinforcement migrating from its installed position if under dilated or from exerting excessive stress on the supporting member if over dilated.

The optional ability of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof of the present invention to be modified in size axially circumferentially transversely multi axially or combinations thereof also permits easier insertion into the supporting member . In addition it permits insertion of longer lengths that need to be strategically positioned and or to navigate one or more bends without substantially damaging the supporting member . This unique feature is especially beneficial when inserting into supporting members that are vessels in the human body wherein installation damage can be detrimental slow the healing process interfere with treatment cause another ailment or result in lingering pain for example.

The reinforcement of the present invention can be of any size and configuration. As shown in the reinforcement can have a substantially solid wall thickness. Alternatively as shown in the reinforcement can have a configuration comprised of a wall thickness including solid and open portions. The solid portions can optionally be partially or fully porous fibrous or combinations thereof. An infinite range of possibilities exist for the configuration of the reinforcement . For example there are many suitable configurations used by those skilled in the art of manufacturing braided tubing stents coils or composites.

The reinforcement comprising a wall thickness of solid and open portions can have for example member segments that are angled member segments radial member segments longitudinal member segments or combinations thereof. shows one embodiment of the reinforcement wherein it is comprised of a plurality of the angled member segments or struts crisscrossing other angled member segments the radial member segments and the longitudinal member segments . shows a second embodiment wherein the radial member segments and longitudinal member segments have been eliminated. The plurality of member segments such as can be connected one piece multi pieces looped welded thermally bonded contain linkages glued or disconnected at crossover points or junctures. To substantially reduce failure during installation or while flexing the reinforcement can optionally include one or more stress relief features. A few examples of stress relief features include radiuses bends curved sections or expansion joints. The member segments of the reinforcement can also be continuous discontinuous randomly oriented or systematically oriented. The reinforcement can be optionally deburred or polished.

The optional open area between the member segments is an open cell . The open cells can be optionally partially or fully covered or closed with a membrane that is solid fibrous porous or combinations thereof material. The open cells can be of any size and shape as several examples are schematically shown in . The size and shape of the open cells can be uniform or varied within one embodiment or from embodiment to embodiment to customize the flexibility manage the longitudinal shrinkage or expansion upon changing size and shape minimize drag within a passageway during insertion modify other properties or combinations thereof. There can be any number of open cells in the present invention so long as the reinforcement provides the functionality described herein. The open cells can for example be in the range of about 0 99 of the surface area of the reinforcement . As shown in the open cells are typically organized in groups of the open cells that are in repeating non repeating meandering or combinations thereof patterns down the length circumference width or combinations thereof of the reinforcement . As also shown in the open cells are optionally interconnected with other open cells with one or more other member segments or connecting members . The open cells are generally partially or fully surrounded by the member segments . illustrates an example of wherein all the open cells are fully surrounded with the member segments and shows an example wherein few of the open cells are partially surrounded by the member segments so that there is at least one open member segment .

The member segments of the reinforcement can be of any cross sectional shape of uniform or varying thickness such as amorphous shaped angular shaped circular shaped concave polygon shaped curved shaped decagon shaped diamond shaped dodecagon shaped elliptical shaped hexagon shaped I beam shaped isogon shaped L shaped multilobal nonagon shaped octagonal shaped parallelogram shaped pentagon shaped polygonal shaped quadrangle shaped quadrilateral shaped rectangular shaped rhombus shaped round shaped spherical polygon shaped square shaped star shaped trapezoid shaped triangular shaped T shaped tubular shaped undecagon shaped U shaped V shaped zig zag shaped or combinations thereof to name a few. The length of the member segments or connecting members can be any shape such as straight curved twisted helical hoop loop bent serpentine semicircular zigzag or whatever shape necessary to obtain the functionality described herein. The length of the member segment can be of any size that meets the functionality described herein. The length and thickness of the member segment can be of uniform length and thickness around a cell or there can be varying lengths and thicknesses utilized around a cell .

The member segments can be optionally single or multiple strands such as wire or fiber of one or more materials. The strands are optionally woven nonwoven knitted zigzagged twisted braided curved serpentine helical wound or combinations thereof. The reinforcement or the strands that comprise the member segments can be continuous or discontinuous.

As shown in the reinforcement in first size has first shaped cells and first size internal angles . As shown in upon deformation or self expansion the reinforcement optionally changes to second size and shape resulting in the cells and internal angels also changing to a second size and shape. In this example of the inventive functionality the reinforcement is increased in size from first diameter to second diameter that results in the first internal angles changing to the second internal angels . Sometimes additional internal angles are formed after expansion wherein the member segments bend to take on the second size and shape of the reinforcement . In addition the shape of the cells changes from a rectangular shape to a polygonal shape.

The reinforcement can be installed independently or it can be installed unattached or attached to the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet or expanded fiber . It can be of any size or cross section that meets the requirements of the end use application. For example the reinforcement expanded material or combinations thereof can be thicker at the center portion and thinner at the ends to reduce the stress at the juncture of the reinforcement and the supporting member . The reinforcement can be of one or more materials. The reinforcement can optionally also be spring like spring loaded or have memory so that when modified in size and or shape it can partially or fully spring back to about a predetermined size or range of sizes and or shapes. The reinforcement can also be mechanically enlarged and substantially hold its second size and shape after removal of the enlarging device.

It is also possible for the reinforcement to optionally include snap fit connections and or hinges. Suitable snap fit connections include annular snap fit tapered arm snap fit straight beam snap fit cantilever snap fit u shaped cantilever snap fit L shaped cantilever snap fit or any interlocking mechanical joint especially those that feature a locate and locking design.

The reinforcement in some cases must be flexible to facilitate navigating one or more bends of one or more planes when being inserted into for example the supporting member . For instance when the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile reinforcement or combinations thereof are inserted into the supporting member that is a human blood carrying artery or other vessel it is usually important for the reinforcement to be flexible so that it can be positioned without causing damage injury or unnecessary pain to the patient. Moreover when installed in a piping system flexibility facilitates insertion through elbows tees and other fittings. As shown in to improve flexibility the reinforcement can optionally include multiple segments or sections like an articulated stent. These sections can be attached or unattached to each other. The optional member segments or connecting members that connect one section to another can be of any configuration such as straight bent spiral zigzag arcuate angled helical curved or combinations thereof in shape or orientation to achieve the greatest flexibility. The separation between sections permits the reinforcement to bend more easily especially around tighter turns than one long section.

The reinforcement can also be optionally applied to the outside surface the inside surface or combinations thereof of the expanded material by forming in place. It is possible for example to apply the reinforcement in a fluid like state and partially or fully cure or otherwise transform the form in place reinforcement from a liquid to a gel foam solid or combination thereof. Preferably the liquid cures into an elastomeric plastic or metallic material of sufficiently high strength to meet the requirements of the end use application.

The expanded material can be optionally temperature controlled during application of the reinforcement . The controlling of temperature can for example prevent the form in place reinforcement from melting through the wall thickness or causing a hole in wall thickness . A low temperature expanded material that has been for example partially or fully frozen prior to or during application of a form in place reinforcement thereby provides it with more tolerance to high temperature applied form in place reinforcements . Moreover it is possible for example to use temporary contents in bore that are static or flowing to conduct or convect heat away from wall thickness by serving as a heat sink.

A temperature differential between the expanded material and the reinforcement during assembly can also build in stress between the different components. Stress can also be built into the assembly by selecting materials of differing rates of thermal expansion. This built in stress for example can be useful for size and shape maintenance or recovery.

The form in place reinforcement can be applied by any way that meets the requirements of the end use application. For example it can be two or more components thermally cured UV cured chemical reaction cured radiation cured light cured moisture cured metals a formable composite alloy biodegradable materials etc. or combinations thereof. The material of the form in place reinforcement can optionally include additives nano size articles deformable elements or combinations thereof. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are optionally a particle tube or fiber shape. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are optionally partially or fully an active ingredient. The nano size articles are optionally useful in delivering the active ingredients. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients are optionally microencapsulated. Inactive ingredients reinforcement material concentration or combinations thereof are sometimes employed to dilute the active ingredients to achieve the desired dosage or dosage distribution. The additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredient are optionally delivered to the surroundings by for example releasing eluting emitting diffusing dissolving leaching reacting associating or combinations thereof. The delivery is for example constant rate ascending rate descending rate changing rate or combinations thereof. The delivery is for example immediate time delayed modified release sustained or combinations thereof.

The form in place reinforcement can be applied in any way such as molded extruded printed painted rolled wrapped sprayed electrostatically transferred to name a few. One way to apply the form in place reinforcement to the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile for example involves at least partially holding open its bore by for example inflating its bore by sealing off its first end and second end and partially or fully pressurizing. One or more elastomeric polymeric metallic or other materials described herein bead is applied to the outside surface of the inflated expanded tubular profile . The inflated expanded tubular profile is optionally rotated while a bead is applied in for example radial zigzag linear helical spiral dot or matrix patterns. Although not necessary the ideal fluid material for a for mn in place reinforcement has a viscosity that permits it to penetrate into and bond to the surface and or structure of the expanded material . The outside surface the inside surface or combinations thereof can also be treated for example as described herein or primed to improve the adhesion of the form in place reinforcement . Furthermore the form in place material preferably has sufficient strength and elasticity upon setting up to partially or fully hold open the bore of the expanded tubular profile . In the most preferred embodiment the expanded tubular profile having a form in place reinforcement is able to be collapsed in size and restored partially or fully to its original shape and or size once the collapsing force is removed. The form in place reinforcement is optionally covered with one or more layers of the expanded material of the same or different structure.

If the form in place reinforcement is at least partially cured during fabrication it can be additionally cured after reaching its ultimate installed location and shape. For example if a vascular graft is inserted into a vein or artery it can be collapsed in size for insertion dilated to open its bore once positioned and then additionally cured in final position. Curing in its final position can be achieved in any way but it is preferred to do so thermally chemically electrically or through use of light e.g. UV radiation or moisture for example.

The expanded tubular profile can optionally be turned inside out prior to the application of the reinforcement and then inverted so that the reinforcement is positioned on the inside surface . Conversely the reinforcement can be applied to the inside surface and then inverted so that the reinforcement is on the outside surface .

Another method of positioning the reinforcement on the expanded material such as a tubular profile is to assemble one or more layers of the expanded material of the same or different structure with the reinforcement on a core and bake the assembly at an elevated temperature. The reinforcement can be positioned on the outside surface inside surface or combinations thereof. The connecting material can be optionally utilized to hold the components together. Upon cooling the core is removed.

The end or ends of the reinforcement can be optionally blunted welded looped or otherwise adapted to prevent snagging scratching penetrating or other damage to the supporting member or any other object with a blunt end . Alternatively there can be for example loops rings e.g. eyelets or other blunted objects fabricated on the end or ends of reinforcement . The blunted ends can also be utilized as gripping locations for placing the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof in axial circumferential or multi axial tension or compression. Axial circumferential or multi axial tension or compression can be utilized to reduce or increase the size of the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof so that they can be inserted having enough clearance with the supporting member . When the reinforcement is spring loaded the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof can return partially or fully to their original or predetermined size or range of sizes and or shapes when the tension or compression is removed.

Although not shown the reinforcement or expanded material can optionally contain somewhat sharp edges that grip the supporting member or other nearby structures upon being located in their final position. The sharp edges are capable of preventing the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof from substantially moving out of the desired position upon locating. The reinforcement expanded material or combinations thereof can also optionally contain screens filters or hooks to collect debris in the contents . The reinforcement can for example serve as a blood clot filter.

The reinforcement can also optionally be a partially or fully hollow structure. The hollow reinforcement can be filled with any gas liquid or solid. The hollow reinforcement for example can be optionally filled with additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as active ingredients to provide structure to the expanded material while simultaneously delivering active ingredients such as one or more medications. When implanted these additives nano size articles or combinations thereof such as the active ingredients in the hollow space can for example be optionally delivered by releasing migrating eluting emitting diffusing dissolving leaching reacting associating or combinations thereof through for example the voids . The delivery is for example immediate release modified release sustained release extended release or combinations thereof. The delivery is for example constant ascending descending or changing rate into the patient or other surroundings.

Any natural or synthetic material that can be converted into a sufficiently strong strand arrangement bead wire wall thickness member strut fiber filament or yarn is suitable for the fabrication of the reinforcement of the present invention so long as it meets the requirements of the end use application. The strand arrangement bead wire member strut fiber filament wall thickness or yarn can be optionally further processed into a variety of configurations such as woven fabric non woven knitted straight spiral coil serpentine curved zigzagged mesh lattice random orientation loops mat foam lattice twisted braided mesh or combination thereof to name a few.

It is preferred that the reinforcement is comprised of a formable composite that includes a plurality of deformable elements that are partially or fully interconnected as shown in or encapsulated as shown in with one or more binders . The binder optionally includes additives nano size articles or combinations thereof. The binder partially or fully holds the deformable elements substantially together as a pair or group of deformable elements . The deformable elements can be in the range of 0 99 volume percent of the formable composite . The deformable elements are preferably a plurality of discontinuous elements. The deformable elements for the most part retain the first size and shape until after deformation or self expansion wherein they retain the second size shape. Having a reinforcement comprised of a formable composite provides substantially superior flexibility and less drag against the supporting member during installation when compared to the prior art reinforcements which are generally manufactured of a single metallic material. The reinforcement made of a formable composite is manufactured for example by injection molding extrusion EDM laser weaving stamping melt spinning electrospinning or any other process capable of producing the configurations described herein.

Therefore the connecting material of the present invention can provide structure to the material as well as adhesion or an attachment mechanism.

If necessary the surface of the supporting member is optionally adapted to deliver a good surface size shape or combinations thereof for adhesion or attachment between the supporting member and the expanded material reinforcement connecting material or combinations thereof. For example the surface of supporting member can be abraded cleaned sized or adapted with additives nano size articles or coverings . Other surface treatments known by those skilled in the art of adhesion are also suitable in the present invention. It is also possible to perform angioplasty on the supporting member prior to during or after positioning the expanded material reinforcement or combinations thereof.

The expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet expanded fiber reinforcement connecting material additives nano size articles supporting member covering or combinations thereof can be individually or collectively sterilized. The assembly or the individual parts can be for example subjected to radiation sterilization elevated temperature treated with ethylene oxide etc. In addition the assembly and its components can be optionally manufactured in a clean room environment that utilizes high efficiency filtration and other practices know by those skilled in the art of clean rooms.

The trade off in doing this however is producing a less consistent product at a higher cost of manufacture due to wasted raw materials less uniform administration of active ingredients when applicable less consistent delivery of active ingredients and use of larger manufacturing facilities with more energy consumption. It is also possible in some cases like when using fibers in the present invention to use polymer processed by melt spinning or electrospinning.

It is anticipated within the scope of the present invention that the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet expanded fiber or combinations thereof can serve as a protective surface on any substrate instead of coatings or in conjunction with coatings that are presently used. For example siding on a home or a floor can include at least one layer of the expanded material of the present invention to extend its useful life. Furthermore sheet metal used to form body panels hoods trunk lids or other stamped or formed components on automobiles or other equipment can include at least one layer of the expanded material of the present invention to extend its useful life and or appearance. The expanded material can be applied before during or after a part is formed. The expanded material can also be utilized as a mold release for stamping casting or molding parts. In addition the expanded material can be used as a pipe liner or to reline used corroded or leaking pipes. The most preferred expanded material used for lining pipes includes abrasion resisting additives nano size articles or combinations thereof.

Positioning the expanded material on the outside surface of the supporting member such as a steel pipe is beneficial in highly corrosive atmospheres because it can extend service life. Furthermore in contrast to a coating it provides a more environmentally sound solution to extending service life since volatile organic chemicals VOC that are common in coatings are minimized if not entirely eliminated. Moreover the expanded material can include or be impregnated with the previously mentioned additives nano size articles or combinations thereof that enhance adhesion corrosion resistance pigmentation or UV stability. The present invention offers superior UV light protection therefore significantly reducing external cracking fading and other deterioration of the outside surface. When the expanded material of the present invention is utilized in a structural support an applied expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet expanded fiber or combinations thereof can extend the structural integrity in a fire especially when adapted with optional flame retardants.

The following examples are presented to more particularly illustrate our invention and are not to be construed as limitations thereon.

A thin wall cylindrical shaped expanded tubular profile having a diameter of approximately 6 mm and a wall thickness of approximately 0.10 mm made of two layers of expanded material comprising polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material having a structure including fibrils and voids that includes a plurality of glass nano fibers and nano size silicon dioxide crystals is converted into a prosthesis for a medical application. The fibrils of the expanded material have a mean length in the range of about 15 25 microns. The prosthesis is used as a coronary artery bypass graft CABG in a medical procedure. The prosthesis includes a microencapsulated active ingredient positioned between the two layers of expanded material that is delivered to the patient after installation over a period of 90 days in a descending rate to minimize the rejection of the prosthesis in the human body. Other examples were produced in diameters ranging in size from about 0.5 mm to 60 mm and wall thicknesses ranging in size from about 0.05 mm to 0.3 mm.

A cylindrical shaped reinforcement having a diameter of 6 mm is comprised of a wall thickness having a plurality of rectangular shaped open cells surrounded by member segments having a rectangular cross section. The member segments having a thickness of about 0.0762 mm 0.003 inches near the first and second ends and about 0.127 mm 0.005 inches near middle are made of a formable composite including a plurality of deformable elements encapsulated in a binder of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE . Samples are produced using discontinuous deformable elements made of stainless steel and Nitinol . Samples are produced wherein the deformable elements range in size from 10 to 500 the length of the member segments. Samples are produced wherein the ratio of first size to second size ranges from about 1 2 to 1 10. Other samples are prepared for neurological applications having a diameter of about 2 mm and larger sizes like 30 mm for placement in aorta. The reinforcements are coated with an non erodible covering containing an immunosuppressive and antiplatelet agents.

The cylindrical shaped prostheses are inserted into various blood carrying passageways of patients by non invasive surgery techniques using a catheter. There is sufficient clearance between the prostheses and the passageways. The samples containing the stainless steel deformable elements are dilated from a first size and shape to a second size and shape with a balloon catheter until the outside surfaces of the reinforcements are in substantial contact with the interior wall of the blood carrying passageways. The samples containing the Nitinol g deformable elements are dilated from first size and shape to second size and shape by removing a constraint that temporarily maintained the reinforcement in a reduced size. The shape memory of the Nitinol deformable elements enable the reinforcements to be self expanding so that they expand from a smaller first size to the larger second size so that the outside surface of the reinforcement is in substantial contact with the inside surface of the blood carrying passageway. The dilated reinforcements prop open the passageways enabling blood to freely flow through its bore with a substantially normal pressure drop.

Other embodiments are prepared using a binder of perfluoroelastomers FFKM Kalrez available from DuPont perfluoroelastomers FKM Viton available from DuPont polyethylene polypropylene polyester silicone urethane polyamides bioabsorbable materials and Sorona available from DuPont .

The expanded materials of Example 1 are combined with the reinforcements of Example 2 to produce stent grafts. The stent grafts are surgically implanted in a human body blood carrying passageway to repair an aneurismal vessel.

The expanded material of the present invention can be made in a continuous process or a batch process. A batch process divides the manufacturing processes described into separate processes or groups of processes. It is advantageous for example to use a batch process when the processing rates of the upstream steps do not equal the rate of the downstream steps. Of course in a continuous process differing rates can also be compensated for by storing partially manufactured products during the process.

Any solvent capable of being combined with the material that is capable of forming a mixture paste slurry dispersion solution damp powder composition or combinations thereof is suitable in the present invention. Without intent on limiting the preferred solvents of the present invention include acetone paraffin oil decalin or dacahydronaphthlene dodecane xylene toluene trichlorobenzene tetralin cycloalkane cycloalkene carene fluorene camphene menthane dipentene naphthalen acenaphthene methylcyclopentadien tricyclodecane 1 2 4 5 tetramethyl 1 1 4cyclohexadiene fluorenone naphthindane tetramethyl p benzodiquinone ethylfluorene fluoranthene naphthenone glycols mineral spirits kerosene naptha chlorinated hydrocarbons chlorofluorinated hydrocarbons pentane hexane heptane toluene methylene chloride carbon tetrachloride trichlorotrifluoroethane TCTFE diethyle ether ethanol ether acetone cyclohexanone 2 methylpentanone dichloromethane n hexane heptane diethyl ether dioxane and their derivatives and or mixtures are examples of suitable solvents

Any extruder is useful in the process of the present invention so long as it is capable of converting the material to be expanded into the unexpanded tubular profile or other shape. It is however preferred to carefully control the ratio of solvent and material temperature and extrudate flow rate. It is also important to manage air entrainment bubbles lumps and the like carefully in the previously mentioned solution paste slurry damp powder composition mixture etc. before during and after extrusion. As known by those skilled in the art of extrusion the extruder can optionally include screw s ram die pump and controls. It is also preferable to have an optional adjustable die to make fine adjustments in the unexpanded tubular profile s wall thickness and uniformity.

In the process of the present invention one or more orifices can be optionally utilized to produce a single or multiple unexpanded tubular profiles . These orifices optionally contain at least partially tapered sections preferably with optional temperature control. The multiple orifices optionally can extrude the same or different materials .

Additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can also be previously compounded with material to be converted into the expanded material for the convenience of handling fewer raw materials. Alternatively the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be included in the material to be expanded during polymerization of the material . The incorporation of the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof during polymerization of the material can provide a more homogeneous distribution of the additives nano size articles or combinations thereof in the material .

As shown in the optional solvent is removed from the unexpanded tubular profile upon exiting the extruder in extraction device . The solvent can be removed by any means such as elevated or reduced temperature ventilation use of a second solvent or any combinations of the preceding. Alternatively the removal of the solvent can also occur at the middle or at the end of the conversion process.

The unexpanded tubular profile or expanded tubular profile can be optionally partially or fully calendered or sintered after extrusion. Moreover calendaring and sintering can occur before or after stretching.

The unexpanded tubular profile enters a temperature controlled area by optional puller A. Another optional puller or support not shown located inside the bore of the tubular profile can augment the feeding or stretching process. Depending on the choice of material the pullers can be optionally temperature controlled or contain gripping devices to facilitate the stretching process. Furthermore the pullers can be designed so that they do not damage the expanded material during stretching. Moreover the pullers can optionally move axially e.g. in the machine direction or rotate as needed to accommodate the stretching process.

In the temperature controlled area the unexpanded tubular profile is stretched or drawn either axially circumferentially or both. For example the unexpanded tubular profile is stretched from first length L to second length L from first diameter D to second diameter D or both. One method of stretching the unexpanded tubular profile axially is to have the puller B advance the unexpanded tubular profile at a faster rate than the puller A. The unexpanded tubular profile or the expanded tubular profile can be optionally flattened during axial stretching. Care should be taken not to crease the edges of the expanded tubular profile if a crease would interfere with the end use application.

In the temperature controlled area the temperature during stretching is preferably elevated to facilitate expansion. The preferred temperature can be experimentally determined for each material to meet the requirements of the end use application. Without intent on limiting the elevated temperature can be optionally achieved through for example the use of a bath containing liquid salt bath liquid spray nozzles a gas stream running transverse to the extrudate radiant heater steam hot roll hot chamber or any other suitable methods for modifying the temperature of the unexpanded tubular profile as it is expanded.

The unexpanded tubular profile can be expanded circumferentially in temperature controlled area in any way that produces a relatively precise expansion of first diameter D to second diameter D. An uneven expansion of diameter or an unconstrained expansion will result in an inconsistent product. As previously mentioned an inconsistent product has varying thickness molecular orientation structure density porosity fibril size node size strength permeability specific gravity and so on.

Upon expansion from the first diameter D to the second diameter D the expanded tubular profile is optionally fed or pulled into thermal treatment zone in its expanded state. The temperature in the thermal treatment zone can be experimentally determined so that it substantially maintains the expanded structure of the expanded tubular profile . In the thermal treatment zone the structure of the expanded material created by stretching is locked in frozen or made substantially permanent.

After thermal treating the expanded tubular profile it is cooled and stored. The expanded tubular profile can be stored in stick or coiled configuration. Furthermore the expanded tubular profile can be slit and stored in a expanded sheet or the expanded fiber configuration. The expanded sheet or expanded fiber can be stored in a roll. As previously mentioned the expanded material such as the expanded tubular profile expanded sheet or expanded fiber can be further processed by flattening densification lamination covering adapted with additives or nano size articles or otherwise converting into its end use product. These subsequent processes can be achieved in a continuous or batch processes.

Referring to which illustrates another more detailed side view of a process for manufacturing the present invention the unexpanded tubular profile enters temperature controlled area A and is stretched from first length L to second length L. Having axial stretching preceding circumferential stretching reduces the specific gravity and or wall thickness of the expanded material and can make subsequent circumferential stretching easier. Next the once stretched expanded tubular profile is stretched from first diameter D to second diameter D in temperature controlled area B. The once expanded tubular profile is stretched in any way that increases its diameter from first diameter D to second diameter D in a relatively precise manner. To achieve a uniformly expanded tubular profile the second diameter D or subsequent diameters should preferably not have variation more than about 200 percent more preferably less than the range of about 0 50 percent and most preferably less than the range of about 0 15 percent of the outside diameter of the expanded tubular profile along its length from first end to second end .

To achieve uniform circumferential stretching it is possible to use the optional mandrel as shown in in side view and in front view that stretches the unexpanded tubular profile or the expanded tubular profile from first diameter D to second diameter D. The mandrel is preferably mounted so that it is positioned in the bore of the expanded tubular profile . The mandrel is optionally tapered or otherwise configured to stretch the expanded tubular profile from first diameter D to second diameter D as the expanded tubular profile passes over it. Furthermore the mandrel is optionally temperature controlled for example at an elevated or lower temperature to facilitate expansion. As shown in which is a side view of one embodiment of the mandrel the tapered mandrel optionally has a first diameter of D on leading edge and a second diameter of D on trailing edge . The mandrel stretches the expanded tubular profile by imparting an internal force on the bore of the expanded tubular profile . The mandrel stretches the expanded tubular profile uniformly because it is relatively precisely stretched from first diameter D to second diameter D. The mandrel can be optionally polished or adapted with a substantially non stick surface lubricants or any other means that reduce the friction between inside surface and mandrel . The mandrel can also be optionally porous or contain a plurality of holes so that fluids steam or gases can be introduced between bore and the outside surface of the mandrel . Lubricants can also be optionally introduced by atomizers. It is also possible to have the mandrel vibrate to impede adhesion. By pulling the expanded tubular profile over the mandrel it is common to also experience some axial stretching because the wall thickness is usually in tension axially.

Referring to the mandrel can optionally be any expandable device capable of stretching the unexpanded tubular profile or expanded tubular profile from first diameter D to second diameter D. It can for example optionally contain a plurality of overlapping tabs around its circumference between leading edge and trailing edge . The overlapping tabs allow the mandrel to adjust from first diameter D to second diameter D in an incremental manner. To avoid the wall thickness of the expanded tubular profile from breaking or tearing due to an abrupt change in diameter the overlapping tabs permit the mandrel to increase from first diameter D to second diameter D gradually until the process arrives at a steady state. The actual rate and degree of unfolding of the tabs is experimentally determined for each unique material and process conditions. The mandrel can also optionally be an inflatable device. Differences in diameter wall thickness amount of stretch rate of stretch require a different set of process conditions.

As shown in in the thermal treatment zone the expanded tubular profile is optionally conveyed over a barrel which is any means that substantially maintains the expanded tubular profile in its approximate expanded size. The barrel partially or fully prevents the expanded tubular profile from shrinking back to its original size by serving as a constraint on the bore . The barrel can be optionally temperature controlled for example at an elevated temperature. Furthermore the barrel can be optionally polished have a substantially non stick coating or employ a lubricant to facilitate conveying the expanded tubular profile over the barrel with minimal to no friction. It is also possible that the barrel be a porous material or contain a plurality of holes so that hot air or steam or any lubricating material can be fed through the barrel s outside surface to reduce friction between expanded tubular profile s inside surface and the barrel . Lubricants can also be optionally introduced with atomizers. The optional hot air lubricant or steam exiting the barrel can also facilitate in the thermal treatment process. It is also possible to have the barrel vibrate to impede adhesion between the barrel and the expanded tubular profile . In the thermal treatment zone any remaining solvents can also be substantially removed. It is alternatively possible to keep the expanded tubular profile in expanded state through internal pressurization or a vacuum.

Once again referring to the unexpanded tubular profile of the present invention can also be optionally expanded circumferentially by pressurizing the bore in the section between about puller C and about before puller B preferably in the region of about temperature controlled area B. One or more pullers can optionally temporarily or fully collapse or flatten the tubular profile to create a partial or full seal which is one way of enabling pressurization during processing. An optional material can be temporarily or permanently introduced to the bore to prevent the top wall thickness from permanently adhering to the bottom wall thickness and facilitate sealing. To ensure substantially uniform expansion when pressurizing the bore the wall thickness of expanded tubular profile is stretched circumferentially from first diameter D to second diameter D so that is grows in diameter up until it reaches a constraint which limits expansion as it advances through the process. The constraint limits the amount of stretching thereby delivering a uniformly stretched expanded material .

The constraint can be optionally temperature controlled at an elevated or reduced temperature. The constraint can also be optionally polished or adapted with a substantially non stick surface lubricants or any other means that reduces the friction between the outside surface and the constraint . Lubricating materials can also be optionally introduced through atomizers. Furthermore the constraint can also be optionally porous or contain a plurality of holes so that fluids steam or gases can be introduced between outside surface and constraint . It is also optionally possible to have the constraint vibrate to impede adhesion.

As shown in one or more optional support seals or internal pressure maintains the expanded tubular profile at a relatively constant expanded diameter after stretching. The optional support seal and optional internal pressure maintain a relatively open bore and prevents the expanded tubular profile from collapsing or sagging while processing. Optionally transferring the expanded tubular profile through an liquid filled tank or bath can also assist a gas or liquid filled bore from sagging by allowing it to more or less float through the process. Any gas or liquid can be used for pressurization.

It is also possible to use a combination of mandrel and internal pressurization to achieve circumferential stretching.

As shown in the process of the present invention can contain multiple stretching steps that are circumferential axial or combinations thereof. Without intent on limiting the expanded material can be manufactured by for example stretching axially circumferentially axially circumferentially axially axially axially circumferentially circumferentially circumferentially axially circumferentially circumferentially circumferentially circumferentially to illustrate a few of the possible combinations. In fact the process of the present invention can have an infinite amount of stretching steps of any combination or be in any orientation required to meet the requirements of the end use application or facilities. Furthermore the process of the present invention can have any amount of stretch or rate of stretch in an infinite amount of combinations up to the point of substantially breaking the wall thickness . Like the composition structure and dimensions of the expanded material of the present invention the process of the present invention is very flexible and can be adapted to meet the requirements of the end use application. Moreover the process can be oriented horizontally as shown or vertically as not shown .

To further demonstrate the flexibility of the process of the present invention shows that the optional solvent can be extracted from the expanded material at the end of the process in the extraction device and that stretching can occur with the solvent partially or fully present in the wall thickness of the expanded material . Moreover the process can be optionally adapted to include an agitator in blend tank an intensive mix tank a quench tank or an air gap after the extruder . The process can also include an adaptation zone . also shows that multiple temperature controlled areas A B and C where multiple stages of stretching or expansion takes place are possible. In fact there can be an infinite number of temperature controlled areas where stretching takes place in the present invention.

Although the figures illustrate the use of a continuous process to manufacture the present invention it is often more practical to perform each step or group of steps of the process separately or in a batch process. A batch process provides the most flexibility for producing many structures to satisfy the large variety of end use applications previously mentioned. A continuous process is most useful when manufacturing relatively long runs of the expanded material that have substantially the same specifications.

An off line or batch process is also preferred when at least one of the down stream processes operates at a different rate than an upstream process. For example if the rate of stretching exceeds the rate of extrusion. A batch process can include at least one or more of the following sub processes polymerization compounding blending mixing extrusion quenching sintering calendaring extraction heating cooling coating stretching thermal treatment densification assembly reinforcement lamination surface modification or other forms of adaptation.

It is possible in the present invention to pre assemble or nest multiple unexpanded tubular profiles or expanded tubular profiles for example of different diameters and then run the assembly through the process of stretching either axially circumferentially or both. The assembly process can be accomplished in line for example by co extruding or off line by sliding one unexpanded tubular profile into the bore of another unexpanded tubular profile manually. These multiple unexpanded tubular profiles can be optionally connected to one another before or after processing. The multiple wall thicknesses can also be optionally partially or fully calendered sintered or combinations thereof before stretching.

To achieve a uniformly expanded product it is also important to have control over the previously described process. Those skilled in the art of process engineering can experimentally determine using the guide in this specification the proper equipment such as pullers motors valves heaters control systems and so on to achieve relatively precise stretching from first diameter D to second diameter D and or from first length L to second length L when employing the process of the present invention.

Optionally the expanded tubular profile can be further modified in adaptation zone by being partially or fully densified covered laminated slit surface modified or impregnated etc. Furthermore the surface treatment or undercuts on outside surface or inside surface are optionally included.

It has been recently discovered that the expanded material can also be manufactured of any material that includes a plurality of voids inclusions imperfections or combinations thereof by stretching the material while at an elevated temperature. It is preferred to heat the wall thickness to around the melting point of the material or to a temperature that lowers the tensile strength of the material so that it yields in tension. Under these conditions it is also possible to produce the expanded material that includes fibrils voids nodes or combinations thereof.

The expanded material can also be formed of a material comprised of a plurality of fine polymer particles having a different polymer on the core than on the outside shell. For example the polymer comprising the core can have a higher melting point than the polymer comprising the outside shell. Therefore when these particles are stretched in the presence of an elevated temperature solvent or combinations thereof the fibrils are formed by stretching the at least partially melted or softened outside shell. It is also possible to form an expanded material from polymer particles that have a more soluble outside shell than the core. When these particles are stretched in the presence of an elevated temperature solvent or combinations thereof the fibrils are also formed by stretching the at least partially melted or softened outside shell.

Especially useful polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material copolymers include the following 1 copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and ethylene 2 copolymers tetrafluoroethylene and chlorotrifluoroethylene 3 copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoroporpylene. It is also preferred to use polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE that is known in the art as a fine powder and most preferably a relatively highly crystalline form.

Additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can also be optionally incorporated into the polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material during polymerization or through compounding. Very small additives such as nano size articles can be optionally predispersed for example in one or more of the monomers during polymerization or in the solvent prior to blending to facilitate handling.

As illustrated in the polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material is stored in silo A and it is combined with a solvent also known as liquid lubricant extrusion aid etc. stored in silo B and mixed in blend tank to form a paste. It is recommended that the polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material is stored in a temperature controlled environment. Optionally the previously mentioned additives nano size articles or combinations thereof are stored in silo C or in additional storage locations if necessary and combined with polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material and solvent. To improve handling of small size additives like nano articles it is helpful to predisperse the nano size articles in a solvent or liquid prior to blending. It is useful to employ any solvent capable of enabling extrusion in the present invention. Hydrocarbon solvents are preferred and most preferred solvents are mineral spirits kerosene and naphtha. Although it is not preferred and can sometimes produce lower quality results it is also within the scope of the present invention to utilize thermoplastic or melt process able polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE or dispersions of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE with or without solvents.

The polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material and solvent paste or damp powder is formed into one of the previously mentioned tubular shapes with any extruder capable of forming an unexpanded tubular profile .

Optionally the polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material the paste or damp powder is compressed into a cylindrical pre form slug and placed into a ram type extruder. Under high pressure the composition is forced through a finishing die to produce an extrudate or unexpanded tubular profile . The unexpanded tubular profile can be unsintered partially sintered or fully sintered. Sintering can occur in the temperature range of about 300 to 400 C. 572 to 752 F. to increase the specific gravity of the extrudate up to a maximum of about 2.2 if fully sintered when using polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE without additives. Furthermore the extrudate of unexpanded tubular profile can be optionally calendered prior to or after stretching. When calendering the unexpanded tubular profile its specific gravity of the unexpanded tubular profile can be increased up to about 2.2 when using polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE without additives.

The polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material can optionally be co extruded with the same or dissimilar material by feeding the supplemental material or materials through the axis of the extruder.

The solvent is removed from the unexpanded tubular profile in extraction device preferably by drying or the use of a second solvent. Drying can occur at any temperature but it has been found to be practical to use temperatures for drying in the range of about 100 to 300 C. 212 to 572 F . Upon removal of the solvent the first length L is stretched to a second length L or first diameter D is stretched to second diameter D or both in first temperature controlled area . First temperature controlled area is at any temperature capable of producing one of the previously mentioned structures but preferably between about 100 to 380 C. 148 to 716 F. and more preferably between about 200 to 350 C. 392 to 662 F. and most preferably between about 225 to 325 C. 437 to 617 F. . The length of the temperature controlled area must be sufficiently long to condition the wall thickness at about the specified temperature when taking into consideration the speed of the expanded material as it passes through the temperature controlled area . The difference in first length L and second length L or first diameter D and second diameter D can be any change in dimension up to the point of substantially breaking the wall thickness but preferably between about 0 20 000 and more preferably between about 10 10 000 .

The unexpanded tubular profile can be stretched at any rate up to the point of breaking the wall thickness . To achieve an unbroken fibrous wall thickness as previously described it is preferable to stretch unexpanded tubular profile in the range of about 25 sec to 2000 sec more preferably 50 sec to 750 sec and most preferably 120 sec to 600 sec. The temperature rate and ratio of expansion can be varied to obtain the desired structure and properties of the expanded material necessary for the targeted end use application.

The amount of stretch and the rate of stretch can be experimentally determined using the process conditions described herein to meet the needs of the end use application by those skilled in the art of engineering. These process conditions are dependent on wall thickness temperature and the material being processed.

Next the once stretched expanded tubular profile is optionally held in its approximate stretched condition and it is optionally heated in thermal treatment zone . The expanded tubular profile can be thermal treated at any temperature that substantially retains the structure of the wall thickness that was imparted during stretching. However it is preferred to thermal treat the expanded tubular profile above the melting temperature of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE more preferably at a temperature in the range of about 300 to 400 C. 572 to 752 F. and most preferably in the range of about 325 to 375 C. 617 to 707 F. for a duration sufficiently long that the expanded structure that is created in the article is retained. The once stretched expanded tubular profile can be optionally partially or fully sintered during the thermal treatment stage.

Bent or wavy fibrils are optionally formed by reducing the diameter of the expanded profile to put the fibrils in partial or full compression after stretching but before thermal treatment. Alternatively the processing rate after stretching can be slowed to place the fibrils in a compressed condition before thermal treating.

Referring to the previously mentioned process of stretching the unexpanded tubular profile is adapted to have multiple temperature controlled areas A B and C where stretching of the unexpanded tubular profile or expanded tubular profile occurs. The polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material is stored in silo A and combined with the solvent stored in silo B and mixed in blend tank with optional agitator to form a paste. The paste is converted into an unexpanded tubular profile in the extruder .

The unexpanded tubular profile is stretched from first length L to second length L and or first diameter D to second diameter D in first temperature controlled area A. The optional puller B feeds the partially expanded tubular profile of second length L and or second diameter D into the second temperature controlled area B wherein it is stretched from second length L to third length L and or second diameter D to third diameter D . The optional puller C feeds the partially expanded tubular profile of third length L and or third diameter D into the third temperature controlled area C wherein it is stretched from third length L to fourth length L and or from third diameter D to forth diameter D. In the present invention there can be an infinite number of stretching steps of any combination to achieve the desired end use product.

The process of the present invention can have unlimited temperature controlled areas wherein stretching takes places. Moreover there can be one long temperature controlled area wherein the unexpanded tubular profile or partially expanded tubular profile goes through multiple stretching steps. The number of temperature controlled areas and stretching zones are experimentally determined to achieve the requirements of the end use application. Optionally the amount and or rate of stretching can be varied by for example sequentially increasing or decreasing these parameters along with temperature through the multiple stretching processes.

The residual solvent is substantially removed from the unexpanded tubular profile in extraction device . In this example the solvent is extracted at the end of the process but as previously mentioned the solvent can also be extracted prior to stretching or between stretching operations.

The optional thermal treatment step can partially or fully occur at one time at the end of the process after all stretching has occurred or after all or some the stretching steps. Once the thermal treatment or stretching is complete the expanded material is cooled and stored.

To produce an unusually strong expanded material of the present invention crystallizable polymer materials such a polyolefins are preferred polypropylene is more preferred and polyethylene is most preferred. It is also possible for example to use the previously mentioned polymer materials or polymethylpentene 1 polyocymethylene polyvinylidenefluoride polyvinyl alcohol poly acrylonitrile and polyamide nylon . The polymer material can be of any density molecular weight or molecular weight distribution. Preferably the molecular weight of polyethylene material is in the range of about 100 000 to about 10 000 000.

Referring to the polymer material is stored in a silo A and is mixed in blend tank with a first solvent that is stored in silo B. The first solvent is preferably non volatile under process conditions. The preferred first solvent for hydrocarbon polymers are aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Paraffin oil decalin or dacahydronaphthlene dodecane xylene toluene trichlorobenzene tetralin cycloalkane cycloalkene carene fluorene camphene menthane dipentene naphthalen acenaphthene methylcyclopentadien tricyclodecane 1 2 4 5 tetramethyl 1 1 4cyclohexadiene fluorenone naphthindane tetramethyl p benzodiquinone ehtylfluorene fluoranthene naphthenone and their derivatives and or mixtures are examples of suitable solvents.

The polymer material is combined with the solvent in the blend tank at any ratio. Preferably the polymer is dissolved in the solvent. However it is possible to have the polymer undissolved partially dissolved or fully dissolved. For polyethylene in paraffin oil it is preferred to have the polymer in first solvent at a ratio in the range of about 0.05 to 100 weight percent. To obtain a substantially fibril free embodiment it is preferred to have the ratio of polymer to solvent be less than about 15 weight percent polymer. To obtain a substantially void free embodiment it is preferred to use a relatively low level of polymer in solvent in the range of about 5 to 8 weight percent polymer. To obtain a fibril containing embodiment it is preferred to have a higher polymer concentration in the range of about 20 to 100 weight percent polymer. An optional agitator as shown in and or elevated temperature can optionally facilitate dissolving the polymer material in the solvent. It is desirable to sustain the polymer material at a relatively constant concentration to achieve product uniformity. Furthermore it is advantageous to manage air bubbles and or lumps during agitation. For polyethylene material the temperature during the blending or agitation stages is preferably in the range of about 60 to 350 C. 140 to 662 F. more preferably in the range of about 200 to 250 C. 392 to 482 F. . Care should be taken not to degrade the polymer material . Blanketing the blend tank or other process steps with an inert gas like nitrogen or by including antioxidants in the material can prevent polymer degradation.

The previously mentioned additives nano size articles or combinations thereof can be optionally introduced to the blend tank . For ease of handling it is desirable to predisperse them in the solvent compound them in the resin material or incorporate them into the resin material during polymerization.

As shown in the polymer material slurry or solution of blend tank is optionally transferred to an intensive mix tank . The intensive mixer further agitates the polymer material in first solvent. The polymer material slurry or solution is then transferred to an extruder . The extruder conveys the polymer material slurry or solution thru a die that forms an unexpanded tubular profile of indefinite or finite length in any shape. The extruder optionally includes a motor gear pump screw barrel metering pump to deliver the polymer material solution slurry or melt to the die or a plurality of dies at a reasonably controlled rate.

Depending on the embodiment of the present invention the unexpanded tubular profile exits the die under pressure and passes through either an air gap quench tank or extraction device . For polyethylene material nominally the temperature of the extrusion device and the die are in the range of about 100 to 350 C. 212 to 662 F. preferably around about 200 C. 392 F. .

The unexpanded tubular profile exits the die into an air gap . The air gap can be optionally enclosed and filled with an inert gas like nitrogen. In addition the air gap can optionally have temperature control and or cross ventilation to facilitate cooling of the extrudate. The unexpanded tubular profile is optionally stretched axially from first length L to second length L or circumferentially from first diameter D to second diameter D or both when passing through the air gap . The amount of permissible stretching is dependent on the wall thickness of the unexpanded tubular profile temperature of the extrudate and rate of stretch. The upper limit of how much the extrudate can be stretched is up to the point wherein the extrudate breaks. The extrudate for example can be stretched up to and above about 200 1.

From the air gap the unexpanded tubular profile or once stretched expanded tubular profile passes into a quench tank . It is not important how the unexpanded tubular profile is conveyed but pullers or rollers are useful. In the quench tank the temperature of the unexpanded tubular profile or once stretched expanded tubular profile is reduced to a second temperature. The second temperature is sufficiently low to convert the tubular profile in to a gel extrudate. For polyethylene the second temperature is nominally in the range of about 40 C. to 40 C. 40 to 104 F. . The preferred liquid in quench tank is water but a second solvent may be utilized to extract the first solvent.

The partially expanded tubular profile exits the quench tank and enters temperature controlled area A which is at a temperature in a range of about 100 to 160 C. 212 to 320 F. . The partially expanded tubular profile is heated by passing through a temperature controlled area A which is a heated chamber or sleeve for example. The length of the chamber is dependent on the speed of the tubular article passing through it. The faster the speed generally the longer the chamber needs to be. In this stretching process the partially expanded tubular profile is stretched from first length L to second length L or first diameter D to second diameter D or both in a range of about 0.001 1 to 15 1 preferably about 10 1. The upper limit of how much the extrudate can be stretched is up to the point wherein the extrudate breaks. The process is optionally repeated in temperature controlled areas B and C.

From the temperature controlled areas the expanded tubular profile of gel extrudate passes into an extraction device . In the extraction device the first solvent is at least partially replaced with a second solvent. It is preferred to replace the first solvent to less than one percent of the total solvent in the gel extrudate. The second solvent preferably has a low boiling point. When first solvents are hydrocarbons suitable second solvents include for example hydrocarbons chlorinated hydrocarbons chlorofluorinated hydrocarbons and others such as pentane hexane heptane toluene methylene chloride carbon tetrachloride trichlorotrifluoroethane TCTFE diethyle ether ethanol ether acetone cyclohexanone 2 methylpentanone dichloromethane n hexane heptane diethyl ether dioxane dioxane or mixtures thereof. The preferred solvents are methylene chloride and trichlorotrifluoroethane TCTFE . In the extraction device some shrinkage or swelling may occur of the tubular article. Stretching of the gel extrudate in the extraction device is optionally performed. As previously mentioned it is also possible to extract the first solvent in the beginning of or during the process within the scope of the present invention.

Exiting the extraction device the gel extrudate optionally passes through a thermal treatment zone . In the thermal treatment zone the second solvent is removed typically through evaporation. The thermal treatment zone can optionally be under a vacuum to facilitate removal of second solvent. There are numerous methods of drying the expanded tubular profile but utilizing a hot gas like air or nitrogen or a heated cylinder or drum are especially useful in the present invention. Stretching of the expanded tubular profile in the thermal treatment zone is optionally performed.

From the thermal treatment zone the expanded tubular profile is optionally cooled and stored in coil s or cut into straight length s prior to optional additional stretching. This is sometimes desirable because the secondary stretching operation s can operate at a different line speed than the precursor line speed. The secondary stretching processes can for example operate slower.

Fluon V CD 123 polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE powder is mixed in blend tank with mineral spirits at a ratio of about 295 cc per 1 kg 2.2 pounds of powder. The combination is extruded into a cylindrical shaped tubular profile of first inside diameter D of about 1.52 mm 0.06 inches . The unstretched tubular profile is rolled onto a spool for temporary storage.

The unstretched tubular profile is heated to about 315 C. 599 Fahrenheit while stretching from a first length L of about 1 m 39.37 inches to a second length L of about 5 m 196.85 inches at a rate of about 500 sec between two pullers.

The once axially stretched tubular profile is heated again to a temperature of about 315 C. 599 Fahrenheit while stretching to a second inside diameter D of about 3.04 mm 0.12 inches and a wall thickness of 0.10 mm 0.0039 inches at a rate of about 500 sec over a first mandrel mounted inside the bore of the tubular profile.

After stretching the tubular profile its bore is moved over a barrel having its diameter sized to maintain the tubular profile about in its stretched configuration. The barrel is porous and hot air reduces friction between the outside surface of barrel and bore of tubular profile. The double stretched tubular profile is heated to about 365 C. 672.8 Fahrenheit while moving over the barrel.

Upon cooling of the tubular profile that was first axially stretched at a ratio of about 5 1 and second circumferentially stretched at a ratio of about 2 1 is cooled to about 23 C. 73.4 Fahrenheit . The mean fibril length of the expanded material is about 5 microns long in the circumferential direction and about 10 microns in the axial direction.

Using an aqueous dispersion procedure fine powder polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE resin is produced that contains single wall carbon nano tubes that are available from Thomas Swan Co Ltd Crookhall Consett County Durham DH8 7ND UK under the trade name Elicarb . Tetrafluoroethylene is combined with carbon nano tubes having a length from about 0.5 to 3.0 mm and diameter of about 2 nanometers. This combination is stirred in an aqueous medium in the presence of dissolved persulfate polymerization initiator and a dispersing agent under pressure of about 10 to 40 kg cm2. The polymerization reaction is carried out at about 90 140 C. and the polymerization initiator ammonium persulfate is added to the reaction medium until about 65 of the amount of polytetrafluoroethylene has been formed. The resin obtained has an aqueous dispersion of polytetrafluoroethylene particles having a diameter generally within the range of about 0.005 to 400 microns. The dispersion is coagulated by diluting bringing to a pH of 8 to 9 adding ammonium hydroxide and stirring at a temperature in the range of about 20 30 C. until ajelly like mass is produced. The resin is separated and dried for about 18 hours at about 120 C. The polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE resin is converted into expanded material.

The wall thickness is about 15 percent porous because there is some gas air located between the descrete polymer particles. The unexpanded tubular profile is cooled and transferred to a heat chamber where it is reheated to a temperature sufficiently high to remelt the outside surface of each particle while keeping the core of the discrete particles somewhat unmelted.

The wall thickness is about 15 percent porous because there is some gas air located between the descrete polymer particles. The somewhat porous unexpanded tubular profile is cooled and transferred to a heat chamber where it is reheated to a temperature sufficiently high to remelt the very outside surface of each particle while keeping the core of the discrete particles unmelted.

The lab grown vessels having an expanded material backbone serve as a shut enabling multiple punctures without failing. Alternatively the polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material includes carbon nanotubes.

The first end of the expanded tubular profile made of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material including carbon nano tubes is sealed and its bore is filled with an anti cancer drug. Samples are prepared with bevacizumab Avastin and retuximab Erbitux which are effective active ingredients against colon cancer. The second end of expanded tubular profile is sealed to form a suppository. The expanded tubular profile containing these contents has its outside surface coated with a water soluble covering is lubricated and inserted into the rectum of a patient so that it is positioned nearby a cancerous tumor. The anti cancer agents that are active ingredients elute or diffuse through the voids in the wall thickness of the expanded tubular profile dispensing the active ingredients in close proximity of the tumor. The patient s tumor reduces in size more readily due to a higher localized dosage of active ingredients with minimized side effects on the patient vs. an infusion.

An expanded sheet made of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material includes adhesive and active ingredients that are effective in birth control. The active ingredients consist of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol. The combination is converted into a transdermal patch that is applied to the skin of a human patient. The active ingredients elute through the pores in the expanded material into the skin of the patient to provide the correct dosage of active materials to prevent pregnancy. The hydrophobic surface facing away from the patient s skin prevents water from diluting or increasing the dosage. The patch is long lasting requiring less frequent replacements. Furthermore it provides an accurate dosage significantly reducing the risk of overdosage.

An expanded sheet made of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material includes adhesive and an active ingredient that prevents or minimizes the desire to smoke cigarettes. The active ingredient is varenicline tartrate Champix varenicline which is available from Pfizer New York N.Y. USA . The combination is converted into a transdermal patch that is applied to the skin of a human patient. The active ingredient elutes through the highly uniform voids in the expanded material into the skin of the patient to provide the correct dosage of active materials to allow the patients to gradually wean themselves off cigarettes. The patch is long lasting requiring less frequent replacements. Furthermore it provides an accurate dosage significantly reducing the risk of overdosage.

A cylindrical shaped expanded tubular profile made of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE including silicon dioxide nano size crystals that has an inside diameter of about 3.5 mm 0.1378 inches and a length of 33 mm 1.299 inches has a Nitinol reinforcement attached to its outside surface. The reinforcement has a plurality of criss cross members with spaces in between like a lattice. The fabrication of the expanded tubular profile and reinforcement is coated on its luminal and abluminal surfaces with sirolimus available from Wyeth Madison N.J. USA so that the active ingredient is present on the fibrils voids and nodes of the expanded material. The covering is applied by dipping the fabrication in a solution of sirolimus and a binder comprised of a combination of polyethylene co vinyl acetate PEVA and poly n butyl methacrylate PBMA . The fabrication is coated and dried until it contains 315 micrograms of sirolimus. The fabrication is restrained so that its outside diameter is reduced by fifty percent 50 . The restrained fabrication is inserted by non invasive surgery utilizing the assistance of a catheter into a human blood carrying vessel. Upon positioning the restrained fabrication in the proximity of an aneurismal vessel the restraint is released and the fabrication expands substantially to a second size and shape. The fabrication takes over for providing a fully operation bore capable of withstanding blood pressure and flow in the area of installation.

A cylindrical shaped expanded tubular profile of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE as in example wherein the Nitinol reinforcement is substituted with a reinforcement made of 316L stainless steel member segments located on bore.

Alternatively the active ingredient is also positioned between layers of PTFE instead on surface.

A stent graft is formed of two tubes of porous expanded material made of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE including titanium dioxide and a mechanically expandable Nitinol reinforcement having member segments forming a lattice. The reinforcement is located between the two wall thicknesses of the expanded material. Prior to assembly the outside surface of the interior tube of expanded material is coated with an anti clotting active ingredient heparin that is available from Celsus Cincinnati Ohio USA the bore of the exterior tube of expanded material is coated with an immunosuppressive active ingredient paclitaxel Taxol available from Bristol Myers Squibb New York N.J. USA and the reinforcement is coated with an antibiotic active ingredient of trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole TMP SMZ Batrin that is available from Roche Pharmaceuticals Nutley N.J. USA. Sixty percent of the active ingredient is micro encapsulated to provide sustained release over a longer period of time. Furthermore the bore of the interior tube is coated with an anti platelet agent clopidogrel bisulfate Plavix which is available from Bristo Meyers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals. The first end and second end of the tubular profiles are substantially sealed closed to encapsulate the reinforcement and active ingredients.

The reinforcement has a first diameter that is approximately fifty percent 50 smaller that the second diameter of the expanded tubular profiles. The excess circumference of the expanded tubular profiles is folded over and temporarily secured in place during assembly of the stent graft.

The fabrication is inserted through a main artery in the groin femoral artery in a patient through noninvasive surgery utilizing a catheter. The fabrication is flexible and able to conform to the curvature of the artery. When in position the fabrication is dilated by removal or a constraint that allows the shape memory Nitinol g wire to expand the stent graft to the optimum diameter to permit sufficient blood flow without restriction. Once dilated the expanded tubular profiles unfold to grow in circumference with the second size of the reinforcement. The sirolimus and heparin elute or diffuse into the proximity of the installed position through the voids in the wall thickness of the expanded material. The clopidogrel bisulfate assists in preventing blood clotting.

The inside and outside surfaces of a metallic stent are covered with two tubes of expanded material having a wall thickness of about 0.08 mm. The two tubes of expanded material made of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE cover a 316L stainless steel reinforcement having member segments forming a lattice. The expanded material in between the members of the inner and outer tubes are attached or sealed to fully encapsulate each member of the reinforcement. The excess expanded material that is an interconnection between the pluralities of member segments is partially removed to make holes or pe forations in the two layers of expanded material like in .

The pockets between the tubular profiles are filled with a combination of sirolimus Rapamune available from Wyeth Madison N.J. USA an anti clotting agent heparin that is available from Celsus Cincinnati Ohio USA. The pockets in the expanded material serve as reservoirs to hold the optimum dosage of active ingredients.

The covered stent in a reduced size is inserted through a main artery in the arm brachial artery of a patient through noninvasive surgery utilizing a tiny balloon catheter. The fabrication is flexible and able to conform to the curvature of the artery. Furthermore the fabrication has sufficient strength so that its bore can withstand collapsing when positioned in a location such as a joint like near a movable joint. When in position the fabrication is dilated using a balloon catheter to expand the fabrication to the optimum diameter to permit sufficient blood flow without restriction. The sirolimus and heparin elute or diffuse into the proximity of the installed position over time from the pockets. The endothelial cell grow through the thru holes in the expanded material and line the bore of the covered stent.

Two cylindrical shaped expanded tubular profiles made of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material including carbon nanotubes having a mean fibril length of 20 microns have a cylindrical shaped reinforcement made of Nitinol member segments positioned in between the two wall thicknesses. The reinforcement is coated with an active ingredient that is an immunosuppressive called sirolimus Rapamune that is available from Wyeth Madison N.J. USA. The space between the two wall thicknesses is filled with two active ingredients that are an anti clotting agent heparin that is available from Celsus Cincinnati Ohio USA and an anti platelet agent clopidogrel bisulfate Plavix which is available from Bristol Meyers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals. The first end and second end are substantially sealed closed to encapsulate the reinforcement and active ingredients. The fabrication is utilized as a stent graft in a human body.

The stent graft is constrained in first size and inserted into an artery just below the back of the knee of a human body with a catheter. The stent graft assumes the curvature of the artery and the bore of the stent graft opens to its second diameter once the constraint is removed. The bore remains substantially open when the knee is straight and flexed. The active ingredients elute or diffuse through the voids in the wall of the expanded material into the localized area of the installation. Moreover the active ingredients minimize the risk of rejection of the stent graft by the human body and minimize the risk of blood clotting. Since the active ingredients are encased by the two wall thicknesses there is no possibility of a coating flaking off into the blood stream.

Expanded tubular profiles having approximate dimensions ranging in size from about 2.5 to 30 mm inside diameter and 8 to 60 mm in length which are made of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE including a plurality of discontinuous stainless steel fibers positioned substantially within the wall thickness is coated with approximately 70 micrograms sirolimus. The diameters of the expanded tubular profiles are temporarily reduced in size by 20 until deployment by pleating their wall thicknesses like the example shown in . The one piece stent grafts are sterilized with ethylene oxide gas during the manufacturing process and sealed in a f oil package. Examples are produced having stainless steel fibers having a length of 0.5 0.75 1 2 5 and combinations thereof times the diameter of the tubular profiles.

A catheter is rinsed with sterile heparinized normal saline solution HepNS . In addition the guidewire lumen is flushed with HepNS. The inflation device is prepared with diluted contrast medium. The lesion is predilated with a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty PTCA catheter. One expanded tubular profile is advanced over the guidewire to the target lesion. Radiopaque balloon markers are used to position the one piece stent graft across a lesion. Angiography is performed to confirm position of the one piece stent graft.

The inflation device is attached and controlled via a 3 way stopcock. The inflation device is inflated for about 10 seconds under fluoroscopic visualization to a pressure sufficiently high enough below about 1500 kPa to place the expanded tubular profile in full contact with the artery or up to about 2.5 mm. Since the lesion is not fully covered a second one piece stent graft is positioned by repeating the process taking care to sufficiently overlap the expanded tubular profiles. The balloon is deflated by pulling a vacuum on the inflation device and the catheter is removed. The bores of the one piece stent grafts stay substantially dilated after removal of the expansion device without the use of a separate metallic stent. Alternative samples are made substituting the stainless steel fibers with Nitinol and tantalum alloy fibers.

The patient is administered clopidogrel bisulfate Plavix which is available from Bristol Myers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals or ticlopidine Ticlid which is available from Roche Pharmaceuticals during pre and post procedure. In addition the patient is administered aspirin to reduce the risk of thrombosis.

A stent is produced from a 5 mm diameter expanded tubular profile made of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE that includes a combination of stainless steel fibers and carbon nano tubes. Six thru holes having a rectangular shape are cut from the wall thickness around the circumference of the tube and repeated down the length of the tube to form a perforated tube like the example shown in . The perforated tube is coated with fluorinated ethylene propylene FEP and wrapped with expanded sheet. The assembly is thermally cured to substantially connect the perforated expanded tubular profile to the expanded sheet. There are folds in expanded sheet enabling dilation to a larger size. The assembly is coated with 10 micrograms of sirolimus and polymers of PEVA and PBMA at a ratio of about 70 percent polymer and 30 percent sirolimus. The assembly is inserted into a blood vessel of a human patient and dilated from first size of 5 mm to second size of 30 mm to repair an aneurismal vessel. The bore of the expanded tubular profile stays open and in proper position after it is installed without the aid of a separate or attached metallic stent. Additional samples are produced without the expanded sheet covering the perforated tubular profile to form just a stent.

Two expanded tubular profiles made of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE material including glass nano fibers are densified using a combination of elevated temperature and compression. The outside surface of the first tube and the inside surface of the second tube are treated to increase adhesion. The outside surface of the first expanded tubular profile is covered with randomly oriented and inter tangled carbon fibers that are impregnated with a curable epoxy fluorinated ethylene propylene FEP or urethane connecting member. The second expanded tubular profile is slid over the first expanded tubular profile so that the combination of the carbon fiber and connecting member are located between the two profiles. The first ends and second ends of the two profiles are substantially sealed together to encapsulate the connecting member and carbon fiber between the two profiles.

The fabrication is reduced in size by pleating like in and inserted into a lumen using a flexible shaft balloon catheter to repair an aneurismal vessel in a curved lumen using radiopaque markers to assist in positioning. The balloon expansion device is enlarged to dilate the bore of the fabrication so that the bore of the fabrication is sized to provide substantially the same diameter and curvature required to provide a relatively smooth and unrestricted transition from the healthy lumen leading into and out of the fabrication. In addition the fabrication s wall thickness is sufficiently compressed against the bore of the host lumen to create a seal that substantially prevents flow around the fabrication. If necessary the fabrication is anchored to the host lumen to prevent movement.

The connecting member encapsulated between the two expanded tubular profiles is cured after final positioning sizing and shaping using thermal treatment radiation moisture or U.V. light. The balloon catheter is unpressurized and the catheter is removed.

The custom fit graft remains in position resisting kinking and allowing the blood contents to flow through the bore. The abrasion resistant graft provides pressure carrying service between the healthy lumens and thereby taking the host vessel in the area of the aneurism out of service. The cured resin containing carbon fibers sustains the fabrication in desired configuration without the use of a metallic stent.

Additional samples are produced wherein 1 the connecting member is partially cured before insertion and completely cured when in final position 2 the connecting member is substantially flexible after curing 3 the connecting member is substantially inflexible after curing 4 the connecting member does not include fibers 5 the expanded material is sufficiently translucent allowing the connecting member to be U.V. cured through the expanded material 6 the connecting member is U.V. cured through the voids in the expanded material 7 the outside surface of the inner tube and inside surface of outer tube are treated with plasma or etched to increase adhesion 8 the expanded material is not densified 9 the expanded material excludes glass nano fibers and combinations thereof.

A coil shaped reinforcement is coated with active ingredients that are immunosuppressant and anti clotting agents. The coil shaped reinforcement is covered with expanded material. The expanded material is coated to delay the release of the active ingredients. Once the covering erodes the active ingredients escape elute or diffuse through the voids in the expanded material at a descending rate.
