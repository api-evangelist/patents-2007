The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The invention relates generally to the sampling of moving fluids such as moving airflows and more particularly to a sampling system that extracts samples of a moving fluid passing thereover.

Moving fluids such as airflows frequently must be sampled for a variety of flow monitoring applications. Such sampling may be performed to examine the ambient air for chemical biological and or radiological particulates. Other purposes may include inertial characteristics of the airflows such as provided by pressure measurements.

A typical sampling system incorporates a housing having an inlet formed therein and a pump or fan. The inlet faces directly into the flowstream and the fluid expands into a diffuser before being diverted to a collector. As fluid e.g. air moves over the housing the pump draws the fluid into the housing through the inlet and toward the collector. The inlet and pump may be optimized for an expected set of external flow conditions. In particular the system can be designed for appropriate pump power consumption and pump speeds under the expected fluid flow conditions.

However if the fluid flow speed significantly exceeds the design parameters the Bernoulli effect at the housing s inlet causes backpressure to develop in the housing. Bernoulli s principle concerns the relationship between static and dynamic pressures such that P P u where Prepresents stagnation or total pressure of fluid being at rest P is static pressure parallel to fluid flow is fluid density and u is fluid velocity.

In conventional inlets the velocity decreases as the fluid enters the housing thereby increasing static pressure inside the housing. The difference between the internal housing static pressure and the external static pressure in the ambient stream represents the backpressure. As the backpressure increases within the housing the pump must rotate faster than its design operational levels to draw the moving fluid into the collector. Such continued beyond design operation may yield decreased pump efficiency and increased risk of motor overheating.

Conventional medium collection inlets yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various embodiments mitigate against backpressure inefficiency as well as reduce inlet friction loss. Other various embodiments alternatively or additionally provide for omnidirectional flow receipt within a horizontal plane.

Various exemplary embodiments provide an axisymmetric collection apparatus for receiving a portion of a medium that flows around the apparatus and directing the portion into a collector. The apparatus includes an axisymmetric streamline receiver and a support member. The receiver contains a chamber and at least one opening into the chamber that receives the portion. The support member includes an axisymmetric conduit for directing the portion from the chamber towards the collector.

In various exemplary embodiments the opening has an annular axisymmetric geometry. In alternate embodiments the opening represents a plurality of openings angularly distributed along an exterior surface of the streamline receiver each opening having a finite angular width. The axisymmetric conduit may direct a subportion of the portion to a diversion opening that encompasses an axial centerline of the streamline receiver.

Various exemplary embodiments also provide a planform collection apparatus for receiving a portion of a medium that flows around the apparatus and directing the portion into a collector. The apparatus includes a streamline receiver a support member and a tail stabilizer. The receiver includes upper and lower members that form leading and trailing edges to define a chord.

At least one of the members incorporates along an exterior surface at least one opening that receives the portion. The support member has a conduit that directs the portion from the opening towards the collector. The tail stabilizer may be secured to the streamline receiver for orienting the leading edge into the medium.

In various embodiments the opening includes an interior surface recessed from the exterior surface. In further embodiments the interior surface slants to deepen with the distance from the leading edge. In additional embodiments the opening includes boundary walls that define the varying width and the boundary walls connect to the interior surface.

Conventional inlet designs for fluid sample collection housings are subject to the following limitations First Bernoulli effect backpressure in a housing at off design fluid flowspeeds reduces collection efficiency and may adversely affect pump operational life. Second boundary layer thickness development within the inlet influences fluid flow into the housing. Third an inertial response time for weathervane directional alignment to the fluid flow. Fourth non isokinetic conditions may reduce inlet efficiency. Various exemplary embodiments address these limitations in the conventional configurations.

The passing medium impinges the structure at a leading edge within the flowfield approximately at the joining circumference . An inner under planform provides a surface under which the flowfield passes along the transverse direction. The volume substantially enclosed above by the aeroshell and below by the rim and the planform forms a chamber into which the medium may enter.

The planform may be supported by a cylindrical outer stem substantially parallel to the symmetry axis. A cylindrical inner stem also substantially parallel to the symmetry axis may support the aeroshell . The sterns may be tilted together in association with the symmetry axis in an off vertical direction for reorienting the structure .

As the flowfield passes over and under the structure a flow portion of the medium passes into an annular inlet formed between the rim and the planform into the chamber . The outer and inner stems form an annular channel directing the flow portion from the chamber therethrough.

The aeroshell may be represented geometrically by an upper or top profile having a first radius of curvature. A contiguously assembled surface containing the rim the inlet and the planform may be represented geometrically by a lower or bottom profile having a second radius of curvature. To minimize back pressure within the chamber the structure may enable a higher static pressure below the structure and adjacent the inlet than above the structure. Under the Bernoulli principle then the flowfield velocity over the aeroshell preferably exceeds the velocity under the contiguously assembled surface. Consequently the first radius of curvature may preferably be smaller than the second radius of curvature such that the lower profile appears flatter than the upper profile. The upper and lower profiles are revolved about the symmetry axis to form the axisymmetric structure .

Particulate matter entrained within the flow portion may sweep on downward past the annular inlet into a collector not shown by inertia and drag of the individual particles. The collector may represent a dry filter unit DFU used to detect selectable particulates for chemical or biological analysis. The remaining flow portion may be redirected upward towards a tube formed by the inner stem and ejected from the structure through an outlet . An example streamline traces a path through which an entering portion of the medium may traverse.

As a consequence of the flow paths into the inlet and ejected through the outlet the backpressure equilibrates to the ambient conditions thereby reducing flow inefficiency. Moreover the axisymmetric design of the structure permits medium reception from omnidirectionally within the substantially horizontal flow plane.

The passing medium impinges the structure at a leading edge within the flowfield approximately at the joining circumference . The volume substantially enclosed by the shells forms a chamber into which the medium may enter. In context of the exemplary embodiments described herein the term airfoil denotes a streamline shape within a flowfield in which the medium may preferably be but not limited to atmospheric air.

A cylindrical outer stem parallel to the symmetry axis may support the lower airfoil shell . The stem may be tilted in association with the symmetry axis in an off vertical direction for reorienting the structure . As the flowfield passes over and under the structure a flow portion of the medium passes into at least one annular inlet .

Each inlet may form either a substantially annular opening circumferentially around the symmetry axis . Alternatively each inlet may represent a series of openings into the chamber having finite angular width and being angularly distributed around the symmetry axis .

The inlets may be characterized by an effective radial length dlocally tangent to the structure . The radial length is normal to the flow direction and must be at least equal an absolute velocity v of the flow times a characteristic time constant . The inlets may additionally or in the alternative employ Bernoulli effect principles described further below.

The upper airfoil shell may include an inlet as above described for an annular ring or a series. The lower airfoil shell may include an inlet also as an annular ring or a series. The outer stem may include near its juncture with the lower airfoil shell an inlet also as an annular ring or a series.

As the medium flows around the structure a portion of the flow enters the chamber through the inlets traveling radially inward. A baffle or diverter redirects the flow portion downward into the outer stem towards a tube channel to enter a collector not shown . Example streamlines show the path of the flow portion entering the inlets and diverting to the tube channel for analysis.

The upper and lower shells converge to join along a circumferential rim thereby enclosing a chamber for the structure . present the views of the structure from below and above the rim respectively. The medium can flow from any horizontal direction transverse to the symmetry axis over the upper shell and under the lower shell . The lower shell may be supported by a cylindrical stem and joined circumferentially along a fillet to form a tube parallel to the symmetry axis.

Several inlets may be circumferentially distributed along the lower shell to permit the medium to flow into the chamber . Alternatively the inlets may be circumferentially distributed along the upper shell particularly for collective inclusion of precipitation. Each inlet includes a recessed surface within the chamber . The recessed surface may be substantially perpendicular to the symmetry axis thereby being approximately parallel to streamlines entering the inlet .

The inlet benefits from the Bernoulli effect by employing a narrow shallow opening at an outer radius end and a wide deep opening at an inner radius end . The outer and inner radii refer to structure from the symmetry axis. The widths between these openings may vary linearly or nonlinearly such as the flat Gaussian curve shown. This geometry enables the boundary layer within the inlet to remain substantially uniform thereby reducing pressure losses into the structure . This design opening is labelled a Bernoulli effect inlet herein.

A boundary layer develops along the surface as the medium flows into the inlet . Expansion of the depth and width of the inlet as the medium to flow progressively into the chamber reduces viscous drag losses thereby reducing pressure drop across the inlet as well as turbulence. The medium flows towards the radial center of the structure and turns downward into the tube to enter a collector not shown .

The assembly may further include a tail that orients the assembly to direct the airfoil towards windward by connection to a stiff linkage or rod in the manner of a weathervane. The airfoil may represent cross section planforms documented by the former National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics NACA . Many NACA planforms are bilaterally symmetric across the chord. This embodied configuration is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 134 603 incorporated by reference.

The airfoil provides an upper surface and a lower surface exposed to the medium. At a forward end the surfaces may be joined at a leading edge . Similarly at the aft end the surfaces may be joined at a trailing edge . These surfaces and edges may represent NACA planforms. The leading and trailing edges form a chord of the airfoil .

The system differs from the assembly primarily by employment of Bernoulli effect inlets . shows the inlets on the upper surface although the inlets may also be employed on the lower surface . Each inlet as shown in employs a narrow shallow forward end and a wide deep aft end . The aft end is farther downstream from the leading edge than the forward end .

A portion of the medium that flows over the airfoil may enter the inlet . The portion flows between recessed walls that define the forward and aft ends and along a recessed surface to contain a boundary layer region of the portion. The recessed surface may be substantially parallel to the chord or alternatively may be slanted to provide a deeper channel at the aft end than the forward end . The widths between these ends may vary linearly or nonlinearly such as the flat Gaussian curve shown.

A chute connected downstream i.e. aft of the associated inlet directs the flow portion into a channel within the strut . The chute may join contiguously with the recessed walls and the recessed surface . The channel leads to a conduit into a collector not shown .

A chamber represents interior regions not in communication with the inlet the chute or the channel . Thus in the depicted exemplary version the flow portion does not enter the chamber which may be vented to equilibrate with an appropriate pressure level relative to ambient conditions to maintain structural integrity and or internal chamber pressure for optimal inlet flow performance.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
