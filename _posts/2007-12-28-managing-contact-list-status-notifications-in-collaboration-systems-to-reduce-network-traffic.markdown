The present invention relates to collaboration systems in general and more particularly to managing contact list status notifications.

Collaboration software is an increasingly popular tool that enables computer users to interact in real time using their computers. Some common features of collaboration software include the ability for users to maintain contact lists of other users with whom they collaborate as well as a mechanism for managing the awareness of contact list owners by informing contact list owners of changes in the status of their contact list members such as their availability accessible devices mood activities and other personal attributes. Contact status information is typically provided to collaboration software users in the form of notifications sent by an awareness server that keeps track of the status of contact list members. When a status change occurs for a contact list member a notification of the change in status is sent to the owner of the contact list.

In typical collaboration software configurations notifications of status changes are sent regarding all members of a client s contact list. As a contact list grows more and more status notifications are sent causing an increased load on the awareness server. One way to reduce this load is to limit the size of a user s contact list such as by having the user delete members from or refrain from adding new members to the contact list. However this may cause important contact information to be lost and may restrict future collaboration opportunities thus reducing the utility of collaboration software.

In one aspect of the present invention an awareness notification management system is provided including a contact list manager configured to manage a contact list of an awareness service subscriber the contact list including an active sublist having at least one active contact and an archive sublist having at least one disabled contact and an awareness manager configured to monitor a status of any member of the contact list where the awareness manager is configured to access a history including at least one timestamp of a last communication exchange between the awareness service subscriber and any of the members of the contact list and query the history for any of the timestamps and classify any of the contacts as a disabled contact on the archive sublist if the timestamp for the contact is older than a predefined age and where the awareness manager is configured to forward to the awareness service subscriber awareness notifications regarding the status of the active contacts and withhold from the awareness service subscriber awareness notifications regarding the status of the disabled contacts.

Reference is now made to which is a simplified conceptual illustration of an awareness notification management system constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention and additionally to which is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary method of operation of the system of operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

The system of may be appreciated in the context of the following exemplary operational scenario in which two computers and are configured with data communications client programs and respectively preferably being collaboration software such as Sametime commercially available from International Business Machines Corporation Armonk N.Y. Clients and are preferably configured to communicate with each other via a network such as the Internet. A server preferably includes a contact list manager which manages a contact list such as may be constructed by client . Server also preferably includes an awareness manager which preferably monitors the status of the members of contact list and a history in which awareness manager preferably maintains a timestamp of the last communication exchange between client and the members of contact list to which information server is privy. Contact list is preferably organized into at least two sublists such as an active sublist for active contacts and an archive sublist for disabled contacts as will be explained in greater detail below.

Client sends a request to contact list manager via network and server to retrieve the contents of contact list . Contact list manager sends the contents of contact list which includes both active sublist and archive sublist to client via server and network step . Client is preferably configured to display the sublists of contact list in such a way that members of the different sublists may be easily differentiated such as by displaying the members of the active sublist under an ACTIVE heading and the members of the archive sublist under an ARCHIVE heading. Client is preferably configured to allow the editing of contact list such as by adding a new contact and preferably sends a notification detailing any changes to contact list to contact list manager via server and network . Client preferably sends a request to awareness manager via server and network to monitor the status of the members of contact list and receive awareness notifications regarding changes in the statuses of the members of contact list step . Awareness manager preferably defines the members of contact list as being in one of multiple notification states such as active for members of active sublist and disabled for members of archive sublist . Awareness manager preferably queries history to determine the timestamps of the most recent collaborations between the members of contact list and client step . For example history may be accessed using an application programming interface API such as long getLastCollaboration String user String user to return a timestamp of the most recent collaboration between any given pair of users. It is noted that collaboration between users may include any type of exchange of any type of information between a variety of clients such as email instant messaging IM video or audio to name a few as may be known to server . Awareness manager preferably uses the results obtained by querying history to change the notification state of the members of contact list according to predetermined criteria such as by comparing the timestamp obtained from history of the most recent collaboration of the members of contact list and client with a predefined age value such as one month. For example if the retrieved timestamp for the most recent collaboration between a contact and client is older than the age value then awareness manager preferably sets the notification state of that contact to disabled and places the contact into archive sublist . Awareness manager preferably sends client a message via server and network notifying client that the contact has been disabled step . If the retrieved timestamp for the most recent collaboration between a contact and client is younger than the age value then awareness manager preferably sets the notification state of that contact to active and places the contact into active sublist step . Awareness manager preferably sends client a message via server and network notifying client that the contact is active. Awareness manager preferably forwards only awareness notifications regarding the status of active contacts and therefore appear in active sublist to client step . Thus for example were awareness manager to detect a change in the status of client whose notification state is currently disabled and who therefore appears in archive sublist awareness manager would not send an awareness notification sent by client to client .

At any point client sends a request to awareness manager via network and server to disable an active contact or activate a disabled contact. Upon receiving the request awareness manager changes the notification state of the contact accordingly and preferably sends a notification to client confirming the change. If a disabled contact is activated then awareness manager preferably records the time of the change and updates the timestamp in history to the new time. Additionally client may be enabled to configure the criterion determining the activating or disabling of contact list members and may send the criterion to awareness manager via network and server .

Reference is now made to which is a simplified conceptual illustration of an awareness notification management system constructed and operative in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention and additionally to which is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary method of operation of the system of operative in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The system of is substantially similar to the system of described above with the notable exception that upon determining that a contact should be disabled awareness manager sends client a prompt requesting a confirmation for the change of notification state step . If awareness manager receives an affirmative confirmation from client then awareness manager disables the contact and preferably sends client a notification that the state of the contact has been set to disabled step . If awareness manager does not receive an affirmative confirmation from client then awareness manager does not disable the contact step .

Reference is now made to which is a simplified conceptual illustration of an awareness notification management system constructed and operative in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention and additionally to which is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary method of operation of the system of operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system of is substantially similar to the system of described above with the notable exception that upon sending a request to awareness manager to monitor the status of the members of contact list and forward awareness notifications regarding changes in the statuses of the members of contact list the protocol implemented by client preferably requires an immediate response from awareness manager such as is required by the Session Initiated Protocol SIP . Awareness manager preferably defines an additional pending state for the members of contact list . Upon receiving a subscription from client to monitor the status of and forward awareness notifications sent by the members of contact list awareness manager preferably sets the states of the members of contact list to pending and sends a notification to client via server and network of the current state step . Having satisfied the protocol awareness manager preferably determines the appropriate notification states for the members of contact list using any of the methods described above and notifies client of any subsequent state changes.

Reference is now made to which is a simplified conceptual illustration of an awareness notification management system constructed and operative in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention and additionally to which is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary method of operation of the system of operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system of is substantially similar to the system of described above with the notable exception that in the system of contact list manager contact list active sublist and archive sublist are preferably included in computer . Client retrieves contact list from contact list manager without communicating with awareness manager step . Client sends the contents of contact list or only the contents of active sublist to awareness manager with a request to monitor the status of and receive awareness notifications from the contacts that have been sent step . Awareness manager queries history to determine the appropriate notification state for the sent contacts using the methods described above and sends client a notification of recommended state changes step . Client is preferably enabled to activate or disable contacts using conventional means such as by dragging and dropping contacts between active sublist and archive sublist and sends awareness manager a notification regarding any change in a notification state step .

Reference is now made to which is a simplified conceptual illustration of an awareness notification management system constructed and operative in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention and additionally to which is a simplified flowchart illustration of an exemplary method of operation of the system of operative in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Once awareness manager has determined the states of the members of contact list and is enabled to monitor the statuses of and forward awareness notifications from the members of active sublist using any of the methods described above the system of is preferably used to detect new collaborations between client and members of contact list in order to update history active sublist and archive sublist accordingly. For example awareness manager may detect information such as email exchanged via server between client and client who is currently disabled step . Awareness manager records the timestamp of the email and updates history with the new timestamp step . If the system is configured to require awareness manager to execute any status changes and contact list updates then awareness manager activates client in contact list of client using the methods described above step . If the system is configured to enable client to change the notification state of contacts and update contact list then awareness manager notifies client that client may be activated step . Client activates client using the methods described above and sends awareness manager a notification that client has been activated step . Upon receiving the notification that client has been activated awareness manager forwards to client awareness notifications sent from client step .

Reference is now made to which is a simplified conceptual illustration of an awareness notification management system constructed and operative in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The system of is substantially similar to the systems described above with the noted exception that clients and may include more than one device such as a computer cellular phone or laptop. For example using the systems and methods described above all the devices included in client may communicate with and receive awareness notifications from awareness manager and all devices included in client may communicate with and send awareness notifications to awareness manager .

It will be appreciated that by managing and organizing contact lists into more than one sublist associated with a defined state and filtering awareness notifications accordingly presence awareness may be supported with reduced network load while not affecting the utility of collaboration software.
