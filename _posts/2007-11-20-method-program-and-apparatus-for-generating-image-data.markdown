The present invention relates to a technology for generating data of an image to be displayed on a client in a server. More particularly the present invention relates to a method computer program and apparatus for generating data of an image to be displayed on a client on a server side which can reduce the amount of data to be transferred to the client such as a mobile cell phone or personal digital assistant having a restricted image display function and which can implement an efficient user interface at the client.

Currently a network based computer system environment is widely used wherein clients client devices client computers and the like are connected to a server system composed of a server computer and its peripheral devices hereinafter simply referred to as a server via a network such as the Internet or the intranet including in house LAN . In particular with the prevalence of the mobile cell phones and personal digital assistants PDAs it has become increasingly common to use such instruments as the clients to enable remote control of the server.

Communication between the gateway and the client such as a mobile cell phone is generally made according to the HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol which means that in order to remotely control the server from the client it is necessary to know the status of the server by allowing the content of the image displayed on a display of the server as a control target to be displayed on the client side as well. In other words in order to perform a series of control operations for the remote control the succeeding control operations need to be performed in accordance with the content of the image displayed on the display of the server that was acquired by the client.

The image displayed on the display of the server however cannot be observed by the user on the client side in real time what can be observed is only the stationary image obtained from the server at that time point. It is often difficult from only the information of the acquired image to determine how the image has changed from its previous state.

Further the mobile cell phone or the personal digital assistant has the display screen of a limited size that is the total number of pixels for display is much smaller than that of the display of the server which means that if it is tried to display the entire image displayed on the display of the server as a control target on the display screen of a limited size of the mobile cell phone or the like the image initially expressed using a great number of pixels in the server should be expressed using less pixels which inevitably results in coarse resolution of the image displayed on the mobile cell phone or the like. For the user observing the image of such coarse resolution displayed on the display screen of the client it would be very difficult to make accurate judgment of the situation for the succeeding control operation of the server for example which portion should be clicked on next .

On the contrary if it is tried to display an image on the display screen of such a limited size of the client in the same pixel resolution as the one displayed on the display of the server as the control target only a part of the whole image displayed on the display of the server would be displayed on the display screen of the mobile cell phone or the like which results in poor prospect of the entire image and thus is disadvantageous in terms of user s operability as well as operating efficiency. Furthermore in this case particularly when the mobile cell phone or the like has a full browser function screen scrolling will readily be performed on the display screen of the client if not only the part of the image data but also the image data covering a wide range including its peripheral region is fetched from the server and temporarily stored in an image buffer or the like of the client. In such a case if the image data for the whole display screen of the server is transferred as the image of the wide range the amount of data transferred from the server to the client would be huge which is disadvantageous in terms of communication cost across the network and response speed to the control operation performance .

There exists a conventional technology for efficiently performing remote control of the server from the client such as a mobile cell phone having a display screen of a small size as described above. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Kokai No. 2002 111893 discloses an invention of a method for remotely controlling an external computer i.e. server in the GUI Graphical User Interface environment by a mobile cell phone or other personal digital assistant i.e. client . Specifically in response to a control operation from the personal digital assistant each GUI part displayed on a screen of the external computer is detected and based on its analysis result the GUI part is converted into a text or the like so that it can readily be displayed on the personal digital assistant and the converted data is transmitted to the personal digital assistant to enable remote control of the computer in the GUI environment from the personal digital assistant having a limited display function or the like with a considerably reduced communication cost therebetween.

This method however aims only at implementing remote control of the server in the GUI environment by the client and the GUI image displayed on the server side is not displayed on the client side exactly in the same form. Further while it is described that the state of the display screen of the server or its change is detected it only means that a screen analysis portion and a screen change detection portion obtain information about the name and position of the icon being displayed thereon from the operating system via the API Application Programming Interface or the like. As such it is not possible to detect a change on screen for an inactive window or it is not possible even for an active application window to detect in detail how the display therein has changed.

In view of the foregoing a major object of the present invention is to implement a user interface for remote control which can solve the above described problems currently existing when remotely controlling a server from a client such as a mobile cell phone or the like having only a limited display function and which allows a user to readily recognize a change in state of the image displayed on a display of the server to efficiently determine a control operation to be carried out next while maintaining a GUI based image on the client side similar to the one on the server side and minimizing the amount of data to be transferred from the server.

According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method in a server having a client connected thereto via a network for controlling an image to be displayed on the client which includes the steps of 1 in response to receiving from the client an operation command requesting an operation by the server setting a dividing manner for dividing a display screen of the server into a plurality of sub areas the dividing manner being set by selecting a value corresponding to said client out of candidate values of dividing manner preliminarily stored in the server 2 for each of the plurality of sub areas into which the display screen is divided based on the dividing manner set in the setting step calculating a degree of change of an image displayed on the sub area before and after completion of the operation by the server in response to the operation command 3 generating data of an image for status display the image for status display including an image representing relative positional relationship between the plurality of sub areas and for each of the plurality of sub areas an image representing the degree of change calculated for the sub area and 4 transmitting the data of the image for status display to the client so as to be displayed on a display portion of the client.

There are also provided a computer program causing the server to execute the method and an apparatus in the server capable of implementing the method.

According to a second embodiment of present invention there is provided a method in a server having a client connected thereto via a network for controlling an image to be displayed on the client which includes the steps of 1 analyzing a content of the operation command in response to receiving an operation command from the client 2 if the analyzed command does not cause a change in display content of the display screen setting a dividing manner by selecting a value corresponding to said client out of candidate values of dividing manner preliminarily stored in the server and if the analyzed command causes a change in display content of the display screen setting a new dividing manner that is determined in accordance with the changed display content 3 for each of the plurality of sub areas into which the display screen is divided based on the dividing manner set in the setting step calculating a degree of change of an image displayed on the sub area before and after completion of the operation by the server in response to the operation command 4 generating data of an image for status display the image for status display including an image representing relative positional relationship between the plurality of sub areas and for each of the plurality of sub areas an image representing the degree of change calculated for the sub area and 5 transmitting the data of the image for status display to the client so as to be displayed on a display portion of the client. There are also provided a computer program causing the server to execute the method and an apparatus in the server capable of implementing the method.

According to the present invention in the case of remotely controlling a server from a mobile cell phone or other client having only a limited display function it is possible to implement a user interface for the remote control that allows the user to readily recognize a change in state of the image displayed on a display of the server to efficiently determine a control operation that is to be conducted next while maintaining a GUI based image on the client side similar to that on the server side and while minimizing the amount of data to be transferred from the server.

Hereinafter best modes for carrying out the present invention hereinafter referred to as the embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Through the description of the embodiments the same elements are denoted by the same reference characters.

With this structure a processor also referred to as central processing unit CPU main processor or the like responsible for overall control of the server has a memory controller bridge also referred to as memory bridge first bridge north bridge or the like connected in close proximity thereto.

The graphics controller generates and controls image data to be displayed on a display also referred to as display device or displaying device . A frame buffer memory also referred to as frame buffer bit map memory image memory graphics memory or the like is a memory capable of buffering storing image data for at least one frame of the image to be displayed on the display device and the image data for displaying at least one frame is drawn into the frame buffer memory under the control of the graphics controller . A display interface reads the image data drawn in the frame buffer memory converts the data into a signal format conforming to an interface with the display device and transfers the converted data to be displayed on the display device . While the frame buffer in the example shown in is directly connected to the graphics controller and independent from the main memory it may also be possible to allocate part of the main memory as a frame buffer memory as represented by the UMA Unified Memory Architecture .

The memory controller bridge is also connected via a bus such as a PCI local bus to an I O controller bridge also referred to as I O bridge second bridge south bridge or the like and the I O controller bridge is connected with mass storage devices such as a hard disk drive also referred to as HDD hard disk hard disk storage fixed storage or the like a DVD a CD ROM and an MO via a storage controller including IDE controller SCSI controller and others .

Each computer program is executed as it is loaded to the main memory . The computer program may be compressed or divided into a plurality of pieces to be recorded on a plurality of media.

The I O controller bridge also has a keyboard mouse controller connected thereto and receives an input from input devices such as a keyboard and a mouse . The I O controller bridge further has various external bus interfaces connected thereto. The external bus interface has another server communicably connected thereto and all or part of the above described computer programs may be stored in a hard disk drive constituting the server . Further the server may be connected via the external bus interface to the intranet shown in which enables communication between the server and the client such as a mobile cell phone via the gateway shown in .

For the operating system stored in the mass storage device of the server and responsible for its overall operation an operating system supporting the GUI Graphical User Interface is adapted which may be the Windows R operating system available from Microsoft Corporation the MacOS R available from Apple Computer Incorporated or the UNIX R based system provided with the X Window System. The UNIX R based systems include for example AIX R available from International Business Machines Corporation Linux R and others.

It will readily be understood from the above description that the server suitable for implementing the present invention may be realized by a regular information processing apparatus such as a personal computer workstation mainframe or the like or a combination thereof. The components of the server shown in are only illustrative and all of them are not necessarily indispensable for the present invention. Further it is of course readily conceivable for a person skilled in the art that various modifications are possible for implementing the present invention for example a plurality of servers may be combined and the components described above may be functionally distributed to those servers for implementation. Such modifications are naturally within the spirit of the present invention.

Embodiments of the present invention in the above described system environment will now be described. B A B and A C illustrate processing performed in the server and states of the display screen of a client such as a mobile cell phone corresponding thereto according to a first embodiment of the present invention. shows a flow of processing procedure according to the first embodiment of the present invention.

Hereinafter an operation of the server according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the processing procedure shown in . The server waits for an operation command requesting a certain operation of the server to be transmitted from the client step S . The certain operation may be for example to display an active window of the application on the desk top. When the user of the client designates a control operation with respect to the server by clicking on one of the icons displayed on the operation screen portion for example an operation command corresponding to the relevant control operation is transmitted to the server . Upon reception of the operation command the server firstly identifies the source of the command i.e. which client issued the command by reading associated information of the command or the like step S .

Further the server reads and selects a potential dividing manner corresponding to the client which is stored in advance in the form of e.g. table in the main memory or the like and sets it as the dividing manner to be used when conducting processing such as generating an image for the client which is to be done from now on in response to the operation command from the client step S .

As used herein the dividing manner manner of division refers to how the entire display screen of the server is logically divided into a plurality of sub areas in the case where the image data of the divided sub areas are processed in units of the sub areas and image data for display on the client are generated and transferred to the client according to an embodiment of the present invention. The dividing manner typically includes information about the division number indicating how many sub areas the entire display screen is to be divided into and information about the position size and shape of each of the divided sub areas in relation to the whole display screen although it may include other information as well.

Generally a plurality of clients may be connected to the server in a communicable manner and it is conceivable that each of the connected clients may transmit an operation command to the server . In this case it would be preferable that a different dividing manner can be set for each client so as to be used when the server performs processing for the client that issued the operation command. To this end a dividing manner table is stored in the main memory or other storage of the server and in this table potential dividing manners i.e. dividing manners desired for the clients are stored in association with the respective clients connectable to the server .

For the potential dividing manner for each client a certain value is initially recorded as a default value which may be re recorded in response to a request to change rewrite the value from the client at any time point subsequently. That is the re recording may take place any time irrespective of the procedure in .

In the case where such a value is recorded on the dividing manner table the server reads selects the record of uniform division into 2 by 2 as the potential dividing manner for the client from the entry for the client in the table and sets the same as the dividing manner for the client so as to be used upon processing that is to be done for the client subsequently in response to the operation command from the client .

Consider now that the operation command from the client is to activate an application and display an active window of the application on the desk top. shows the state of the display screen of the display of the server after this operation to display the window of the application has been carried out. The active window for the application is displayed on the desk top slightly lower left of its center. The broken lines and in are dividing lines conceptually indicating that uniform division into 2 by 2 has been set as the dividing manner during the processing for the client which does not mean that the broken lines are actually displayed on the display .

Next for each of the sub areas divided based on the dividing manner set in step S the server calculates a degree of change indicating how much after the server performed the operation in response to the operation command the state of the display screen of the display of the server see has changed from the state of the display screen before the relevant operation see step S . The degree of change may be for example the ratio of the number of pixels having their values changed by the operation with respect to the total number of pixels constituting each sub area. In the present example as a result of the operation performed by the server in response to the operation command from the client the active window is displayed on the desk top and the area A in has 40 of its area at the lower right replaced by the window so that the numerical value of 40 is derived. Similarly for the areas B through D the numerical values of 30 60 and 45 respectively are derived.

It is noted that there conventionally exist various methods for calculating the above described degree of change in the server . For example when the content of the frame buffer memory in is rewritten as the result of the operation in response to the operation command from the client is displayed on the display the number of the rewritten pixels may be totaled for each sub area and its ratio with respect to the total number of pixels in the area may be calculated as the degree of change. As to the other calculating methods they are already known in the art and thus detailed description thereof will not be provided here.

Subsequently in order for an image for status display to be displayed on the status display portion of the display screen of the client the server generates data of the image for status display. The image for status display includes a graphic enabling visual recognition of the relative positional relationship of the sub areas and a visual indication enabling visual recognition of the value representing the degree of change in each sub area that was calculated in step S step S . shows the state of the image for status display generated in step S. The dividing manner set in step S is uniform division into 2 by 2 so that a graphic having four rectangular graphics A through D arranged in adjacent two rows and two columns is generated. Further character string indicators through showing the numerical values calculated in step S for the respective sub areas in percentage are generated and superimposed on the corresponding rectangular graphics. Furthermore only the rectangular graphic C corresponding to the area C that is the sub area having the greatest numerical value calculated is made to have its outer frame and or tone of the background changed from those of the other three rectangular graphics for all of the above see .

The visual indication enabling visual recognition of the numerical value representing the degree of change may take various forms other than the character string indicator in percentage described above. For example the tones of the background may be changed in accordance with the calculated numerical values in the corresponding rectangular graphics see . The tone may be changed for example to make the gray closer to black as the calculated numerical value approaches 100 and closer to white as the value approaches 0 . It may also be possible to change the tone in each rectangular graphic such that the portion in the rectangular graphic corresponding to the portion in the sub area of the display screen of the display where the pixel values have changed i.e. the pixels having their values changed is changed in tone from the remaining portion where the pixel values have not changed to allow the user to recognize the degree of change in the graphical sense rather than from the numerical value see . For example the portion corresponding to the pixels that have changed may be colored black while the remaining portion may be colored white.

After generating the image for status display in step S the server transfers to the client two kinds of image data to be displayed on the display screen of the client step S . shows the state of the display screen of the client after receiving the two kinds of image data from the server .

One of the two kinds of image data transferred from the server to the client is data of an image for operation screen that is to be displayed on the operation screen portion at the upper part of the display screen of the client . This is the image data corresponding to the image displayed on one sub area selected from among the four sub areas obtained by dividing the entire display screen of the server . As a criterion for selecting one sub area the one having the greatest numerical value representing the degree of change in the sub area may be selected. In based on this selection criterion the area C for which the degree of change obtained is the largest value of 60 is selected and the image data corresponding to the image displayed on the area C is transferred to the client for display on the operation screen portion . It is noted that other selection criteria may also be adapted for example a specific sub area e.g. area A on the upper left may always be selected.

The other of the two kinds of image data transferred from the server to the client is the data of the image for status display generated in step S to be displayed on the status display portion at the lower part of the display screen of the client . That is the image displayed in the status display portion includes the graphic having four rectangular graphics A through D corresponding to the four sub areas arranged in adjacent two rows and two columns similarly in the image shown in with the character string indicators through representing the numerical values calculated in step S for the respective sub areas in percentage being superimposed on the corresponding rectangular graphics. Further in order to indicate the sub area having the greatest numerical value calculated in step S only the rectangular graphic C corresponding to the area C has its outer frame and or its tone of the background differentiated from those of the other three rectangles.

The first embodiment of the present invention described above has the following advantages. The user of the client can readily decide that the area C would likely be the most important for the succeeding control operation based on the state displayed on the status display portion . Moreover the state of the area C in the display screen of the display of the server is actually displayed on the operation screen portion which allows the user to confirm the state of the most desired area C or conduct a further control operation thereon.

Generally in the client having only a small display screen as in the mobile cell phone or portable digital assistant the numbers of pixels in vertical and horizontal directions for display on the operation screen portion are often much smaller than those of the image displayed on the display of the server that is desired to be displayed on the screen of the client . In such a case the image data of the original image on the display needs to be scaled reduced in size to match the numbers of pixels in the vertical and horizontal directions of the operation screen portion of the client before being transferred to the client . The image obtained by scaling the sub area will be smaller in reduction ratio than the image obtained by scaling the entire display screen of the display and will result in a finer image when displayed on the operation screen portion . As such the user interface for control operation will considerably improve in the case where the state of the area C is displayed on the operation screen portion as in the first embodiment of the present invention compared to the case where the state of the whole screen of the display is otherwise displayed on the operation screen portion .

Alternatively in the case where the display screen of the client has the function like full browser the image data of the original image in the sub area in the server may be transferred to the client as it is without scaling and saved in an image buffer not shown or the like of the client so that a part of it matching the number of pixels of the operation screen portion may be displayed on the operation screen portion . The range to be displayed can be selected from within the range of the image data saved in the image buffer or the like which ensures high speed scrolling within the range. In this case the volume of the image data to be transferred can considerably be reduced when transferring the image data for the sub area than in the case of transferring the image data for the entire display screen of the server . In other words when the image data of the area C is transferred to the client and a part of it is displayed on the operation screen portion of the display screen provided with the full browser function as in the first embodiment of the present invention the amount of the image data transferred to the client is reduced to one fourth compared to the case of otherwise transferring the image data of the entire display screen of the server and displaying a part of it on the operation screen portion which is very efficient from the standpoint of communication cost as well as operation performance.

Hereinafter a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. B and illustrate processing carried out in the server and the state of the display screen of a mobile cell phone or other client corresponding thereto according to the second embodiment of the present invention. shows a flow of the entire processing according to the second embodiment of the present invention.

It is assumed that the initial state at a certain time point is the same as in the first embodiment of the present invention. That is as shown in on the display screen of the display of the server at a certain time point only a plurality of icons area displayed on the desk top with no active or inactive window displayed thereon. The broken lines and in conceptually indicate the dividing manner set for the client at the current point which lines are not actually displayed on the display . On the client side as shown in four framed rectangular graphics A through D are displayed on the status display portion located at the lower section to indicate that the processing is being carried out by dividing the entire display screen of the display of the server into four sub areas and the image corresponding to the area A is displayed on the operation screen portion at the upper section.

An operation of the server according to the second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the processing procedure shown in . The server waits for an operation command to be transmitted from the client step S . In receipt of the user s operation command from the client the server identifies the source of the command i.e. which client issued the command by reading the associated information of the command or the like step S .

Next the server analyzes the content of the command and determines whether the command causes a change in the display content on the display screen of the server step S . If it is determined that it changes the display content the server sets a new dividing manner which is determined in accordance with the changed display content irrespective of the information of the potential dividing manner for the relevant client prestored in the dividing manner table step S . It is possible to insert following the step S the step of re recording the thus set dividing manner onto the dividing manner table as the potential dividing manner for the relevant client step S .

If it is determined in step S that it does not change the content of the display screen the server reads and selects the potential dividing manner for the relevant client stored in advance in the dividing manner table and sets the same as the dividing manner to be used for the embodiment step S . That is if the operation command is not the one instructing display of a new active window on the desk top the server sets uniform division into 2 by 2 into four rectangular sub areas as the dividing manner to be used for the embodiment based on the potential dividing manner recorded on the entry corresponding to the client in the dividing manner table .

Next for each of the sub areas divided according to the dividing manner set in step S or S the server calculates the degree of change indicating how much after the operation was conducted by the server in response to the operation command the state of the display screen of the display of the server see has changed from the state of the display screen before the relevant operation see specifically it calculates the ratio of the number of pixels having their values changed due to the operation with respect to the total number of pixels constituting each sub area step S . Currently as a result of the operation by the server in response to the operation command from the client an active window is displayed on the desk top and the dividing manner set in step S is division into nine rectangular sub areas in total including the area X covering the active window and the areas E through M arranged to surround the area X . Thus in the area X the active window newly displayed occupies all or almost all the area so that the ratio of the number of pixels having their values changed by the operation with respect to the total number of pixels constituting the sub area calculated as the degree of change becomes almost 100 . In comparison as for the other eight sub areas area E through area M the ratio calculated as the degree of change becomes almost 0 since they do not include any part of the active window .

Subsequently the server generates data of the image for status display so as to be displayed on the status display portion in the display screen of the client which image includes the graphic enabling visual recognition of the relative positional relationship of the sub areas and the visual indication enabling visual recognition of the numerical values representing the degrees of change of the respective sub areas calculated in step S step S . shows the state of the image for status display generated in step S. The dividing manner set in step S is division into a total of nine rectangular sub areas including the rectangular sub area covering the active window and the eight rectangular sub areas arranged to surround it and thus the graphic having nine rectangular graphics X and E through M arranged in adjacent three rows and three columns is generated to allow the user to recognize the dividing manner. Further the character string indicators through representing the numerical values calculated in step S for the respective sub areas in percentage are generated and superimposed on the corresponding rectangular graphics. Furthermore only the rectangular graphic X corresponding to the area X which is the sub area having the greatest numerical value calculated therefor is differentiated in outer frame and or tone of the background from the other eight rectangular graphics.

It is needless to say that the visual indication enabling visual recognition of the numerical value indicating the degree of change may take various forms besides the above described character string indicator similarly in the case of the first embodiment.

After generating the image for status display in step S the server transfers to the client the image data for display on the display screen of the client as in the first embodiment which data includes the data of the image for operation screen to be displayed on the operation screen portion at the upper section and the data of the image for status display generated in step S to be displayed on the status display portion at the lower section step S .

Displayed on the status display portion is similarly the one shown in the image of the graphic having nine rectangular graphics corresponding respectively to the nine sub areas arranged in adjacent three rows and three columns with the character string indicators representing in percentage the numerical values calculated in step S for the respective sub areas being superimposed on the corresponding rectangular graphics. Further in order to indicate the sub area having the greatest numerical value calculated in step S only the rectangular graphic corresponding to the area X has its outer frame and or tone of the background differentiated from those of the other eight rectangles.

The second embodiment of the present invention compared to the first embodiment has further advantages as follows. While the state of the area C is displayed on the operation screen portion in the first embodiment as shown in the area C does not cover the entire active window which means that an item that the user wishes to operate next may not be included in the area C. In this case the user needs to transmit to the server a request to switch the source of the image displayed on the operation screen portion to successively check the contents displayed on the other sub areas. In contrast according to the second embodiment of the present invention the state of the area X which is the sub area including the entire active window displayed on the display is displayed on the operation screen portion . Accordingly there is substantially no need for the user to switch the source of the image displayed on the operation screen portion for a next control operation considering that the object of the next control operation must be included in that area X .

While the processing procedures according to the first and second embodiments of the present invention have been explained above these processing procedures may be accomplished when a computer program such as the application software or the operating system stored in the hard disk drive or the like of the server uses the processor and other components of the server to cause the components to execute the same. In other words the present invention may be understood as a computer program that causes the server to execute the processing procedures.

Further these processing procedures may be accomplished by causing the graphics controller or other hardware component included in the server to execute the same. In other words the present invention may be understood as an apparatus provided with a block executing the processing procedures.

While some embodiments of the present invention have been described above many other embodiments are possible for the present invention and the above embodiments do not restrict the claimed invention. That is it is apparent for a person skilled in the art that various modifications or improvements are possible for the embodiments above. It is also apparent from the recitation in the claims that such modified or improved embodiments may be included in the technical scope of the present invention.
