This application is related to co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 726 953 filed Mar. 23 2007 and entitled Advertising Rewards and Referrals which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.

The present invention relates generally to computer programs and software applications and online advertising. More specifically user controlled file interaction is described.

The Internet and World Wide Web allow the access retrieval and viewing of various types of content. In general content can include data and information intended for various purposes including editorial special interests commercial advertising business recreational political military special interests and others. Conventionally content for a web page is often inter mixed with different types of content such as advertisements e.g. tile banner static video and audio based and other types which are often used to generate revenue for advertising product or service companies. Advertising and marketing agencies and other entities often invest substantial resources to develop create place and promote goods and services of clients often using online advertising and marketing vehicles and techniques such as banner tile cube interstitial video audio multi media or rich media and other types. However online advertisements typically have very low returns on investment. In other words conventional online advertising techniques typically have large distribution but very low response rates to discounts deals sales or other advertised sales. Further gathering and analyzing advertisement and campaign performance information regarding what users like and dislike is often difficult data mining intensive expensive and time consuming. Still further advertisements and other displayed information are typically targeted using conventional techniques that are not effective accurate or inexpensive.

Some conventional online advertising techniques provide static information that may be viewed but not interacted with by a user. Other conventional advertisements allow for user interaction by clicking on or clicking through the ad to an off page link or other destination where data and information related to the advertisement are presented. Still other conventional advertisements allow users to click on a region of a link enter information or provide personal information to obtain an incentive or other reward. However users are unable to control the delivery and presentation of these advertisements. Further conventional advertisements do not allow users to determine or control which advertisements are presented. Conventional advertisements that allow for user interaction also do not provide accurate data or information on campaign effectiveness and often fail to provide any information that suggests what users find desirable or undesirable about a given advertisement.

Thus a solution for gathering user feedback to improve user targeting without the limitations of conventional techniques is needed.

Various embodiments or examples may be implemented in numerous ways including as a system a process an apparatus or a series of program instructions on a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network where the program instructions are sent over optical electronic or wireless communication links. In general operations of disclosed processes may be performed in an arbitrary order unless otherwise provided in the claims.

A detailed description of one or more examples is provided below along with accompanying figures. The detailed description is provided in connection with such examples but is not limited to any particular example. The scope is limited only by the claims and numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents are encompassed. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding. These details are provided as examples and the described techniques may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of the accompanying details. For clarity technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the embodiments has not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description.

In some examples the described techniques may be implemented as a computer program or application application or as a module or sub component of another application. The described techniques may be implemented as software hardware firmware circuitry or a combination thereof. If implemented as software the described techniques may be implemented using various types of programming development scripting or formatting languages frameworks syntax applications protocols objects or techniques including C Objective C C C Flex Java Javascript Ajax COBOL Fortran ADA XML HTML DHTML XHTML HTTP XMPP and others. Design publishing and other types of applications such as Dreamweaver Shockwave Flash and Fireworks may also be used to implement the described techniques. The described techniques may be varied and are not limited to the examples or descriptions provided.

User controlled file interaction is described including presenting advertisements that are configured for user interaction. In some examples an interaction may be an input such as a mouse click mouse over i.e. moving an icon using an input output device such as a computer mouse clicking and dragging text entry or the like. An input may be used to provide input as to whether to present a given advertisement substantially similar or similar advertisements different types of advertisements or other types of files. A file in some examples may be logical groups of data or information that may be used to instantiate an object process or set of objects or processes when invoked. Files may be content such as editorial articles originally authored articles documents images photos video audio multimedia elements advertisements and the like. In other words other types of data or information besides advertisements may be implemented using the described techniques. Here an input may be used to control the presentation of advertisements or other types of files. For example if a given advertisement or file is vetoed a different type of advertisement may be presented. In other examples if an advertisement or file is rated using a qualitative or quantitative rating system the input i.e. ratings may be used to determine whether effectiveness of the rated advertisement or file whether similar advertisements or files should be selected and presented or whether a category or class of advertisement should be selected presented or prevented from presentation. In some examples similar advertisements may be advertisements that share common feature design element i.e. a design or functional component of an advertisement that is presented with an advertisement attribute category classification or other characteristic. In other examples the described techniques may be implemented differently and are not limited to the descriptions provided.

In some examples once content is presented on client ratings application may be invoked to provide ratings and other input e.g. a numerical rating value a qualitative input e.g. yes no dislike like and others a veto and others in response to a file i.e. an advertisement or other content . For example when content is presented on display a user may interact with an advertisement presented with the content by selecting a region element or other attribute or characteristic of an advertisement by using an input output device such as a mouse scroll wheel pointer keyboard and others. Ratings application may be configured to enable client to provide an input via an interaction that is stored on repository . In some examples stored inputs on repository may be evaluated using reporting system to provide information reports analysis and the like to advertisers on the effectiveness statistical performance level of response and other attributes of an advertisement or other file served by ad server from repository . In other examples system may be configured and implemented differently than shown and described.

Here data transferred over API may be used by application to identify user preferences associated with advertisements. API may be used to transfer data between application and the described modules and other sources or destinations e.g. an operating system another application port or other source destination . In some examples user preferences may be determined based on input provided in an interaction with an advertisement or file. For example a user on client may interact with an advertisement by providing a rating. In some examples a rating may be provided using an application or other facility in which the advertisement or file is presented. In other examples a rating may be provided directly or indirectly in the advertisement or file. In still other examples a veto or other subjective qualitative input may be provided in lieu of a numerical quantitative input. As yet another example users may veto an advertisement or group category type or stack i.e. a group of advertisements. If a group of advertisements are queued for presentation on display e.g. a veto may be used to remove or prevent some advertisements in the group from being presented. For example a user may veto advertisements in an automotive category. A veto would then initiate sending data to control and prevent the further presentation of automotive advertisements from inventor associated with a given website. If a user vetoes an advertisement or a category of advertisements the remaining advertisements in the group may be presented. However a threshold value may be set to prevent exceeding a maximum number of advertisements from being vetoed. In other words advertisements in a group may be vetoed to prevent further presentation but if the vetoed advertisements exceed a certain number or threshold e.g. 20 then the complete group of advertisements may be made available for presentation again. In other examples different types of inputs other than vetoes and ratings may be provided and are not limited to the examples described.

In some examples repository may be a local database data mart data warehouse or other storage facility for storing data that may be accessed by application . For example data associated with ratings provided by users in response to advertisements may be stored in repository . As another example data used to generate reports by reporting system may be stored and accessed in repository . In still other examples repository may be a remote repository as described below in connection with . Here reporting system may be included as part of application and used to generate reports and other analysis that may be useful to advertisers marketers agencies or other entities or individuals interested in evaluating the effectiveness of a given campaign or advertisement. In other examples application and the above described elements may be implemented as an application installed at a single location or at multiple distributed locations. In some examples application may be implemented using web services formats e.g. IEEE WSDL and others to provide a distributed application architecture for providing user control of advertisements.

As an example application may be implemented to provide users control over the presentation of advertisements displayed. For example an automotive advertisement may be presented in a car repair article. When the advertisement is presented a user may move an icon over the advertisement or an element e.g. a region portion section or other sub area of an advertisement to enable the presentation of a menu for example that allows the user to provide a numerical rating for the advertisement. In other examples a rating menu or choice of rating values may be presented as part of an advertisement. In still other examples rating values may be presented within the visual display or appearance of an advertisement. For example a portion of an advertisement may include rating values and when a user selects a rating value data is transmitted from client to ad server server or another destination that stores the rating value. In other examples when an input output icon e.g. pointer icon and the like is moved over an advertisement presented on display a callout window or bubble may appear that presents rating values or options to the user providing an opportunity to provide feedback regarding the presented advertisement. For example when a boat advertisement is presented the user may be a sailor and wish to see other similar advertisements. When a rating value is input e.g. 5 out of a 5 point scale selecting a radio button adjacent to a grade of A and others data is then sent from client to ad server and server requesting other ads that are similar i.e. other advertisements for boat auctions boat sales boat equipment sailing training and the like .

By using ratings or rating values performance of an advertisement may be measured. If the rating indicates i.e. is above a pre established threshold value that the user likes the advertisement and wants to see other similar i.e. having one or more attributes in common advertisements then application may store this data in repository and generate a report using reporting system that indicates the effectiveness or quality of a given advertisement or advertising campaign. Reports may be used to generate quantitative e.g. statistical or qualitative e.g. subjective input comments feedback and the like information for advertisers marketers authors and others with summary information of a given advertisement or advertising campaign. In other examples application may be implemented differently and may also vary in architecture function design operation or other attributes.

In some examples advertisement may be configured with a portion of its layout e.g. at one end of advertisement made available for presenting user control panel . Here advertisement includes user control panel which may be configured to allow users to input a rating e.g. More like this Sometimes Never again and others associated with the ad. When a user inputs a rating e.g. selecting a radio button next to the selection More like this data i.e. control data may be transmitted to ad server and server to indicate a user preference for receiving other advertisements that are similar to advertisement . For example if a user finds a recruiting advertisement for the U.S. Navy interesting he may also want to view other advertisements for different branches of the Armed Forces. When the input is provided using an input output device icon mechanism pointer or the like a request is sent for other advertisements or files to be sent based upon the user s preference or request. In other examples display and the above described elements may be varied in design implementation layout and function and are not limited to the descriptions provided.

Once presented user control panel may be used to provide input that specifies a preference as to whether to veto advertisement . In other examples user control panel may be configured differently to allow input of numerical quantitative or subject data and information. For example a text input field may be provided to allow users to specify types of advertisements to serve on display . As another example a survey of questions may be presented e.g. to allow users to specify whether they like or dislike given advertisements. In still other examples user control panel may be implemented differently in terms of design layout and function and are not limited to the examples provided.

According to some examples computer system performs specific operations by processor executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions stored in system memory . Such instructions may be read into system memory from another computer readable medium such as static storage device or disk drive . In some examples hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions for implementation.

The term computer readable medium refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media includes for example optical or magnetic disks such as disk drive . Volatile media includes dynamic memory such as system memory . Transmission media includes coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including wires that comprise bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications.

Common forms of computer readable media includes for example floppy disk flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium CD ROM any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes RAM PROM EPROM FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge carrier wave or any other medium from which a computer can read.

In some examples execution of the sequences of instructions may be performed by a single computer system . According to some examples two or more computer systems coupled by communication link e.g. LAN PSTN or wireless network may perform the sequence of instructions in coordination with one another. Computer system may transmit and receive messages data and instructions including program i.e. application code through communication link and communication interface . Received program code may be executed by processor as it is received and or stored in disk drive or other non volatile storage for later execution.

The foregoing examples have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding but are not limited to the details provided. There are many alternative ways and techniques for implementation. The disclosed examples are illustrative and not restrictive.
