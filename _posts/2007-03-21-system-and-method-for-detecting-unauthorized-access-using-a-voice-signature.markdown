Speech recognition unit generates voice signatures from voice inputs. A voice signature describes features of a voice input that are intended to distinguish the voice input from other voice inputs. Accordingly a voice signature may be used to identify a voice input. As an example a voice signature may be represented by a feature vector that has values for variables that describe certain features of a voice input signal. For example a feature vector may comprise a frequency value for a variable that represents the frequency of the signal. Other features may be represented by a frequency vector for example the duration and energy level at a given frequency. Fast Fourier transforms discrete cosine transforms wavelet techniques or other suitable technique may be used to determine the feature vector of a voice input.

Voice validation unit compares voice signatures to determine if they match. Matching voice signatures may indicate that the voice signatures correspond to the same voice imprint belonging to the same user. According to one embodiment voice validation unit compares an input voice signature of a voice input to a stored voice signature to determined if the input voice signature belongs to an authorized user. Voice validation unit may perform voice validation in any suitable manner. For example voice validation unit may compare an input feature vector for a voice input to a stored feature vector that includes values with variability ranges. If the values of the input feature vector fall within the variability ranges of the stored feature vector the input feature vector may be determined to correspond to the same voice input of the stored feature vector. Other suitable procedures for performing voice validation however may be used.
