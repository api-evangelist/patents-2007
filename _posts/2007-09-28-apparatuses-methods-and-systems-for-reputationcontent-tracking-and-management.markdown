The present invention is directed generally to an apparatuses methods and systems for data management and more particularly to APPARATUSES METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR REPUTATION CONTENT TRACKING AND MANAGEMENT.

Watermarking has been used for hundreds of years to verify the authenticity and prevent forgeries of paper goods. Similarly digital watermarking may be used to uniquely identify electronic content. File hosting services allow users to upload files to an Internet website. The stored files may then be made accessible to other users.

User submitted digital content has become an important element of the Internet. Publicly accessible websites such as YouTube MetaCafe Google Video and like user generated content sites UGCS collectively allow users to watch and share video content. Although much of the content is created by users some of the uploaded content is copyrighted e.g. copyrighted content ripped from TV shows . As such UGCSs may be faced with law suits for copyright infringement for unauthorized copyrighted content uploaded by third party users i.e. not the copyright owner . Although UGCSs may sometimes remove such content when they become aware of it the processes of locating the content notification and takedown is burdensome inefficient able to be circumvented and slow.

The disclosure teaches APPARATUSES METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR REPUTATION CONTENT TRACKING AND MANAGEMENT hereinafter REPTRACK which provides a straightforward dynamic and comprehensive way for managing and monitoring posting of content onto a publicly accessible website. In one embodiment the REPTRACK controls posting of content onto a publicly accessible website based upon a determined level of trust associated with a submitter of content. In one implementation the determination may optionally include the checking of fingerprints watermarks and or other information embedded in or associated with said content prior to or during the uploading of the content to the UGCS.

The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and or detailed. As such a detailed discussion of reference number would be found and or introduced in . Reference number is introduced in etc.

For the purpose of illustrating functionality associated with the REPTRACK the following discussion includes the REPTRACK implemented in the context of user submitted video hosting. However it is to be understood there is significant flexibility scalability and adaptability associated with the REPTRACK. As such there are a wide variety of possible implementations of the REPTRACK that may be configured to meet the needs of a variety of users and or implementers.

A UGCS may implement the REPTRACK to provide themselves with an effective level of protection against users posting copyrighted content that is not so restrictive that it scares off legitimate potential posters. In one embodiment the REPTRACK operates to maximize the user experience of potential content posters by establishing a level of trust for at least some subset of users. In one implementation highly trusted posters may encounter few hurdles in terms of number of clicks keystrokes and or waiting time to successful posting of their submitted content. Less trusted posters may encounter higher hurdles. The REPTRACK associated hurdles the user encounters are commensurate with the user s level of trust. In one embodiment trust levels may tiered for example a high trust level with very short or no delay between submission and posting a medium trust level with moderate delay and a low trust level with a longer delay. In another embodiment the trust level of users and the associated hurdles may be distributed across a spectrum. For example in one embodiment less trusted users may encounter longer waiting times but if they are only somewhat less trusted they may still receive solicitous treatment such as gently phrased requests for additional information and or entertaining diversions such as games to play music to listen to and or videos to watch while they are waiting for the clearinghouse or UGCS to determine whether or not to post the content that they have submitted.

The REPTRACK determines the required trust threshold for immediate posting and or other hurdle thresholds . If the user s trust score exceeds the threshold the REPTRACK may post the uploaded content . If the user s trust score is less than the threshold the REPTRACK may verify the content . Verifying the content may include forwarding and or instructing users to forward prospective posted content to an internal clearinghouse and or third party clearinghouse. The clearinghouse may then perform various rights verifications and or checks such as examining said content for fingerprints or watermarks of content owners and providing an indication to the REPTRACK and or potential posting sites of the presence or absence of said fingerprints watermarks. In another embodiment checking for fingerprints watermarks may be left to the intended upload site such as for example any UGCS. If the content is determined to be postable the REPTRACK updates the user s profile with the postable submission information and or upgrade the user s trust score and posts the submitted content . If the content is not postable the REPTRACK updates the user s profile with the unpostable submission information and or downgrades the user s trust score . The REPTRACK may also notify the user that the uploaded content is unpostable . In one embodiment content is deemed to be in a postable state when it is determined that the content has been supplied by authorized persons. In another embodiment postability may alternatively or additionally be determined according to the results of one or more rights verification procedures.

In a further embodiment the REPTRACK may perform an initial analysis on uploaded content to determine if more or fewer measures should be taken to determine the postability of the content. For example if the uploaded content is a very short video clip it may not be necessary and or economical to perform all of the above postability steps. Alternatively if the video file is large i.e. a long clip and or a high resolution clip additional measures may be indicated to assure the upload is postable i.e. does not infringe copyright .

If the number of submission is greater than the lowest threshold but less than the secondary threshold e.g. greater than 50 submissions but less than 200 the REPTRACK may determine the account term of the user . In some embodiments newer users may be given a relatively lower trust level until they have had a relationship with the REPTRACK for a given period of time. For example the figure shows that if the user s account term is less than one month the user may be assigned a low trust level even if they have uploaded more than the lowest threshold. This allows the REPTRACK to avoid being manipulated or gamed for example by new users or experienced user register new accounts who may submit numerous innocuous videos in order to gain a higher level of trust so that they can upload ripped or restricted videos. If the user has an account term of one month or greater the REPTRACK determines the number of unpostable or forbidden submissions . If the user has uploaded one or more unpostable submissions the REPTRACK may assign the user a low trust level . If none of the user s submissions have been deemed to be unpostable the REPTRACK may assign the user a medium trust level .

The figure shows that if the REPTRACK determines a user has 200 or more previous submissions the REPTRACK determines the account term . If the account term is less than one month the REPTRACK determines the number of unpostable submissions and applies the rules described above 350 i.e. assigns a low trust level if there was one or more unpostable submissions and a medium trust level if there were no unpostable submissions . If the user has an account term of a month or more the REPTRACK still checks the number of unpostable submissions but applies a different rule. If there are more than three unpostable submissions the user may be assigned a low trust level . If the user has between one and three unpostable submissions the REPTRACK may assign a medium trust level to the user. If the user has 200 or more uploads and account term of one month or more and no unpostable submissions the REPTRACK may assign the user a high trust level . Although the figure shows specific numerical thresholds the REPTRACK is flexible and may be configured to utilize a variety of thresholds and or rules. For example certain embodiments may utilize percentage thresholds e.g. percentage of submissions that are unpostable . The elements shown in provide an illustrative example for an embodiment of the REPTRACK. Depending on the embodiment and or implementation other elements such as identity verification and behavior analysis may be included and other elements excluded.

In one embodiment the REPTRACK may control posting of copyrighted material by including embedding fingerprinting and or watermarking software and or hardware in potential upload client systems. Such implementation may include having software and or hardware fingerprint watermark content for uploading with or without the knowledge of the user of said client systems. Some implementations of the REPTRACK do not include embedding fingerprinting watermarking software and or hardware in potential upload client systems. For example it may be assumed that content owners and or device makers will take explicit actions to fingerprint watermark content.

As discussed above some embodiments of the REPTRACK may withhold posting of content if fingerprints watermarks that match those of copyrighted works are detected. The REPTRACK may also withhold posting if attempts to remove fingerprints watermarks or sufficiently probable indications of such tampering are detected.

In one embodiment the REPTRACK embargos content until such time as the examination of the content for fingerprints watermarks can be completed i.e. delaying posting of content until analysis of the content is complete. In another embodiment the REPTRACK may indicate provisionally posting a deliberately altered or modified version of the content until such time as the analysis of such content for fingerprints watermarks or attempts to remove the same can be completed. Deliberate alteration of content may include for example such techniques as severely reducing the video resolution leaving out segments of audio video inserting a delay between the audio and video inserting a message indicating the status of the content inserting a ghost image adding a caption obscuring portions of audio or video and or the like.

Embodiments of the REPTRACK may operate flexibly to improve the experience for the user. Upon submission of a potential post the REPTRACK clearinghouse or UGCS may perform only a relatively simple check to see if the content in that potential post is similar to known copyrighted content. For example only a few possible fingerprint items such as the title and or metadata and or one or a few time samples of the submitted data may be checked as a first cut . If this first examination reveals that the submitted content appears to be very dissimilar to known copyrighted content it may be posted without further checking However if this first examination reveals that the submitted content appears only marginally dissimilar e.g. the level of confidence in the results of the examination is not sufficiently high then some additional time samples of the content may be examined and or more sophisticated signal processing may be performed on the original time samples and or additional time samples to try to establish a greater degree of confidence in the results. However if the first cut examination reveals that the submitted content appears similar to known copyrighted content then a second cut examination that involves examining a large amount of the submitted content and or very sophisticated signal processing may be performed.

In some implementations the REPTRACK may additionally or alternatively use trust levels or trust scores of potential posters to determine the level of fingerprint checking For example if submitted content appears dissimilar to known copyrighted content and the submitter is highly trusted that content may simply be posted with no further checking whereas if the level of trust in the submitter is only moderate some additional but still relatively limited number of time samples of that content may be checked before deciding whether or not to post that content.

Depending on the embodiment the REPTRACK operates flexibly by varying the level of checking based upon the content type and or rules provided by content owners. For example more exhaustive checking may be performed for submissions labeled or suspected to be high resolution. The resolution may be inferred for example from the file type and or determined by signal processing performed by the client clearinghouse UGCS and or REPTRACK. The clearinghouse and or UGCS may establish checking levels or levels may be based upon rules specified by content owners and such rules may vary from one content owner to another.

Some embodiments of the REPTRACK may include using a universal client which allows more or less automatic authorization for trusted posters but which client may be revoked automatic authorization disabled by the REPTRACK clearinghouse UGCS and or content owners should that client subsequently become untrusted. For example even though the submission history of a given client may cause the REPTRACK and or other entities to assign a high level of trust to a given client at a given time subsequent unacceptable submissions may cause the REPTRACK clearinghouse UGCS content owner s to assign a lower level of trust to a that client i.e. to revoke automatic or simplified authorization for submissions from that client.

Alternatively in some embodiments the client may send the content and the fingerprint more or less simultaneously and the UGCS or clearinghouse may embargo and or degrade respectively the content until the check for copyrighted content has concluded. Should the clearinghouse or UGCS conclude that the content is likely to be a copy of a copyrighted work the content may not be posted and may instead be saved or discarded . A log of such actions including information identifying the content may be maintained by the clearinghouse or UGCS . In such cases if the content was initially submitted to the clearinghouse the clearinghouse may notify the UGCS and or the submitter that the submission has been rejected for posting. If the content was initially submitted to the UGCS the UGCS may notify the submitter that the submission has been rejected for posting. Notification may optionally include the clearinghouse and or UGCS notifying content owners if content has been rejected for posting. In some situations content owners might respond and indicate that posting should be allowed for example if the content owners believe posting of the content could useful for marketing e.g. viral video .

Alternatively in some embodiments the client may simply send the content i.e. not generate 412 or send the fingerprint to the UGCS or clearinghouse for checking . In some embodiments in which the client does not send a fingerprint the UGCS or the clearinghouse may embargo and or degrade the content until the check for copyrighted content has concluded. The fingerprint database may be implemented at the UGCS and or the clearinghouse using data supplied by a vendor. Alternatively the fingerprint database may be generated by the UGCS and or clearinghouse offline or in real time by scanning content e.g. suspected likely to be infringed.

Typically users which may be people and or other systems engage information technology systems e.g. commonly computers to facilitate information processing. In turn computers employ processors to process information such processors are often referred to as central processing units CPU . A common form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor. CPUs use communicative signals to enable various operations. Such communicative signals may be stored and or transmitted in batches as program and or data components facilitate desired operations. These stored instruction code signals may engage the CPU circuit components to perform desired operations. A common type of program is a computer operating system which commonly is executed by CPU on a computer the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Common resources employed in information technology systems include input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer memory storage into which data may be saved and processors by which information may be processed. Often information technology systems are used to collect data for later retrieval analysis and manipulation commonly which is facilitated through a database program. Information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access and operate various system components.

In one embodiment the REPTRACK controller may be connected to and or communicate with entities such as but not limited to one or more users from user input devices peripheral devices a cryptographic processor device and or a communications network .

Networks are commonly thought to comprise the interconnection and interoperation of clients servers and intermediary nodes in a graph topology. It should be noted that the term server as used throughout this disclosure refers generally to a computer other device program or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting clients. The term client as used herein refers generally to a computer other device program or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer other device program or combination thereof that facilitates processes information and requests and or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a node. Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a router. There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks LANs Pico networks Wide Area Networks WANs Wireless Networks WLANs etc. For example the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.

The REPTRACK controller may be based on common computer systems that may comprise but are not limited to components such as a computer systemization connected to memory .

A computer systemization may comprise a clock central processing unit CPU a read only memory ROM a random access memory RAM and or an interface bus and most frequently although not necessarily are all interconnected and or communicating through a system bus . Optionally the computer systemization may be connected to an internal power source . Optionally a cryptographic processor may be connected to the system bus. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and provides a base signal. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of signals embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative signals may further be transmitted received and the cause of return and or reply signal communications beyond the instant computer systemization to communications networks input devices other computer systemizations peripheral devices and or the like. Of course any of the above components may be connected directly to one another connected to the CPU and or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.

The CPU comprises at least one high speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and or system generated requests. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as AMD s Athlon Duron and or Opteron IBM and or Motorola s PowerPC IBM s and Sony s Cell processor Intel s Celeron Itanium Pentium Xeon and or XScale and or the like processor s . The CPU interacts with memory through signal passing through conductive conduits to execute stored signal program code according to conventional data processing techniques. Such signal passing facilitates communication within the REPTRACK controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed parallel mainframe and or super computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively should deployment requirements dictate greater portability smaller Personal Digital Assistants PDAs may be employed.

The power source may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells alkaline lithium hydride lithium ion lithium polymer nickel cadmium solar cells and or the like. Other types of AC or DC power sources may be used as well. In the case of solar cells in one embodiment the case provides an aperture through which the solar cell may capture photonic energy. The power cell is connected to at least one of the interconnected subsequent components of the REPTRACK thereby providing an electric current to all subsequent components. In one example the power source is connected to the system bus component . In an alternative embodiment an outside power source is provided through a connection across the I O interface. For example a USB and or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.

Interface bus ses may accept connect and or communicate to a number of interface adapters conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards such as but not limited to input output interfaces I O 508 storage interfaces network interfaces and or the like. Optionally cryptographic processor interfaces similarly may be connected to the interface bus. The interface bus provides for the communications of interface adapters with one another as well as with other components of the computer systemization. Interface adapters are adapted for a compatible interface bus. Interface adapters conventionally connect to the interface bus via a slot architecture. Conventional slot architectures may be employed such as but not limited to Accelerated Graphics Port AGP Card Bus Extended Industry Standard Architecture E ISA Micro Channel Architecture MCA NuBus Peripheral Component Interconnect Extended PCI X PCI Express Personal Computer Memory Card International Association PCMCIA and or the like.

Storage interfaces may accept communicate and or connect to a number of storage devices such as but not limited to storage devices removable disc devices and or the like. Storage interfaces may employ connection protocols such as but not limited to Ultra Serial Advanced Technology Attachment Packet Interface Ultra Serial ATA PI Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics E IDE Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 1394 fiber channel Small Computer Systems Interface SCSI Universal Serial Bus USB and or the like.

Network interfaces may accept communicate and or connect to a communications network . Through a communications network the REPTRACK controller is accessible through remote clients e.g. computers with web browsers by users . Network interfaces may employ connection protocols such as but not limited to direct connect Ethernet thick thin twisted pair 10 100 1000 Base T and or the like Token Ring wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11a x and or the like. A communications network may be any one and or the combination of the following a direct interconnection the Internet a Local Area Network LAN a Metropolitan Area Network MAN an Operating Missions as Nodes on the Internet OMNI a secured custom connection a Wide Area Network WAN a wireless network e.g. employing protocols such as but not limited to a Wireless Application Protocol WAP I mode and or the like and or the like. A network interface may be regarded as a specialized form of an input output interface. Further multiple network interfaces may be used to engage with various communications network types . For example multiple network interfaces may be employed to allow for the communication over broadcast multicast and or unicast networks.

Input Output interfaces I O 508 may accept communicate and or connect to user input devices peripheral devices cryptographic processor devices and or the like. I O may employ connection protocols such as but not limited to Apple Desktop Bus ADB Apple Desktop Connector ADC audio analog digital monaural RCA stereo and or the like IEEE 1394a b infrared joystick keyboard midi optical PC AT PS 2 parallel radio serial USB video interface BNC coaxial composite digital Digital Visual Interface DVI RCA RF antennae S Video VGA and or the like wireless and or the like. A common output device is a television set which accepts signals from a video interface. Also a video display which typically comprises a Cathode Ray Tube CRT or Liquid Crystal Display LCD based monitor with an interface e.g. DVI circuitry and cable that accepts signals from a video interface may be used. The video interface composites information generated by a computer systemization and generates video signals based on the composited information in a video memory frame. Typically the video interface provides the composited video information through a video connection interface that accepts a video display interface e.g. an RCA composite video connector accepting an RCA composite video cable a DVI connector accepting a DVI display cable etc. .

User input devices may be card readers dongles finger print readers gloves graphics tablets joysticks keyboards mouse mice remote controls retina readers trackballs trackpads and or the like.

Peripheral devices may be connected and or communicate to I O and or other facilities of the like such as network interfaces storage interfaces and or the like. Peripheral devices may be audio devices cameras dongles e.g. for copy protection ensuring secure transactions with a digital signature and or the like external processors for added functionality goggles microphones monitors network interfaces printers scanners storage devices video devices video sources visors and or the like.

It should be noted that although user input devices and peripheral devices may be employed the REPTRACK controller may be embodied as an embedded dedicated and or monitor less i.e. headless device wherein access would be provided over a network interface connection.

Cryptographic units such as but not limited to microcontrollers processors interfaces and or devices may be attached and or communicate with the REPTRACK controller. A MC68HC16 microcontroller commonly manufactured by Motorola Inc. may be used for and or within cryptographic units. Equivalent microcontrollers and or processors may also be used. The MC68HC16 microcontroller utilizes a 16 bit multiply and accumulate instruction in the 16 MHz configuration and requires less than one second to perform a 512 bit RSA private key operation. Cryptographic units support the authentication of communications from interacting agents as well as allowing for anonymous transactions. Cryptographic units may also be configured as part of CPU. Other commercially available specialized cryptographic processors include VLSI Technology s 33 MHz 6868 or Semaphore Communications 40 MHz Roadrunner 184.

Generally any mechanization and or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However memory is a fungible technology and resource thus any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the REPTRACK controller and or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on chip CPU memory e.g. registers RAM ROM and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism of course such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration memory will include ROM RAM and a storage device . A storage device may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum a fixed and or removable magnetic disk drive a magneto optical drive an optical drive i.e. CD ROM RAM Recordable R ReWritable RW DVD R RW etc. an array of devices e.g. Redundant Array of Independent Disks RAID and or other devices of the like. Thus a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.

The memory may contain a collection of program and or database components and or data such as but not limited to operating system component s operating system information server component s information server user interface component s user interface Web browser component s Web browser database s mail server component s mail client component s cryptographic server component s cryptographic server the REPTRACK component s and or the like i.e. collectively a component collection . These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non conventional program components such as those in the component collection typically are stored in a local storage device they may also be loaded and or stored in memory such as peripheral devices RAM remote storage facilities through a communications network ROM various forms of memory and or the like.

The operating system component is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the REPTRACK controller. Typically the operating system facilitates access of I O network interfaces peripheral devices storage devices and or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant scalable and secure system such as Apple Macintosh OS X Server AT T Plan 9 Be OS Unix and Unix and Unix like system distributions such as AT T s UNIX Berkley Software Distribution BSD variations such as FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD and or the like Linux distributions such as Red Hat Ubuntu and or the like and or the like operating systems. However more limited and or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS IBM OS 2 Microsoft DOS Microsoft Windows 2000 2003 3.1 95 98 CE Millenium NTNista XP Server Palm OS and or the like. An operating system may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or the like. Most frequently the operating system communicates with other program components user interfaces and or the like. For example the operating system may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses. The operating system once executed by the CPU may enable the interaction with communications networks data I O peripheral devices program components memory user input devices and or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the REPTRACK controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the REPTRACK controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction such as but not limited to multicast TCP IP UDP unicast and or the like.

An information server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as but not limited to Apache Software Foundation s Apache Microsoft s Internet Information Server and or the. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page ASP ActiveX ANSI Objective C C and or .NET Common Gateway Interface CGI scripts Java JavaScript Practical Extraction Report Language PERL Hypertext Pre Processor PHP pipes Python WebObjects and or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as but not limited to File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTPS Secure Socket Layer SSL messaging protocols e.g. America Online AOL Instant Messenger AIM Application Exchange APEX ICQ Internet Relay Chat IRC Microsoft Network MSN Messenger Service Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol PRIM Internet Engineering Task Force s IETF s Session Initiation Protocol SIP SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions SIMPLE open XML based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP i.e. Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance s OMA s Instant Messaging and Presence Service IMPS Yahoo Instant Messenger Service and or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System DNS resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the REPTRACK controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example a request such as http 123.124.125.126 myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request 123.124.125.126 resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the myInformation.html portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information myInformation.html. Additionally other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports e.g. FTP communications across port and or the like. An information server may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the information server communicates with the REPTRACK database operating systems other program components user interfaces Web browsers and or the like.

Access to the REPTRACK database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below e.g. CGI and through inter application communication channels as enumerated below e.g. CORBA WebObjects etc. . Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the REPTRACK. In one embodiment the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and or fields. In one embodiment the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join select commands based on the tagged text entries wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the REPTRACK as a query. Upon generating query results from the query the results are passed over the bridge mechanism and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.

Also an information server may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels gearshifts and speedometers facilitate the access operation and display of automobile resources functionality and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes cursors menus scrollers and windows collectively and commonly referred to as widgets similarly facilitate the access operation and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources functionality and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces GUIs such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System s Aqua IBM s OS 2 Microsoft s Windows 2000 2003 3.1 95 98 CE Millenium NTNista i.e. Aero XP or Unix s X Windows e.g. which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment KDE mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment GNOME provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.

A user interface component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by with and or atop operating systems and or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display execution interaction manipulation and or operation of program components and or system facilities through textual and or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect interact and or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the user interface communicates with operating systems other program components and or the like. The user interface may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

A Web browser component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit or greater encryption by way of HTTPS SSL and or the like. Some Web browsers allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Java JavaScript ActiveX web browser plug in APIs e.g. FireFox Safari Plug in and or the like APIs and or the like. Web browsers may implement plug ins or like components to display video e.g. Flash and or the like . Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs cellular telephones and or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the Web browser communicates with information servers operating systems integrated program components e.g. plug ins and or the like e.g. it may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses. Of course in place of a Web browser and information server a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users user agents and or the like from the REPTRACK enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.

A mail server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as but not limited to sendmail Microsoft Exchange and or the. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP ActiveX ANSI Objective C C and or .NET CGI scripts Java JavaScript PERL PHP pipes Python WebObjects and or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as but not limited to Internet message access protocol IMAP Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI Microsoft Exchange post office protocol POP3 simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and or the like. The mail server can route forward and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent relayed and or otherwise traversing through and or to the REPTRACK.

Access to the REPTRACK mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and or the operating system.

Also a mail server may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests information and or responses.

A mail client component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail Microsoft Entourage Microsoft Outlook Microsoft Outlook Express Mozilla Thunderbird and or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols such as IMAP Microsoft Exchange POP3 SMTP and or the like. A mail client may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the mail client communicates with mail servers operating systems other mail clients and or the like e.g. it may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests information and or responses. Generally the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.

A cryptographic server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU cryptographic processor cryptographic processor interface cryptographic processor device and or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and or decryption requests by the cryptographic component however the cryptographic component alternatively may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric e.g. Pretty Good Protection PGP encryption and or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as but not limited to digital certificates e.g. X.509 authentication framework digital signatures dual signatures enveloping password access protection public key management and or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous encryption and or decryption security protocols such as but not limited to checksum Data Encryption Standard DES Elliptical Curve Encryption ECC International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA Message Digest 5 MD5 which is a one way hash function passwords Rivest Cipher RC5 Rijndael RSA which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman Secure Hash Algorithm SHA Secure Socket Layer SSL Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTPS and or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols the REPTRACK may encrypt all incoming and or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network VPN with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of security authorization whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content e.g. employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the REPTRACK component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the REPTRACK and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems i.e. it may act as a client and or server of secured resources. Most frequently the cryptographic component communicates with information servers operating systems other program components and or the like. The cryptographic component may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The REPTRACK database component may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component which is executed by the CPU the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional fault tolerant relational scalable secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field i.e. the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely they uniquely identify rows of a table on the one side of a one to many relationship.

Alternatively the REPTRACK database may be implemented using various standard data structures such as an array hash linked list struct structured text file e.g. XML table and or the like. Such data structures may be stored in memory and or in structured files. In another alternative an object oriented database may be used such as Frontier ObjectStore Poet Zope and or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and or linked together by common attributes they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the REPTRACK database is implemented as a data structure the use of the REPTRACK database may be integrated into another component such as the REPTRACK component . Also the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures objects and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases e.g. tables may be exported and or imported and thus decentralized and or integrated.

In one embodiment the database component includes several tables . A user table includes fields such as but not limited to user profile user uploads user history user account data user content and or the like. The user table may support and or track multiple entity accounts on a REPTRACK. A content table includes fields such as but not limited to content tracking content details content watermarks content embedded info content tracking and or the like. A rules table includes fields such as but not limited to user rules upload rules content rules delay rules embargo rules checking rules tracking rules management rules and or the like.

In one embodiment user programs may contain various user interface primitives which may serve to update the REPTRACK. Also various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the REPTRACK may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers i.e. individual database controllers for each of the above tables . Employing standard data processing techniques one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and or storage devices. Similarly configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and or distributing the various database components . The REPTRACK may be configured to keep track of various settings inputs and parameters via database controllers.

The REPTRACK database may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the REPTRACK database communicates with the REPTRACK component other program components and or the like. The database may contain retain and provide information regarding other nodes and data.

The REPTRACK component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment the REPTRACK component incorporates any and or all combinations of the aspects of the REPTRACK that was discussed in the previous figures. As such the REPTRACK affects accessing obtaining and the provision of information services transactions and or the like across various communications networks.

The REPTRACK component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as but not limited to Apache components Assembly ActiveX binary executables ANSI Objective C C and or .NET database adapters CGI scripts Java JavaScript mapping tools procedural and object oriented development tools PERL PHP Python shell scripts SQL commands web application server extensions WebObjects and or the like. In one embodiment the REPTRACK server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The REPTRACK component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the REPTRACK component communicates with the REPTRACK database operating systems other program components and or the like. The REPTRACK may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses. The REPTRACK may provide format conversion. Supported formats may include MPEG1 MPEG2 MPEG4 DIVX4 5 VOB AVI MS MPEG4 V3 DIVX 3 WAV Real Audio H263 H264 RealVideo 1.0 PGM YUV PPM AC3 PCMB 16 bits VCD XVCD XSVCD mulaw Alaw SUN AU format MPEG audio layer 2 MPEG audio layer 3 MJPEG and or the like. In one example embodiment FFMPEG http ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu is used.

The structure and or operation of any of the REPTRACK node controller components may be combined consolidated and or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and or deployment. Similarly the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and or development. To accomplish this one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.

The component collection may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node and or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load balancing and or data processing techniques. Furthermore single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and or storage devices e.g. databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.

The configuration of the REPTRACK controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as but not limited to the budget capacity location and or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and or integrated program components results in a more distributed series of program components and or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration data may be communicated obtained and or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate obtain and or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to data referencing e.g. pointers internal messaging object instance variable communication shared memory space variable passing and or the like.

If component collection components are discrete separate and or external to one another then communicating obtaining and or providing data with and or to other component components may be accomplished through inter application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to Application Program Interfaces API information passage distributed Component Object Model D COM Distributed Object Linking and Embedding D OLE and or the like Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA local and remote application program interfaces Jini Remote Method Invocation RMI process pipes shared files and or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex yacc XML and or the like which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. Again the configuration will depend upon the context of system deployment.
