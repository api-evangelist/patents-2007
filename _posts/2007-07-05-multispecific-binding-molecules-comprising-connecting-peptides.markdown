Antibodies are dimeric molecules each monomer making up the dimer comprises one light and one heavy chain. Solutions of antibody molecules exist in two forms associated with hinge heterogeneity. Using SDS PAGE analysis of purified Mab MAb typically the two forms are observed as two protein bands a major band MW approximately 150 160 kDa and a minor band MW approximately 75 80 kDa . This latter form is typically observed after SDS PAGE analysis of purified IgG4 preparations but can be identified at much lower frequencies in all IgG isotypes including purified recombinant MAbs Angal et al. 199330 105 Norderhaug et al. 199021 2370 . The larger molecular weight isoform referred to as Form A contains covalent interchain disulfide bonds at positions corresponding to 239 and 242 Kabat numbering system positions 226 and 229 EU numbering system Kabat E Wu T T Perry H M Gottesman K S Foeller C Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. Bethesda US Department of Health and Human Services NIH 1991 . The second isoform Form B is thought to contain no covalent linkages between the two heavy chains and an intrachain disulfide bond between the two neighboring cysteine residues as evidenced by the 75 80 kDa seen in non reducing SDS PAGE electrophoresis. The two heavy chains of Form B are presumably held together by strong non covalent e.g. ionic interactions associated with the CH3 domain region of the molecule. These mixtures of A and B forms are not present in solutions of MAb fragments that contain an intact hinge but lack a CH3 domain such as for example F ab fragments. Typically genetically engineered or enzymatically digested F ab MAb preparations lack the B form since the molecule lacks the necessary domains for maintaining non covalent interactions e.g. hydrogen bonding . However they are present in MAb preparations that do contain a CH3 domain such as IgG4 CH2 domain deleted MAb fragments e.g. as described in 02 060955 A2 and minibodies see e.g. Hu et al. 199656 3055 .

The application of protein engineering techniques to therapeutic antibody design has also produced a number of antibody formats that have been shown to have altered and in some cases improved pharmacodynamic biodistribution and activity profiles. Some altered antibody molecules have been made in which the number of cysteine residues in the hinge region is reduced to one to facilitate assembly of antibody molecules as it is only necessary to form a single disulfide bond. This also provides a specific target for attaching the hinge region either to another hinge region or to an effector or reporter molecule U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 425 . The number of cysteine residues in the antibody hinge has also been increased U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 425 . Other mutated antibodies have been constructed in which the IgG1 hinge region and the CH2 domain have been replaced with the human IgG3 hinge region WO 97 11370 . These molecules contain 11 sulfhydryl groups for substitution of multiple haptens via thiol groups.

CH2 domain deleted antibodies have a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa and have been shown to penetrate tumors significantly better than full length IgG. Minibodies which also have deletion of the CH2 domain have similar characteristics. These domain deleted molecules accumulate at tumor sites more efficiently than other MAb fragments such as F ab s but without the unfavorable pharmacodynamic profiles seen with intact IgG antibody. CH2 domain deleted antibodies consist of a VLCL light chain and a VH1 heavy chain domain and a portion of the hinge region e.g. the upper and middle hinge genetically fused either directly or through a modified peptide spacer to a CH3 domain. As an example the biosynthesis of recombinant CH2 domain deleted ddCC49 a domain deleted antibody that recognizes the tumor associated TAG72 antigen expressed on a variety of human carcinomas produces the A and B isoforms in approximately 50 50 distribution in cell cultures. Cells engineered to express alternative forms of CH2 domain deleted antibodies for example tetravalent CH2 domain deleted antibodies minibodies or tetravalent minibodies also express a mixture consisting of A and B isoforms and or monomeric half mer molecules.

Form A and Form B are extremely difficult to separate even after MAb purification since they are composed of identical amino acids and therefore have identical molecular weight and similar physical and chemical properties. They cannot be separated by standard gel filtration affinity chromatography or ion exchange chromatography typically used to purify antibody molecules including recombinant MAb proteins. Current manufacturing processes discard at least 50 of the total antibody produced having a negative impact on overall yield. Moreover the presence of the two isoforms increases efforts required for downstream processing.

The manufacture of a homogenous preparation of binding molecules is also important where the binding molecules are intended to bind to more than one type of target molecule. Such is the case with multispecific binding molecules which comprise binding sites with variable binding specificities. For example a single bispecific binding molecule is capable of binding to and or coupling two distinct target molecules that are not otherwise capable of being targeted by a single agent. To retain the desired bispecificity it is vital that bispecific dimeric polypeptides are prepared with minimal amount of Form B isoforms or monomeric half mer molecules as these contaminants lack the desired activity of a bispecific binding molecule. Accordingly methods which facilitate the preferential manufacture of Form A isoforms of bispecific binding molecules would be of great benefit.

The invention is based at least in part on the finding that in a composition comprising a mixture of multispecific dimeric polypeptide binding molecules comprising different isoforms molecules comprising two heavy chain portions in which a fraction of the binding molecules comprise two heavy chain portions that are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage Form A and a portion of the multispecific binding molecules comprise two heavy chain portions that are not linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage Form B one form or the other can be preferentially obtained e.g. by separation using hydrophobic interaction chromatography or by inclusion of synthetic connecting peptides which result in the preferential biosynthesis of either Form A or Form B.

In particular the instant invention is especially useful in producing multispecific molecules which are capable of binding to at least two target molecules. Preferably at least one of the first and second target molecules to which a multispecific binding molecule of the invention binds is a member of the TNF family of receptors TNFRs . In one embodiment at least one of the first and second target molecules to which a multispecific binding molecule of the invention binds is a tumor cell antigen. In another exemplary embodiment the first and second target molecules to which a multispecific binding molecule of the invention binds are both TNFRs. A limiting factor in the treatment of tumors with monospecific TNFR binding molecules is that often only a subset of tumors appear to be sensitive to such therapies. Multispecific TNFR binding molecules can specifically activate TNFRs and enhance receptor signaling by for example bringing the TNFRs into close proximity. The invention provides improved multispecific TNFR binding molecules which can target more than one TNFR or TNFR type and enhance signaling thus providing an improved method of treating disorders such as cancer.

Human immunoglobulins Igs including monoclonal antibodies MAbs can exist in two forms that are associated with hinge heterogeneity. In native solutions both of these forms are present as dimeric proteins each monomer comprising one heavy chain and one light chain . One immunoglobulin molecule comprises a stable four chain construct of approximately 150 160 kDa in which the dimers are held together by an interchain heavy chain disulfide bond Form A and one comprises form in which the dimers are not linked via interchain disulfide bonds Form B . Form B also forms a stable dimer under native conditions but can be identified under denaturing non reducing conditions in which the heavy chains dissociate yielding a 75 80 kDa molecule. These forms have been extremely difficult to separate even after MAb affinity purification.

The frequency of appearance of the B form in various intact IgG isotypes is due to but not limited to structural differences associated with the hinge region isotype of the MAb molecule. In fact a single amino acid substitution in the hinge region of the human IgG4 hinge can significantly reduce the appearance of the B form Angal et al. 1993. Molecular Immunology 30 105 to levels typically observed using a human IgG1 hinge. However applying this same amino acid substitution to MAb fragments in which the CH3 domain was retained did not eliminate Form B from preparations. Typically all recombinant CH2 domain deleted antibodies produced in cell cultures often result in hinge heterogeneity which is not corrected via similar molecular mutations in the hinge.

The instant invention advances the state of the art by providing methods of e.g. separating a first dimeric polypeptide from a second dimeric polypeptide wherein the first and second polypeptides comprise at least two polypeptide chains and at least two of the polypeptide chains comprise at least one heavy chain portion. In one embodiment the polypeptides of the invention lack all or part of a CH2 domain. The monomers are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage referred to herein as Form A and the monomers of the second polypeptide are not linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage referred to herein as Form B . These forms can be separated from each other using hydrophobic interaction chromatography. In addition the invention pertains to polypeptides that comprise connecting peptides. The inclusion of certain connecting peptides results in the preferential biosynthesis of polypeptide dimers comprising polypeptide chains that are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage or that are not linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage.

The instant invention is especially useful in producing multispecific e.g. bispecific molecules. Preferably at least one of the first and second target molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds is a member of the TNF family of receptors TNFRs . In another exemplary embodiment the first and second target molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds are both TNFRs. A limiting factor in the treatment of tumors with monospecific TNFR binding molecules is that often only a subset of tumors appears to be sensitive to such therapies. Multispecific TNFR binding molecules can specifically activate TNFRs and enhance receptor signaling by for example bringing the TNFRs into close proximity. The invention provides multispecific TNFR binding molecules which can target more than one TNFR or TNFR type and enhance signaling thus providing an improved method of treating cancer. As such multispecific TNFR binding molecules can deliver stronger or more complex signaling and are therefore more effective on a wider range of tumors. In one embodiment the multispecific TNFR binding molecule increases the signal strength by binding to two or more TNFRs of the same type increasing the number of TNFRs being brought together. In another more preferred embodiment the multispecific TNFR binding molecule is capable of binding to two different receptors of the TNF family forming novel heteromeric receptor complexes that embody novel signaling characteristics and or relocalize a receptor into an environment where signaling is more or less effective.

The polypeptides of the invention are binding molecules i.e. polypeptide molecules or the nucleic acid molecules that encode them that comprise at least one binding domain which comprises a binding site that specifically binds to a target molecule such as an antigen or binding partner . For example in one embodiment a binding molecule of the invention comprises an immunoglobulin antigen binding site or the portion of a receptor molecule responsible for ligand binding or the portion of a ligand molecule that is responsible for receptor binding. The binding molecules of the invention are polypeptides or the nucleic acid molecules which encode them.

In one embodiment the binding molecules comprise at least two binding sites. In one embodiment the binding molecules comprise two binding sites. In one embodiment the binding molecules comprise three binding sites. In another embodiment the binding molecules comprise four binding sites.

The polypeptides of the invention are multimers. For example in one embodiment the polypeptides of the invention are dimers. In one embodiment the dimers of the invention are homodimers comprising two identical monomeric subunits. In another embodiment the dimers of the invention are heterodimers comprising two non identical monomeric subunits. The subunits of the dimer may comprise one or more polypeptide chains. For example in one embodiment the dimers comprise at least two polypeptide chains. In one embodiment the dimers comprise two polypeptide chains. In another embodiment the dimers comprise four polypeptide chains e.g. as in the case of antibody molecules .

The polypeptides of the invention comprise at least one amino acid sequence derived from an immunoglobulin domain. A polypeptide or amino acid sequence derived from a designated protein refers to the origin of the polypeptide. Preferably the polypeptide or amino acid sequence which is derived from a particular starting polypeptide or amino acid sequence has an amino acid sequence that is essentially identical to that of the starting sequence or a portion thereof wherein the portion consists of at least 10 20 amino acids preferably at least 20 30 amino acids more preferably at least 30 50 amino acids or which is otherwise identifiable to one of ordinary skill in the art as having its origin in the starting sequence.

Preferred binding polypeptides comprise an amino acid sequence derived from a human amino acid sequence. However binding polypeptides may comprise one or more amino acids from another mammalian species. For example a primate heavy chain portion hinge portion or binding site may be included in the subject binding polypeptides and or connecting polypeptides. Alternatively one or more murine amino acids may be present in a binding polypeptide e.g. in an antigen binding site of a binding molecule. Preferred binding molecules of the invention are not immunogenic.

It will also be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the binding molecules of the invention e.g. the heavy chain or light chain portions or binding portions of the subject polypeptides may be modified such that they vary in amino acid sequence from the naturally occurring immunoglobulin molecule from which they were derived. For example nucleotide or amino acid substitutions leading to conservative substitutions or changes at non essential amino acid residues may be made.

An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a non natural variant of a polypeptide derived from an immunoglobulin e.g. an immunoglobulin heavy chain portion or light chain portion can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of the immunoglobulin such that one or more amino acid substitutions additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations may be introduced by standard techniques such as site directed mutagenesis and PCR mediated mutagenesis. Preferably conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more non essential amino acid residues. A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art including basic side chains e.g. lysine arginine histidine acidic side chains e.g. aspartic acid glutamic acid uncharged polar side chains e.g. glycine asparagine glutamine serine threonine tyrosine cysteine nonpolar side chains e.g. alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan beta branched side chains e.g. threonine valine isoleucine and aromatic side chains e.g. tyrosine phenylalanine tryptophan histidine . Thus a nonessential amino acid residue in an immunoglobulin polypeptide is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. In another embodiment a string of amino acids can be replaced with a structurally similar string that differs in order and or composition of side chain family members.

Alternatively in another embodiment mutations may be introduced randomly along all or part of the immunoglobulin coding sequence such as by saturation mutagenesis and the resultant mutants can be incorporated into polypeptides of the invention and screened for their ability to bind to the desired antigen.

As used herein the term heavy chain portion includes amino acid sequences derived from an immunoglobulin heavy chain. A polypeptide comprising a heavy chain portion comprises at least one of a CH1 domain a hinge e.g. upper middle and or lower hinge region domain a CH2 domain a CH3 domain or a variant or fragment thereof. In one embodiment a polypeptide of the invention comprises a polypeptide chain comprising a CH1 domain at least a portion of a hinge domain and a CH2 domain. In another embodiment a polypeptide of the invention comprises a polypeptide chain comprising a CH1 domain and a CH3 domain. In another embodiment a polypeptide of the invention comprises a polypeptide chain comprising a CH1 domain at least a portion of a hinge domain and a CH3 domain. In another embodiment a polypeptide of the invention comprises a polypeptide chain comprising a CH3 domain. In one embodiment a polypeptide of the invention lacks at least a portion of a CH2 domain e.g. all or part of a CH2 domain . In another embodiment a polypeptide of the invention comprises a complete Ig heavy chain. As set forth above it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that these domains e.g. the heavy chain portions may be modified such that they vary in amino acid sequence from the naturally occurring immunoglobulin molecule.

In one embodiment at least two of the polypeptide chains of a binding molecule of the invention comprise at least one heavy chain portion derived from an antibody or immunoglobulin molecule. In one embodiment at least two heavy chain portions of a polypeptide of the invention are present on different polypeptide chains and interact e.g. via at least one disulfide linkage Form A or via non covalent interactions Form B to form a dimeric polypeptide each monomer of the dimer comprising at least one heavy chain portion.

In one embodiment the heavy chain portions of one polypeptide chain of a dimer are identical to those on a second polypeptide chain of the dimer. In one embodiment the monomers or half mers of a dimer of the invention are identical to each other. In another embodiment they are not identical. For example each monomer may comprise a different target binding site.

In one embodiment a dimer of the invention is held together by covalent interactions e.g. disulfide bonds. In one embodiment a dimer of the invention is held together by one or more disulfide bonds. In another embodiment a dimer of the invention is held together by one or more preferably two disulfide bonds. In another embodiment a dimer of the invention is held together by one or more preferably three disulfide bonds.

In another embodiment a dimer of the invention is held together by one or more preferably ten disulfide bonds. In a further embodiment a dimer of the invention is not held together by disulfide bonds but is held together e.g. by non covalent interactions.

The heavy chain portions of a polypeptide may be derived from different immunoglobulin molecules. For example a heavy chain portion of a polypeptide may comprise a CH1 domain derived from an IgG1 molecule and a hinge region derived from an IgG3 molecule. In another example a heavy chain portion can comprise a hinge region derived in part from an IgG1 molecule and in part from an IgG3 molecule. In another example a heavy chain portion can comprise a chimeric hinge derived in part from an IgG1 molecule and in part from an IgG4 molecule. As used herein the term light chain portion includes amino acid sequences derived from an immunoglobulin light chain. Preferably the light chain portion comprises at least one of a VL or CL domain.

In one embodiment a polypeptide of the invention comprises an amino acid sequence or one or more moieties not derived from an Ig molecule. Exemplary modifications are described in more detail below. For example in one embodiment a polypeptide of the invention may comprise a flexible linker sequence. In another embodiment a polypeptide may be modified to add a functional moiety e.g. PEG a drug or a label .

In one embodiment a binding polypeptide of the invention is a fusion protein. Fusion proteins are chimeric molecules which comprise a binding domain comprising at least one target binding site and at least one heavy chain portion. In one embodiment a fusion protein further comprises a synthetic connecting peptide.

A chimeric protein comprises a first amino acid sequence linked to a second amino acid sequence with which it is not naturally linked in nature. The amino acid sequences may normally exist in separate proteins that are brought together in the fusion polypeptide or they may normally exist in the same protein but are placed in a new arrangement in the fusion polypeptide. A chimeric protein may be created for example by chemical synthesis or by creating and translating a polynucleotide in which the peptide regions are encoded in the desired relationship. Exemplary chimeric polypeptides include fusion proteins and the chimeric hinge connecting peptides of the invention.

The term heterologous as applied to a polynucleotide or a polypeptide means that the polynucleotide or polypeptide is derived from a genotypically distinct entity from that of the rest of the entity to which it is being compared. For instance a heterologous polynucleotide or antigen may be derived from a different species origin different cell type or the same type of cell of distinct individuals.

The term ligand binding domain or ligand binding portion of a receptor as used herein refers to any native receptor e.g. cell surface receptor or any region or derivative thereof retaining at least a qualitative ligand binding ability and preferably the biological activity of a corresponding native receptor.

The term receptor binding domain or receptor binding portion of a ligand as used herein refers to any native ligand or any region or derivative thereof retaining at least a qualitative receptor binding ability and preferably the biological activity of a corresponding native ligand.

In one embodiment a binding molecule of the invention is a fusion protein. A fusion protein of the invention is a chimeric molecule that comprises a binding domain which comprises at least one binding site and a dimerization domain which comprises at least one heavy chain portion . The heavy chain portion may be from any immunoglobulin such as IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 subtypes IgA IgE IgD or IgM.

In another embodiment of the invention a binding molecule is an antibody fusion protein chimera. Such molecules comprise a molecule which combines at least one binding domain of an antibody with at least one fusion protein. Preferably the interface between the two polypeptides is a CH3 domain of an immunoglobulin molecule.

In one embodiment the binding molecules of the invention are antibody or immunoglobulin molecules e.g. naturally occurring antibody or immunoglobulin molecules or genetically engineered antibody molecules that bind antigen in a manner similar to antibody molecules. As used herein the term immunoglobulin includes a polypeptide having a combination of two heavy and two light chains whether or not it possesses any relevant specific immunoreactivity. Antibodies refers to such assemblies which have significant known specific immunoreactive activity to an antigen of interest e.g. a tumor associated antigen . Antibodies and immunoglobulins comprise light and heavy chains with or without an interchain covalent linkage between them. Basic immunoglobulin structures in vertebrate systems are relatively well understood.

As will be discussed in more detail below the generic term immunoglobulin comprises five distinct classes of antibody that can be distinguished biochemically. All five classes of antibodies are clearly within the scope of the present invention the following discussion will generally be directed to the IgG class of immunoglobulin molecules. With regard to IgG immunoglobulins comprise two identical light polypeptide chains of molecular weight approximately 23 000 Daltons and two identical heavy chains of molecular weight 53 000 70 000. The four chains are joined by disulfide bonds in a Y configuration wherein the light chains bracket the heavy chains starting at the mouth of the Y and continuing through the variable region.

Both the light and heavy chains are divided into regions of structural and functional homology. The terms constant and variable are used functionally. In this regard it will be appreciated that the variable domains of both the light VL and heavy VH chain portions determine antigen recognition and specificity. Conversely the constant domains of the light chain CL and the heavy chain CH1 CH2 or CH3 confer important biological properties such as secretion transplacental mobility Fc receptor binding complement binding and the like. By convention the numbering of the constant region domains increases as they become more distal from the antigen binding site or amino terminus of the antibody. The N terminus is a variable region and at the C terminus is a constant region the CH3 and CL domains actually comprise the carboxy terminus of the heavy and light chain respectively.

Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda . Each heavy chain class may be bound with either a kappa or lambda light chain. In general the light and heavy chains are covalently bonded to each other and the tail portions of the two heavy chains are bonded to each other by covalent disulfide linkages or non covalent linkages when the immunoglobulins are generated either by hybridomas B cells or genetically engineered host cells. In the heavy chain the amino acid sequences run from an N terminus at the forked ends of the Y configuration to the C terminus at the bottom of each chain. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that heavy chains are classified as gamma mu alpha delta or epsilon with some subclasses among them e.g. 1 4 . It is the nature of this chain that determines the class of the antibody as IgG IgM IgA IgG or IgE respectively. The immunoglobulin subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA etc. are well characterized and are known to confer functional specialization. Modified versions of each of these classes and isotypes are readily discernable to the skilled artisan in view of the instant disclosure and accordingly are within the scope of the instant invention.

As indicated above the variable region allows the antibody to selectively recognize and specifically bind epitopes on antigens. That is the Vdomain and Vdomain of an antibody combine to form the variable region that defines a three dimensional antigen binding site. This quaternary antibody structure forms the antigen binding site present at the end of each arm of the Y. More specifically the antigen binding site is defined by three complementary determining regions CDRs on each of the Vand Vchains.

As used herein the term binding site or binding domain comprises a region of a polypeptide which is responsible for selectively binding to a target molecule of interest e.g. an antigen ligand receptor substrate or inhibitor . Exemplary binding domains include an antibody variable domain a receptor binding domain of a ligand a ligand binding domain of a receptor or an enzymatic domain.

In one embodiment the binding molecules have at least one binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination e.g. a cell surface antigen or a soluble antigen.

In preferred embodiments the binding domain is an antigen binding site. An antigen binding site is formed by variable regions that vary from one polypeptide to another. In one embodiment the polypeptides of the invention comprise at least two antigen binding sites. As used herein the term antigen binding site includes a site that specifically binds immunoreacts with an antigen e.g. a cell surface or soluble antigen . The antigen binding site includes an immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable region and the binding site formed by these variable regions determines the specificity of the antibody. In one embodiment an antigen binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one heavy or light chain CDR of an antibody molecule e.g. the sequence of which is known in the art or described herein . In another embodiment an antigen binding molecule of the invention comprises at least two CDRs from one or more antibody molecules. In another embodiment an antigen binding molecule of the invention comprises at least three CDRs from one or more antibody molecules. In another embodiment an antigen binding molecule of the invention comprises at least four CDRs from one or more antibody molecules. In another embodiment an antigen binding molecule of the invention comprises at least five CDRs from one or more antibody molecules. In another embodiment an antigen binding molecule of the invention comprises at least six CDRs from one or more antibody molecules. Exemplary antibody molecules comprising at least one CDR that can be included in the subject antigen binding molecules are known in the art and exemplary molecules are described herein.

The polypeptides comprising two heavy chain portions disclosed herein may be linked to form two associated Ys so there will be four binding sites forming a tetravalent molecule see e.g. WO02 096948A2 . In another embodiment tetravalent minibodies or domain deleted antibodies can be made.

The term multispecific includes binding molecules having specificity for more than one target antigen. Such molecules have more than one binding site where each binding site specifically binds e.g. immunoreacts with a different target molecule or a different antigenic site on the same target.

In one embodiment a multispecific binding molecule of the invention is a bispecific molecule e.g. antibody minibody domain deleted antibody or fusion protein having binding specificity for at least two targets e.g. more than one target molecule or more than one epitope on the same target molecule. In one embodiment a bispecific molecule has at least one binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination and a target molecule on a cell. In another embodiment a bispecific molecules has at least one target binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination and at least one binding site specific for a drug. In yet another embodiment a bispecific molecule has at least one binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination and at least one binding site specific for a prodrug.

In one embodiment a bispecific molecule comprises one specificity for a soluble molecule and one specificity for a cell surface molecule. In another embodiment a bispecific molecule has two binding specificities for two targets present on one or more soluble molecules. In another embodiment a bispecific molecule has two binding specificities for two targets present on one or more cell surface molecules.

In a preferred embodiment a bispecific molecule is a tetravalent antibody that has four binding sites. A tetravalent bispecific molecule may is bivalent for each specificity. Further description of bispecific molecules is provided below.

As used herein the term valency refers to the number of potential target binding sites in a polypeptide. Each target binding site specifically binds one target molecule or specific site on a target molecule. When a polypeptide comprises more than one target binding site each target binding site may specifically bind the same or different molecules e.g. may bind to different ligands or different antigens or different epitopes on the same antigen .

In naturally occurring antibodies the six CDRs present on each monomeric antibody are short non contiguous sequences of amino acids that are specifically positioned to form the antigen binding site as the antibody assumes its three dimensional configuration in an aqueous environment. The remainder of the heavy and light variable domains show less inter molecular variability in amino acid sequence and are termed the framework regions. The framework regions largely adopt a sheet conformation and the CDRs form loops which connect and in some cases form part of the sheet structure. Thus these framework regions act to form a scaffold that provides for positioning the six CDRs in correct orientation by inter chain non covalent interactions. The antigen binding site formed by the positioned CDRs defines a surface complementary to the epitope on the immunoreactive antigen. This complementary surface promotes the non covalent binding of the antibody to the immunoreactive antigen epitope. The position of CDRs can be readily identified by one of ordinary skill in the art.

As previously indicated the subunit structures and three dimensional configuration of the constant regions of the various immunoglobulin classes are well known. As used herein the term VH domain includes the amino terminal variable domain of an immunoglobulin heavy chain and the term CH1 domain includes the first most amino terminal constant region domain of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. The CH1 domain is adjacent to the VH domain and is amino terminal to the hinge region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain molecule.

As used herein the term CH2 domain includes the portion of a heavy chain molecule that extends e.g. from about residue 244 to residue 360 of an antibody using conventional numbering schemes residues 244 to 360 Kabat numbering system and residues 231 340 EU numbering system Kabat E A et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. Bethesda US Department of Health and Human Services NIH. 1991 . The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather two N linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG molecule. It is also well documented that the CH3 domain extends from the CH2 domain to the C terminal of the IgG molecule and comprises approximately 108 residues.

As used herein the term hinge region includes the portion of a heavy chain molecule that joins the CH1 domain to the CH2 domain. This hinge region comprises approximately 25 residues and is flexible thus allowing the two N terminal antigen binding regions to move independently. Hinge regions can be subdivided into three distinct domains upper middle and lower hinge domains Roux et al. J. Immunol. 1998 161 4083 .

In one embodiment a binding molecule of the invention comprises a connecting peptide. The connecting peptides of the invention are synthetic. As used herein the term synthetic with respect to polypeptides includes polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence that is not naturally occurring. For example non naturally occurring polypeptides which are modified forms of naturally occurring polypeptides e.g. comprising a mutation such as an addition substitution or deletion or which comprise a first amino acid sequence which may or may not be naturally occurring that is linked in a linear sequence of amino acids to a second amino acid sequence which may or may not be naturally occurring to which it is not naturally linked in nature.

Connecting peptides of the invention connect two domains e.g. a binding domain and a dimerization domain of a binding molecule of the invention. For example connecting peptides connect a heavy chain portion to a binding domain comprising a binding site. In one embodiment a connecting peptide connects two heavy chain constant region domains such as CH1 and CH2 domains CH1 and CH3 domains hinge and CH1 domains hinge and CH3 domains VH and hinge domains or a CH3 domain and a non immunoglobulin polypeptide in a linear amino acid sequence of a polypeptide chain. Preferably such connecting peptides provide flexibility to the polypeptide molecule and facilitate dimerization via disulfide bonding. In one embodiment the connecting peptides of the invention are used to replace one or more heavy chain domains e.g. at least a portion of a constant region domain e.g. at least a portion of a CH2 domain and or at least a portion of the hinge region e.g. at least a portion of the lower hinge region domain in a domain deleted construct . For example in one embodiment a VH domain is fused to a CH3 domain via a connecting peptide the C terminus of the connecting peptide is attached to the N terminus of the CH3 domain and the N terminus of the connecting peptide is attached to the C terminus of the VH domain . In another embodiment a VL domain is fused to a CH3 domain via a connecting peptide the C terminus of the connecting peptide is attached to the N terminus of the CH3 domain and the N terminus of the connecting peptide is attached to the C terminus of the VL domain. In another embodiment a CH1 domain is fused to a CH3 domain via a connecting peptide the C terminus of the connecting peptide is attached to the N terminus of the CH3 domain and the N terminus of the connecting peptide is attached to the C terminus of the CH1 domain .

In one embodiment a synthetic connecting peptide comprises a portion of a constant region domain. For example in one embodiment a connecting peptide that replaces a CH2 domain can comprise a portion of the CH2 domain.

In one embodiment a connecting peptide comprises or consists of a gly ser linker. As used herein the term gly ser linker refers to a peptide that consists of glycine and serine residues An exemplary gly ser linker comprises the amino acid sequence GGGSSGGGSG SEQ ID NO 1 . In one embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention comprises at least a portion of an upper hinge region e.g. derived from an IgG1 IgG3 or IgG4 molecule at least a portion of a middle hinge region e.g. derived from an IgG1 IgG3 or IgG4 molecule and a series of gly ser amino acid residues e.g. a gly ser linker such as GGGSSGGGSG SEQ ID NO 1 . In one embodiment the connecting peptide comprises a substitution of one or more amino acids as compared to naturally occurring IgG1 or IgG3 hinge regions. In another embodiment a connecting peptide comprises an amino acid sequence such as described in WO 02 060955. Connecting peptides are described in more detail below.

As used herein the term disulfide bond includes the covalent bond formed between two sulfur atoms. The amino acid cysteine comprises a thiol group that can form a disulfide bond or bridge with a second thiol group. In most naturally occurring IgG molecules the CH1 and CL regions are linked by a disulfide bond and the two heavy chains are linked by two disulfide bonds at positions corresponding to 239 and 242 using the Kabat numbering system position 226 or 229 EU numbering system .

It is known in the art that the constant region mediates several effector functions. For example binding of the C1 component of complement to antibodies activates the complement system. Activation of complement is important in the opsonisation and lysis of cell pathogens. The activation of complement also stimulates the inflammatory response and may also be involved in autoimmune hypersensitivity. Further antibodies bind to cells via the Fc region with a Fc receptor site on the antibody Fc region binding to a Fc receptor FcR on a cell. There are a number of Fc receptors which are specific for different classes of antibody including IgG gamma receptors IgE epsilon receptors IgA alpha receptors and IgM mu receptors . Binding of antibody to Fc receptors on cell surfaces triggers a number of important and diverse biological responses including engulfment and destruction of antibody coated particles clearance of immune complexes lysis of antibody coated target cells by killer cells called antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC release of inflammatory mediators placental transfer and control of immunoglobulin production.

In one embodiment the Fc portion may be mutated to decrease effector function using techniques known in the art. For example the deletion or inactivation through point mutations or other means of a constant region domain may reduce Fc receptor binding of the circulating modified antibody thereby increasing tumor localization. In other cases it may be that constant region modifications consistent with the instant invention moderate compliment binding and thus reduce the serum half life and nonspecific association of a conjugated cytotoxin. Yet other modifications of the constant region may be used to modify disulfide linkages or oligosaccharide moieties that allow for enhanced localization due to increased antigen specificity or antibody flexibility. More generally those skilled in the art will realize that antibodies modified as described herein may exert a number of subtle effects that may or may not be readily appreciated. However the resulting physiological profile bioavailability and other biochemical effects of the modifications such as tumor localization biodistribution and serum half life may easily be measured and quantified using well know immunological techniques without undue experimentation.

In one embodiment modified forms of antibodies can be made from a whole precursor or parent antibody using techniques known in the art. Exemplary techniques are discussed in more detail below. In particularly preferred embodiments both the variable and constant regions of polypeptides of the invention are human. In one embodiment fully human antibodies can be made using techniques that are known in the art. For example fully human antibodies against a specific antigen can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal which has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge but whose endogenous loci have been disabled. Exemplary techniques that can be used to make antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 150 584 6 458 592 6 420 140. Other techniques are known in the art.

A polypeptide comprising a heavy chain portion may or may not comprise other amino acid sequences or moieties not derived from an immunoglobulin molecule. Such modifications are described in more detail below. For example in one embodiment a polypeptide of the invention may comprise a flexible linker sequence. In another embodiment a polypeptide may be modified to add a functional moiety such as PEG.

The polypeptides of the instant invention comprise at least two binding sites that provide for the association of the polypeptide with the selected target molecule.

In one embodiment a binding molecule of the invention comprises an antibody molecule e.g. an intact antibody molecule or a fragment of an antibody molecule. In another embodiment binding molecule of the invention is a modified or synthetic antibody molecule. In one embodiment a binding molecule of the invention comprises all or a portion of e.g. at least one antigen binding site from at least one CDR from or at least one heavy chain portion from a monoclonal antibody a humanized antibody a chimeric antibody or a recombinantly produced antibody.

In embodiments where the binding molecule is an antibody or modified antibody the antigen binding site and the heavy chain portions need not be derived from the same immunoglobulin molecule. In this regard the variable region may or be derived from any type of animal that can be induced to mount a humoral response and generate immunoglobulins against the desired antigen. As such the variable region of the polypeptides may be for example of mammalian origin e.g. may be human murine non human primate such as cynomolgus monkeys macaques etc. lupine camelid e.g. from camels llamas and related species . In another embodiment the variable region may be condricthoid in origin e.g. from sharks .

Polypeptides of the invention can be made using techniques that are known in the art. In one embodiment the polypeptides of the invention are antibody molecules that have been recombinantly produced i.e. are produced using recombinant DNA technology. Exemplary techniques for making antibody molecules are discussed in more detail below.

In one embodiment the polypeptides of the invention are modified antibodies. As used herein the term modified antibody includes synthetic forms of antibodies which are altered such that they are not naturally occurring e.g. antibodies that comprise at least two heavy chain portions but not two complete heavy chains such as domain deleted antibodies or minibodies multispecific forms of antibodies e.g. bispecific trispecific etc. altered to bind to two or more different antigens or to different epitopes on a single antigen heavy chain molecules joined to scFv molecules and the like. ScFv molecules are known in the art and are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 5 892 019. In addition the term modified antibody includes multivalent forms of antibodies e.g. trivalent tetravalent etc. antibodies that bind to three or more copies of the same antigen . In another embodiment a binding molecule of the invention is a fusion protein comprising at least one heavy chain portion lacking a CH2 domain and comprising a binding domain of a polypeptide comprising the binding portion of one member of a ligand and its receptor.

In one embodiment the term modified antibody according to the present invention includes immunoglobulins antibodies or immunoreactive fragments or recombinants thereof in which at least a fraction of one or more of the constant region domains has been deleted or otherwise altered so as to provide desired biochemical characteristics such as the ability to non covalently dimerize increased ability to localize at the site of a tumor or reduced serum half life when compared with a whole unaltered antibody of approximately the same immunogenicity. In a preferred embodiment the polypeptides of the present invention are domain deleted antibodies which comprise a polypeptide chain similar to an immunoglobulin heavy chain but which lack at least a portion of one or more heavy chain domains. More preferably one entire domain of the constant region of the modified antibody will be deleted and even more preferably all or part of the CH2 domain will be deleted.

In preferred embodiments a polypeptide of the invention will not elicit a deleterious immune response in a human. Modifications to the constant region compatible with the instant invention comprise additions deletions or substitutions of one or more amino acids in one or more domains. That is the polypeptides of the invention disclosed herein may comprise alterations or modifications to one or more of the three heavy chain constant domains CH1 CH2 or CH3 and or to the light chain constant region domain CL .

In one embodiment the polypeptides of the invention may be modified to reduce their immunogenicity using art recognized techniques. For example antibodies or polypeptides of the invention can be humanized deimmunized or chimeric antibodies can be made. These types of antibodies are derived from a non human antibody typically a murine antibody that retains or substantially retains the antigen binding properties of the parent antibody but which is less immunogenic in humans. This may be achieved by various methods including a grafting the entire non human variable domains onto human constant regions to generate chimeric antibodies b grafting at least a part of one or more of the non human complementarity determining regions CDRs into a human framework and constant regions with or without retention of critical framework residues or c transplanting the entire non human variable domains but cloaking them with a human like section by replacement of surface residues. Such methods are disclosed in Morrison et al. 81 6851 5 1984 Morrison et al. 44 65 92 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 Padlan 28 489 498 1991 Padlan 31 169 217 1994 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 585 089 5 693 761 and 5 693 762 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

De immunization can also be used to decrease the immunogenicity of an antibody. As used herein the term de immunization includes alteration of an antibody to modify T cell epitopes see e.g. WO9852976A1 WO0034317A2 . For example VH and VL sequences from the starting antibody are analyzed and a human T cell epitope map from each V region showing the location of epitopes in relation to complementarity determining regions CDRs and other key residues within the sequence Individual T cell epitopes from the T cell epitope map are analyzed in order to identify alternative amino acid substitutions with a low risk of altering activity of the final antibody. A range of alternative VH and VL sequences are designed comprising combinations of amino acid substitutions and these sequences are subsequently incorporated into a range of polypeptides of the invention that are tested for function. Typically between 12 and 24 variant antibodies are generated and tested. Complete heavy and light chain genes comprising modified V and human C regions are then cloned into expression vectors and the subsequent plasmids introduced into cell lines for the production of whole antibody. The antibodies are then compared in appropriate biochemical and biological assays and the optimal variant is identified. In one embodiment the binding molecule comprises a chimeric antibody. In the context of the present application the term chimeric antibodies will be held to mean any antibody wherein the immunoreactive region or site is obtained or derived from a first species and the constant region which may be intact partial or modified in accordance with the instant invention is obtained from a second species. In preferred embodiments the target binding region or site will be from a non human source e.g. mouse and the constant region is human. Preferably the variable domains in both the heavy and light chains are altered by at least partial replacement of one or more CDRs and if necessary by partial framework region replacement and sequence changing. Although the CDRs may be derived from an antibody of the same class or even subclass as the antibody from which the framework regions are derived it is envisaged that the CDRs will be derived from an antibody of different class and preferably from an antibody from a different species. It may not be necessary to replace all of the CDRs with the complete CDRs from the donor variable region to transfer the antigen binding capacity of one variable domain to another. Rather it may only be necessary to transfer those residues that are necessary to maintain the activity of the target binding site. Given the explanations set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 585 089 5 693 761 and 5 693 762 it will be well within the competence of those skilled in the art either by carrying out routine experimentation or by trial and error testing to obtain a functional antibody with reduced immunogenicity.

As used herein the term properly folded polypeptide includes polypeptides e.g. antigen binding molecules such as antibodies in which all of the functional domains comprising the polypeptide are distinctly active. As used herein the term improperly folded polypeptide includes polypeptides in which at least one of the functional domains of the polypeptide is not active.

As used herein the term engineered includes manipulation of nucleic acid or polypeptide molecules by synthetic means e.g. by recombinant techniques in vitro peptide synthesis by enzymatic or chemical coupling of peptides or some combination of these techniques . Preferably the binding molecules of the invention are engineered e.g. to express a connecting peptide of the invention.

As used herein the terms linked fused or fusion are used interchangeably. These terms refer to the joining together of two more elements or components by whatever means including chemical conjugation or recombinant means. An in frame fusion refers to the joining of two or more open reading frames ORFs to form a continuous longer ORF in a manner that maintains the correct reading frame of the original ORFs. Thus the resulting recombinant fusion protein is a single protein containing two or more segments that correspond to polypeptides encoded by the original ORFs which segments are not normally so joined in nature. Although the reading frame is thus made continuous throughout the fused segments the segments may be physically or spatially separated by for example in frame linker sequence.

In the context of polypeptides a linear sequence or a sequence is an order of amino acids in a polypeptide in an amino to carboxyl terminal direction in which residues that neighbor each other in the sequence are contiguous in the primary structure of the polypeptide.

As used herein the phrase subject that would benefit from administration of a binding molecule includes subjects such as mammalian subjects that would benefit from administration of a binding molecule used e.g. for detection of an antigen recognized by a binding molecule e.g. for a diagnostic procedure and or from treatment with a binding molecule to reduce or eliminate the target recognized by the binding molecule. For example in one embodiment the subject may benefit from reduction or elimination of a soluble or particulate molecule from the circulation or serum e.g. a toxin or pathogen or from reduction or elimination of a population of cells expressing the target e.g. tumor cells . As described in more detail herein the binding molecule can be used in unconjugated form or can be conjugated e.g. to a drug prodrug or an isotope.

The term apoptosis or apoptotic cell death as used herein includes programmed cell death which can be characterized using techniques which are known in the art. Apoptotic cell death can be characterized e.g. by cell shrinkage membrane blebbing and chromatin condensation culminating in cell fragmentation. Cells undergoing apoptosis also display a characteristic pattern of internucleosomal DNA cleavage. As used herein the term modulates apoptosis includes either up regulation or down regulation of apoptosis in a cell.

The term TNF receptor or TNF receptor family member refers to any receptor belonging to the Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF superfamily of receptors. Members of the TNF Receptor Superfamily TNFRSF are characterized by an extracellular region with two or more cysteine rich domains 40 amino acids each arranged as cysteine knots see Dempsey et al. . 2003 . 14 3 4 193 209 . Upon binding their cognate TNF ligands TNF receptors transduce signals by interacting directly or indirectly with cytoplasmic adapter proteins known as TRAFs TNF receptor associate factors .

At least one polypeptide chain of a dimer of the invention can comprise a synthetic connecting peptide of the invention. In one embodiment at least two chains of a dimer of the invention comprise a connecting peptide. In a preferred embodiment two chains of a dimer of the invention comprise a connecting peptide.

In one embodiment connecting peptides can be used to join two heavy chain portions in frame in a single polypeptide chain. For example in one embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention can be used to fuse a CH3 domain or synthetic CH3 domain to a hinge region or synthetic hinge region . In another embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention can be used to fuse a CH3 domain or synthetic CH3 domain to a CH1 domain or synthetic CH1 domain . In still another embodiment a connecting peptide can act as a peptide spacer between the hinge region or synthetic hinge region and a CH2 domain or a synthetic CH2 domain .

In another embodiment a CH3 domain can be fused to an extracellular protein domain e.g. a VL domain or synthetic domain a VH domain or synthetic domain a CH1 domain or synthetic domain a hinge domain or synthetic hinge or to the ligand binding portion of a receptor or the receptor binding portion of a ligand . For example in one embodiment a VH or VL domain is fused to a CH3 domain via a connecting peptide the C terminus of the connecting peptide is attached to the N terminus of the CH3 domain and the N terminus of the connecting peptide is attached to the C terminus of the VH or VL domain . In another embodiment a CH1 domain is fused to a CH3 domain via a connecting peptide the C terminus of the connecting peptide is attached to the N terminus of the CH3 domain and the N terminus of the connecting peptide is attached to the C terminus of the CH1 domain . In another embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention can be used to fuse a CH3 domain or synthetic CH3 domain to a hinge region or synthetic hinge region or portion thereof. In still another embodiment a connecting peptide can act as a peptide spacer between the hinge region or synthetic hinge region and a CH2 domain or a synthetic CH2 domain .

In one embodiment a connecting peptide can comprise or consist of a gly ser spacer. For example a domain deleted CC49 construct having a short amino acid spacer GGSSGGGGSG SEQ. ID No. 37 substituted for the CH2 domain and the lower hinge region CC49. CH2 gly ser can be used. In another embodiment a connecting peptide comprises the amino acid sequence IGKTISKKAK SEQ ID NO 16 .

In another embodiment connecting peptide can comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin hinge region. For example chimeric hinge domains can be constructed which combine hinge elements derived from different antibody isotypes. In one embodiment a connecting peptide comprises at least a portion of an IgG1 hinge region. In another embodiment a connecting peptide can comprise at least a portion of an IgG3 hinge region. In another embodiment a connecting peptide can comprise at least a portion of an IgG1 hinge region and at least a portion of an IgG3 hinge region. In one embodiment a connecting peptide can comprise an IgG1 upper and middle hinge and a single IgG3 middle hinge repeat motif.

Because the numbering of individual amino acids in such connecting peptides comprising an amino acid sequence derived from an immunoglobulin hinge region may vary depending upon the length of the connecting peptide the numbering of amino acid positions in these molecules is given using Kabat numbering see e.g. Table 2 . Table 1 shows naturally occurring hinge sequence for IgG1 IgG3 and IgG4 molecules. Table 2 shows Kabat numbering for portions of these hinge molecules and also shows Kabat numbering for connecting peptide amino acid residues presented in that table.

In one embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention comprises a non naturally occurring immunoglobulin hinge region domain e.g. a hinge region domain that is not naturally found in the polypeptide comprising the hinge region domain and or a hinge region domain that has been altered so that it differs in amino acid sequence from a naturally occurring immunoglobulin hinge region domain. In one embodiment mutations can be made to hinge region domains to make a connecting peptide of the invention. In one embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention comprises a hinge domain which does not comprise a naturally occurring number of cysteines i.e. the connecting peptide comprises either fewer cysteines or a greater number of cysteines than a naturally occurring hinge molecule. In a preferred embodiment incorporation of a connecting peptide e.g. comprising a non naturally occurring number of cysteines into a polypeptide results in a composition in which greater than 50 60 70 80 or 90 of the dimeric molecules present in a form in which the two heavy chain portions are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage.

In one embodiment of the invention a connecting peptide comprises hinge region domain comprising a proline residue at an amino acid position corresponding to amino acid position 243 in the Kabat numbering system position 230 EU numbering system . In one embodiment a connecting peptide comprises an alanine residue at an amino acid position corresponding to position 244 Kabat numbering system position 246 EU numbering system . In another embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention comprises a proline residue at an amino acid position corresponding to position 245 Kabat numbering system position 247 EU numbering system . In one embodiment a connecting peptide comprises a cysteine residue at an amino acid position corresponding to position 239 Kabat numbering system position 226 EU numbering system . In one embodiment a connecting peptide comprises a serine residue at an amino acid position corresponding to position 239 Kabat numbering system position 226 EU numbering system . In one embodiment a connecting peptide comprises a cysteine residue at an amino acid position corresponding to position 242 Kabat numbering system position 229 EU numbering system . In one embodiment a connecting peptide comprises a serine residue at an amino acid position corresponding to position 242 Kabat numbering system position 229 EU numbering system .

In one embodiment the connecting peptide can be chosen to result in the preferential synthesis of a particular isoform of polypeptide e.g. in which the two heavy chain portions are linked via disulfide bonds or are not linked via disulfide bonds. For example as described in the instant examples the G1 G3 Pro243 gly ser linker SEQ ID NO 8 G1 G3 Pro243Ala244Pro245 gly ser linker SEQ ID NO 9 Pro243 gly ser linker SEQ ID NO 15 and Pro243Ala244Pro245 gly ser linker SEQ ID NO 14 connecting peptides resulted in the production of only Form A CH2 domain deleted antibody with no detectable Form B. In contrast CH2 domain deleted Cys242Ser Pro243 SEQ ID NO 12 and CH2 domain deleted Cys242Ser Pro243Ala244Pro245 SEQ ID NO 13 both resulted in a preference for the Form B isoform. These synthetic hinge region connecting peptides would thus be useful for favoring synthesis of Form A or B isoform. This is true for any isotype of antibody e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 based on the high degree of homology among the CH3 domains for all four human isotypes. Including identical and conserved amino acid residues IgG1 CH3 domain is 98.13 homologous to IgG2 CH3 97.20 homologous to IgG3 CH3 and 96.26 homologous to IgG4 CH3 . The parentheticals referring to connecting peptides and various binding molecules of the invention represent equivalent terminology unless otherwise indicated.

In one embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention comprises a hinge region domain followed by a flexible gly ser linker. Exemplary connecting peptides are shown in Table 2 and in SEQ ID NOs 7 15 and 23. It will be understood that variant forms of these exemplary connecting peptides can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence encoding a connecting peptide such that one or more amino acid substitutions additions or deletions are introduced into the connecting peptide. For example mutations may be introduced by standard techniques such as site directed mutagenesis and PCR mediated mutagenesis. Preferably conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more non essential amino acid residues such that the ability of the connecting peptide to preferentially enhance synthesis of Form A or Form B is not altered. A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art including basic side chains e.g. lysine arginine histidine acidic side chains e.g. aspartic acid glutamic acid uncharged polar side chains e.g. glycine asparagine glutamine serine threonine tyrosine cysteine nonpolar side chains e.g. alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan beta branched side chains e.g. threonine valine isoleucine and aromatic side chains e.g. tyrosine phenylalanine tryptophan histidine . Thus a nonessential amino acid residue in an immunoglobulin polypeptide is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. In another embodiment a string of amino acids can be replaced with a structurally similar string that differs in order and or composition of side chain family members.

Connecting peptides of the invention can be of varying lengths. In one embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention is from about 15 to about 50 amino acids in length. In another embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention is from about 20 to about 45 amino acids in length. In another embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention is from about 25 to about 40 amino acids in length.

In another embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention is from about 24 to about 27 amino acids in length. In another embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention is from about 40 to about 42 amino acids in length.

Connecting peptides can be introduced into polypeptide sequences using techniques known in the art. For example in one embodiment the Splicing by Overlap Extension SOE method Horton R. M. 1993 Methods in Molecular Biology Vol 15 PCR Protocols Current Methods and applications. Ed. B. A. White can be used. Modifications can be confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA can be used to transform host cells for stable production of the polypeptides produced.

In one embodiment a fusion protein combines the binding domain s of the ligand or receptor e.g. the extracellular domain ECD of a receptor with at least one heavy chain domain and a synthetic connecting peptide. In one embodiment when preparing the fusion proteins of the present invention nucleic acid encoding the binding domain of the ligand or receptor will be fused C terminally to nucleic acid encoding the N terminus of an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. N terminal fusions are also possible. In one embodiment a fusion protein includes a CH2 and a CH3 domain. Fusions may also be made to the C terminus of the Fc portion of a constant domain or immediately N terminal to the CH1 of the heavy chain or the corresponding region of the light chain.

In one embodiment the sequence of the ligand or receptor domain is fused to the N terminus of the Fc domain of an immunoglobulin molecule. It is also possible to fuse the entire heavy chain constant region to the sequence of the ligand or receptor domain. In one embodiment a sequence beginning in the hinge region just upstream of the papain cleavage site which defines IgG Fc chemically i.e. residue 216 taking the first residue of heavy chain constant region to be 114 or analogous sites of other immunoglobulins is used in the fusion. The precise site at which the fusion is made is not critical particular sites are well known and may be selected in order to optimize the biological activity secretion or binding characteristics of the molecule. Methods for making fusion proteins are known in the art.

For bispecific fusion proteins the fusion proteins are assembled as multimers and particularly as heterodimers or heterotetramers. Generally these assembled immunoglobulins will have known unit structures. A basic four chain structural unit is the form in which IgG IgD and IgE exist. A four chain unit is repeated in the higher molecular weight immunoglobulins IgM generally exists as a pentamer of four basic units held together by disulfide bonds. IgA globulin and occasionally IgG globulin may also exist in multimeric form in serum. In the case of multimer each of the four units may be the same or different.

In another embodiment both IGFR1 and VEGF are targeted. In yet another embodiment VLA4 and VEGF are targeted.

Other cell surface receptors and or their ligands can also be targeted e.g. the TNF family receptors or their ligands as described in more detail herein .

Exemplary growth hormones or molecules which bind to them for use as targeting agents in the binding molecule of the invention include renin human growth hormone HGH U.S. Pat.

Another exemplary molecule that may be included in a binding molecule of the invention is immunoglobulin super family member 9 IGSF9 Genomics. 2002. 79 663 70 .

Fusion proteins are taught e.g. in WO0069913A1 and WO0040615A2. Fusion proteins can be prepared using methods that are well known in the art see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 116 964 and 5 225 538 . Ordinarily the ligand or receptor domain is fused C terminally to the N terminus of the constant region of the heavy chain or heavy chain portion and in place of the variable region. Any transmembrane regions or lipid or phospholipids anchor recognition sequences of ligand binding receptor are preferably inactivated or deleted prior to fusion. DNA encoding the ligand or receptor domain is cleaved by a restriction enzyme at or proximal to the 5 and 3 ends of the DNA encoding the desired ORF segment. The resultant DNA fragment is then readily inserted into DNA encoding a heavy chain constant region. The precise site at which the fusion is made may be selected empirically to optimize the secretion or binding characteristics of the soluble fusion protein. DNA encoding the fusion protein is then transfected into a host cell for expression.

In one embodiment a binding molecule e.g. antigen binding molecule of the invention is an antibody molecule. Using art recognized protocols for example antibodies are preferably raised in mammals by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of the relevant antigen e.g. purified tumor associated antigens or cells or cellular extracts comprising such antigens and an adjuvant. This immunization typically elicits an immune response that comprises production of antigen reactive antibodies from activated splenocytes or lymphocytes. While the resulting antibodies may be harvested from the serum of the animal to provide polyclonal preparations it is often desirable to isolate individual lymphocytes from the spleen lymph nodes or peripheral blood to provide homogenous preparations of monoclonal antibodies MAbs . Preferably the lymphocytes are obtained from the spleen.

In this well known process Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 the relatively short lived or mortal lymphocytes from a mammal which has been injected with antigen are fused with an immortal tumor cell line e.g. a myeloma cell line thus producing hybrid cells or hybridomas which are both immortal and capable of producing the genetically coded antibody of the B cell. The resulting hybrids are segregated into single genetic strains by selection dilution and regrowth with each individual strain comprising specific genes for the formation of a single antibody. They produce antibodies which are homogeneous against a desired antigen and in reference to their pure genetic parentage are termed monoclonal. 

Hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that reagents cell lines and media for the formation selection and growth of hybridomas are commercially available from a number of sources and standardized protocols are well established. Generally culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies against the desired antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of the monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro assay such as a radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA . After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . It will further be appreciated that the monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be separated from culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional purification procedures such as for example protein A hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

In another embodiment DNA encoding a desired monoclonal antibodies may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The isolated and subcloned hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulins. More particularly the isolated DNA which may be modified as described herein may be used to clone constant and variable region sequences for the manufacture antibodies as described in Newman et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 658 570 filed Jan. 25 1995 which is incorporated by reference herein. Essentially this entails extraction of RNA from the selected cells conversion to cDNA and amplification by PCR using Ig specific primers. Suitable primers for this purpose are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 658 570. As will be discussed in more detail below transformed cells expressing the desired antibody may be grown up in relatively large quantities to provide clinical and commercial supplies of the immunoglobulin.

Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that DNA encoding antibodies or antibody fragments may also be derived from antibody phage libraries e.g. using pd phage or Fd phagemid technology. Exemplary methods are set forth for example in EP 368 684 B1 U.S. Pat. No. 5 969 108 Hoogenboom H. R. and Chames. 200021 371 Nagy et al. 20028 801 Huie et al. 200198 2682 Lui et al. 2002 315 1063 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Several publications e.g. Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 have described the production of high affinity human antibodies by chain shuffling as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing large phage libraries. In another embodiment Ribosomal display can be used to replace bacteriophage as the display platform see e.g. Hanes et al. 200018 1287 Wilson et al. 200198 3750 or Irving et al. 2001 248 31. In yet another embodiment cell surface libraries can be screened for antibodies Boder et al. 200097 10701 Daugherty et al. 2000 243 211. Such procedures provide alternatives to traditional hybridoma techniques for the isolation and subsequent cloning of monoclonal antibodies.

Yet other embodiments of the present invention comprise the generation of human or substantially human antibodies in transgenic animals e.g. mice that are incapable of endogenous immunoglobulin production see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 075 181 5 939 598 5 591 669 and 5 589 369 each of which is incorporated herein by reference . For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of a human immunoglobulin gene array to such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. Another preferred means of generating human antibodies using SCID mice is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 811 524 which is incorporated herein by reference. It will be appreciated that the genetic material associated with these human antibodies may also be isolated and manipulated as described herein.

Yet another highly efficient means for generating recombinant antibodies is disclosed by Newman 10 1455 1460 1992 . Specifically this technique results in the generation of primatized antibodies that contain monkey variable domains and human constant sequences. This reference is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. Moreover this technique is also described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 658 570 5 693 780 and 5 756 096 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

In another embodiment lymphocytes can be selected by micromanipulation and the variable genes isolated. For example peripheral blood mononuclear cells can be isolated from an immunized mammal and cultured for about 7 days in vitro. The cultures can be screened for specific IgGs that meet the screening criteria. Cells from positive wells can be isolated. Individual Ig producing B cells can be isolated by FACS or by identifying them in a complement mediated hemolytic plaque assay. Ig producing B cells can be micromanipulated into a tube and the Vh and Vl genes can be amplified using e.g. RT PCR. The VH and VL genes can be cloned into an antibody expression vector and transfected into cells e.g. eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells for expression.

Moreover genetic sequences useful for producing the polypeptides of the present invention may be obtained from a number of different sources. For example as discussed extensively above a variety of human antibody genes are available in the form of publicly accessible deposits. Many sequences of antibodies and antibody encoding genes have been published and suitable antibody genes can be chemically synthesized from these sequences using art recognized techniques. Oligonucleotide synthesis techniques compatible with this aspect of the invention are well known to the skilled artisan and may be carried out using any of several commercially available automated synthesizers. In addition DNA sequences encoding several types of heavy and light chains set forth herein can be obtained through the services of commercial DNA synthesis vendors. The genetic material obtained using any of the foregoing methods may then be altered or modified to provide obtain polypeptides of the present invention.

Alternatively antibody producing cell lines may be selected and cultured using techniques well known to the skilled artisan. Such techniques are described in a variety of laboratory manuals and primary publications. In this respect techniques suitable for use in the invention as described below are described in Coligan et al. Eds. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience John Wiley and Sons New York 1991 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety including supplements.

It will further be appreciated that the scope of this invention further encompasses all alleles variants and mutations of antigen binding DNA sequences.

As is well known RNA may be isolated from the original hybridoma cells or from other transformed cells by standard techniques such as guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and precipitation followed by centrifugation or chromatography. Where desirable mRNA may be isolated from total RNA by standard techniques such as chromatography on oligo dT cellulose. Suitable techniques are familiar in the art.

Variable and constant region domains can be obtained from any source and be incorporated into a modified antibody of the invention. To clone antibodies mRNA can be isolated from hybridoma spleen or lymph cells reverse transcribed into DNA and antibody genes amplified by PCR. PCR may be initiated by consensus constant region primers or by more specific primers based on the published heavy and light chain DNA and amino acid sequences. As discussed above PCR also may be used to isolate DNA clones encoding the antibody light and heavy chains. In this case the libraries may be screened by consensus primers or larger homologous probes such as mouse constant region probes. Numerous primer sets suitable for amplification of antibody genes are known in the art e.g. 5 primers based on the N terminal sequence of purified antibodies Benhar and Pastan. 1994. Protein Engineering 7 1509 rapid amplification of cDNA ends Ruberti F. et al. 1994. J. Immunol. Methods 173 33 antibody leader sequences Larrick et al. 1989 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 160 1250 or based on known variable region framework amino acid sequences from the Kabat Kabat et al. 1991. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. Bethesda Md. JS Dep. Health Hum. Serv. 5ed. or the V base databases e.g. Orlandi et al. 1989. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 3833 Sblattero et al. 1998. Immunotechnology 3 271 or Krebber et al. 1997. J. Immunol. Methods 201 35 . Constant region domains can be selected having a particular effector function or lacking a particular effector function or with a particular modification to reduce immunogenicity. Variable and constant domains can be cloned e.g. using the polymerase chain reaction and primers which are selected to amplify the domain of interest. PCR amplification methods are described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 683 195 4 683 202 4 800 159 4 965 188 and in e.g. PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications Innis et al. eds. Academic Press San Diego Calif. 1990 Ho et al. 1989. Gene 77 51 Horton et al. 1993. Methods Enzymol. 217 270 .

Alternatively V domains can be obtained from libraries of V gene sequences from an animal of choice. Libraries expressing random combinations of domains e.g. VH and VL domains can be screened with a desired antigen to identify elements which have desired binding characteristics. Methods of such screening are well known in the art. For example antibody gene repertoires can be cloned into a bacteriophage expression vector Huse W D et al. 1989. Science 2476 1275 . In addition cells Boder and Wittrup. 1997. Nat. Biotechnol. 15 553 Daugtherty P. et al. 2000. J. Immunol. Methods. 243 211 Francisco et al. 1994. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 10444 Georgiou et al. 1997. Nature Biotechnology 15 29 or viruses e.g. Hoogenboom HR. 1998 Immunotechnology 4 1 Winter et al. 1994. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12 433 Griffiths A D. 1998. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 9 102 expressing antibodies on their surface can be screened. Ribosomal display can also be used to screen antibody libraries Hanes J. et al. 1998. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 14130 Hanes J. and Pluckthun. 1999. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 243 107 He M. and Taussig. 1997. Nucleic Acids Research 25 5132 .

Preferred libraries for screening are human V gene libraries. VL and VH domains from a non human source may also be used. In one embodiment such non human V domains can be altered to reduce their immunogenicity using art recognized techniques.

Libraries can be na ve from immunized subjects or semi synthetic Hoogenboom H. R. and Winter. 1992. J. Mol. Biol. 227 381 Griffiths A D et al. EMBO J. 13 3245 de Kruif J. et al. 1995. J. Mol. Biol. 248 97 Barbas C. F. et al. 1992. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 4457 .

In addition the sequences of many antibody V and C domains are known and such domains can be synthesized using methods well known in the art.

In one embodiment mutations can be made to immunoglobulin domains to create a library of nucleic acid molecules having greater heterogeneity Thompson J. et al. 1996. J. Mol. Biol. 256 77 Lamminmaki U. et al. 1999. J. Mol. Biol. 291 589 Caldwell R. C. and Joyce G F. 1992. PCR Methods Appl. 2 28 Caldwell R C and Joyce G F. 1994. PCR Methods Appl. 3 S136. Standard screening procedures can be used to select high affinity variants. In another embodiment changes to VH and VL sequences can be made to increase antibody avidity e.g. using information obtained from crystal structures using techniques known in the art.

Exemplary antibodies or fragments thereof for use in the binding molecules of the invention include antibodies that recognize the targets listed above under subheading A.

Exemplary constructs include e.g. minibodies diabodies diabodies fused to CH3 molecules tetravalent antibodies intradiabodies e.g. Jendreyko et al. 2003. J. Biol. Chem. 278 47813 bispecific antibodies fusion proteins e.g. antibody cytokine fusion proteins proteins fused to at least a portion of an Fc receptor bispecific antibodies. Other immunoglobulins Ig and certain variants thereof are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 745 055 EP 256 654 Faulkner et al. Nature 298 286 1982 EP 120 694 EP 125 023 Morrison J. Immun. 123 793 1979 Kohler et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 2197 1980 Raso et al. Cancer Res. 41 2073 1981 Morrison et al. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2 239 1984 Morrison Science 229 1202 1985 Morrison et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 6851 1984 EP 255 694 EP 266 663 and WO 88 03559. Reassorted immunoglobulin chains also are known. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 444 878 WO 88 03565 and EP 68 763 and references cited therein.

In one embodiment a polypeptide of the invention comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain having deletion or substitution of at least one amino acid. For example the mutation of one or more single amino acid in selected areas of the CH2 domain may be enough to substantially reduce Fc binding and thereby increase tumor localization. Similarly it may be desirable to simply delete that part of one or more constant region domains that control the effector function e.g. complement binding to be modulated. Such partial deletions of the constant regions may improve selected characteristics of the antibody serum half life while leaving other desirable functions associated with the subject constant region domain intact. Accordingly in one embodiment a binding molecule of the invention lacks all or part of a CH2 domain. Moreover as alluded to above the constant regions of the disclosed antibodies may be modified through the mutation or substitution of one or more amino acids that enhances the profile of the resulting construct. In this respect it may be possible to disrupt the activity provided by a conserved binding site e.g. Fc binding while substantially maintaining the configuration and immunogenic profile of the modified antibody. Yet other preferred embodiments may comprise the addition of one or more amino acids to the constant region to enhance desirable characteristics such as effector function or provide for more cytotoxin or carbohydrate attachment. In such embodiments it may be desirable to insert or replicate specific sequences derived from selected constant region domains.

In another embodiment mutations to naturally occurring hinge regions can be made. Such modifications to the constant region in accordance with the instant invention may easily be made using well known biochemical or molecular engineering techniques well within the skill of the art.

In one embodiment polypeptides of the invention comprise modified constant regions wherein one or more domains are partially or entirely deleted domain deleted antibodies . In especially preferred embodiments compatible modified antibodies will comprise domain deleted constructs or variants wherein the entire CH2 domain has been removed. A variety of modified antibody constructs are described in more detail below.

In one embodiment the modified antibodies of the invention are minibodies. Minibodies are dimeric molecules made up of two polypeptide chains each comprising an ScFv molecule a single polypeptide comprising one or more antigen binding sites e.g. a VL domain linked by a flexible linker to a VH domain fused to a CH3 domain via a connecting peptide.

The flexible hinge that links the VL and VH domains that make up the antigen binding site preferably comprises from about 10 to about 50 amino acid residues. An exemplary connecting peptide for this purpose is Gly4Ser 3 SEQ ID NO 17 Huston et al. 1988. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 5879 . Other connecting peptides are known in the art.

Methods of making single chain antibodies are well known in the art e.g. Ho et al. 1989. Gene 77 51 Bird et al. 1988 242 423 Pantoliano et al. 199130 10117 Milenic et al. 199151 6363 Takkinen et al. 19914 837.

Minibodies can be made by constructing an ScFv component and connecting peptide CH3 component using methods described in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 837 821 or WO 94 09817A1 . These components can be isolated from separate plasmids as restriction fragments and then ligated and recloned into an appropriate vector. Appropriate assembly can be verified by restriction digestion and DNA sequence analysis.

In one embodiment a minibody of the invention comprises a connecting peptide. In one embodiment the connecting peptide comprises a gly ser linker e.g. GGGSSGGGSGG SEQ ID NO 38 .

In another embodiment a tetravalent minibody can be constructed. Tetravalent minibodies can be constructed in the same manner as minibodies except that two ScFv molecules are linked using a flexible linker e.g. having an amino acid sequence G4S G3AS SEQ. ID NO 18 .

In another embodiment the modified antibodies of the invention are CH2 domain deleted antibodies. Domain deleted constructs can be derived from a vector e.g. from IDEC Pharmaceuticals San Diego encoding an IgGhuman constant domain see e.g. WO 02 060955A2 and WO02 096948A2 . Essentially the vector was engineered to delete the CH2 domain and provide a modified vector expressing a domain deleted IgGconstant region. Genes encoding the murine variable region of the C2B8 antibody 5E8 antibody B3F6 antibody or the variable region of the humanized CC49 antibody were then inserted in the modified vector and cloned. When expressed in transformed cells these vectors provided C2B8. CH2 5E8. CH2 B3F6. CH2 or huCC49. CH2 or respectively. These constructs exhibit a number of properties that make them particularly attractive candidates for monomeric subunits.

Besides the deletion of whole constant region domains it will be appreciated that the antibodies of the present invention can be engineered to partially delete or substitute of a few amino acids or even a single amino acid. For example the mutation of a single amino acid in selected areas of the C2 domain may be enough to substantially reduce Fc binding and thereby increase tumor localization. Similarly it may be desirable to simply delete that part of one or more constant region domains that control the effector function e.g. complement C1Q binding . Such partial deletions of the constant regions may improve selected characteristics of the antibody serum half life while leaving other desirable functions associated with the subject constant region domain intact. Creation of a C2 domain deleted version can be accomplished by way of overlapping PCR mutagenesis. The gamma 1 constant domain begins with a plasmid encoded Nhe I site with is in translational reading frame with the immunoglobulin sequence. A 5 PCR primer was constructed encoding the Nhe I site as well as sequence immediately downstream. A 3 PCR primer mate was constructed such that it anneals with the 3 end to the immunoglobulin hinge region and encodes in frame the first several amino acids of the gamma 1 CH3 domain. A second PCR primer pair consisted of the reverse complement of the 3 PCR primer from the first pair above as the 5 primer and a 3 primer that anneals at a loci spanning the BsrG I restriction site within the C3 domain. Following each PCR amplification the resultant products were utilized as template with the Nhe I and BsrG I 5 and 3 respectively primers. The amplified product was then cloned back into N5KG1 to create the plasmid N5KG1 C2. This construction places the intact CH3 domain immediately downstream and in frame with the intact hinge region. A similar procedure can be used to create a domain deleted construct in which the CH3 domain is immediately downstream of a connecting peptide. For example a domain deleted version of the C2B8 antibody was created in this manner as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 648 267 and 5 736 137 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment tetravalent domain deleted antibodies can be produced by combining a DNA sequence encoding a domain deleted antibody with a ScFv molecule. For example in one embodiment these sequences are combined such that the ScFv molecule is linked at its N terminus to the CH3 domain of the domain deleted antibody via a flexible linker e.g. a gly ser linker such as Gly4Ser SEQ ID NO 17 .

In another embodiment a tetravalent antibody can be made by fusing an ScFv molecule to a connecting peptide which is fused to a CH1 domain to construct an ScFv Fab tetravalent molecule. Coloma and Morrison. 1997. Nature Biotechnology. 15 159 WO 95 09917 .

Diabodies are similar to scFv molecules but usually have a short less than 10 and preferably 1 5 amino acid residue linker connecting both V domains such that the VL and VH domains on the same polypeptide chain can not interact. Instead the VL and VH domain of one polypeptide chain interact with the VH and VL domain respectively on a second polypeptide chain WO 02 02781 . In one embodiment a binding molecule of the invention is a diabody fused to at least one heavy chain portion. In a preferred embodiment a binding molecule of the invention is a diabody fused to a CH3 domain.

In one embodiment a modified antibody of the invention a binding molecule comprises a tetravalent or bispecific tetravalent CH2 domain deleted antibody with a scFv appended to the N terminus of the light chain. In another embodiment of the invention a binding molecule comprises a tetravalent or bispecific tetravalent CH2 domain deleted antibody with a scFv appended to the N terminus of the heavy chain. In one embodiment the attachment of the scFv to the N terminus results in reduced aggregation of the molecules as compared to molecules in which the scFv is attached at the carboxy terminus. In one embodiment less than about 30 aggregates are present in a composition of binding molecules produced by cells expressing a N terminal fusion construct. In one embodiment less than about 20 aggregates are present in a composition of binding molecules produced by cells expressing a N terminal fusion construct. In one embodiment less than about 10 aggregates are present in a composition of binding molecules produced by cells expressing a N terminal fusion construct. In one embodiment less than about 5 aggregates are present in a composition of binding molecules produced by cells expressing a N terminal fusion construct.

Other forms of modified antibodies are also within the scope of the instant invention e.g. WO 02 02781 A1 5 959 083 6 476 198 B1 US 2002 0103345 A1 WO 00 06605 Byrn et al. 1990. Nature. 344 667 70 Chamow and Ashkenazi. 1996. Trends Biotechnol. 14 52 .

In one embodiment at least one binding specificity of a modified antibody molecule of the invention is catalytic. Catalytic binding specificities can be made using art recognized techniques see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 590 080 U.S. Pat. No. 5 658 753 . Catalytic binding specificities can work by a number of basic mechanisms similar to those identified for enzymes to stabilize the transition state thereby reducing the free energy of activation. For example general acid and base residues can be optimally positioned for participation in catalysis within catalytic active sites covalent enzyme substrate intermediates can be formed catalytic antibodies can also be in proper orientation for reaction and increase the effective concentration of reactants by at least seven orders of magnitude Fersht A. R. et al. Am. Chem. Soc. 90 1968 5833 and thereby greatly reduce the entropy of a chemical reaction. Finally catalytic antibodies can convert the energy obtained upon substrate binding to distort the reaction towards a structure resembling the transition state.

In one embodiment acid or base residues can be brought into the binding site by using a complementary charged molecule as an immunogen. This technique proved successful for elicitation of antibodies with a hapten containing a positively charged ammonium ion Shokat et al. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 27 1988 269 271 .

In another approach antibodies can be elicited to stable compounds that resemble the size shape and charge of the transition state of a desired reaction i.e. transition state analogs . See U.S. Pat. No. 4 792 446 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 963 355 which describe the use of transition state analogues to immunize animals and the production of catalytic antibodies. Both of these patents are hereby incorporated by reference. In one embodiment such molecules can be administered as part of an immunoconjugate e.g. with an immunogenic carrier molecule such as KLH.

Exemplary catalytic binding specificities can have e.g. esterase activity involving a charged transition state whose electrostatic and shape characteristics can be mimicked by a phosphonate structure Jacobs et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109 1987 2174 2176 Durfor et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 1988 8713 8714 Tramontano et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 1988 2282 Pollack et al. J. Am. Chem.

USA 85 1988 5355 5358 Janda et al. Science 241 1988 1188 1191 .

Methods of screening for catalytic antibody activity are well known in the art e.g. Reymond J. L. 2002. Journal of Immunological Methods 269 125 Mouratou et al. 2002. J. of Immunological Methods. 269 147. In yet another embodiment catalytic B cells can be selected e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 590 080 using a molecule can be constructed which facilitates selection of catalytic B cells.

In another embodiment catalytic binding specificities can be developed as part of a two step process. Catalytic antibodies can be selected only if displaying the following binding features binding both the substrate and a reactive group in such a way that the two groups are in a reactive position towards each other. Second the selected antibodies can be chemically engineered by covalently binding a reactive group into the binding pocket of the antibody. J Immunol Methods. 2002. 269 81 98.

In one embodiment a catalytic binding specificity is specific for a prodrug. Such a binding specificity can be used to catalyze the conversion of a prodrug into a drug which is effective in vivo. Preferably the reaction catalyzed is one that cannot be accomplished by natural enzymes in vivo. Examples of prodrug activation by antibodies are known in the art see e.g. Miyashita et al. 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 5337 .

In one embodiment a modified antibody molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding specificity for a target cell and at least one binding specificity for a prodrug. For example in a preferred embodiment an modified antibody molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding specificity for a tumor cell and at least one binding specificity for a prodrug which can be converted to cytotoxic drug. In one example a modified antibody of the invention comprises a binding specificity for a carbamate prodrug 4 N N bis 2 chloroethyl aminophenyl N 1S 1 3 dicarboxy propyl carbamate and generates the corresponding cytotoxic nitrogen mustard Wentworth et al. 1996. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 93 799 .

In one embodiment the modified antibody is administered prior to administration of the prodrug to allow accumulation at the site of the target cell. Exemplary prodrugs are known in the art. Prodrugs can also be synthesized by incorporating a portion designed to be released by catalytic action e.g. by sequential retro aldol retro Michael reactions catalyzed by an antibody with aldolase activity. Shabat et al. 2001. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98 7428 . Such drug masking portions can be made e.g. by modification of hydroxyl or thiol groups of drugs.

In one embodiment a binding molecule of the invention is multispecific i.e. has at least one binding site that binds to a first target molecule or epitope of the target molecule and at least one second binding site that binds to a second different target molecule or to a second different epitope of the first target molecule.

In one embodiment a binding molecule of the invention is bispecific. Bispecific molecules can bind to two different target sites e.g. on the same target molecule or on different target molecules. For example in the case of antibodies bispecific molecules can bind to two different epitopes e.g. on the same antigen or on two different antigens. Bispecific molecules can be used e.g. in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. For example they can be used to immobilize enzymes for use in immunoassays. They can also be used in diagnosis and treatment of cancer e.g. by binding both to a tumor associated molecule and a detectable marker e.g. a chelator which tightly binds a radionuclide. Bispecific molecules can also be used for human therapy e.g. by directing cytotoxicity to a specific target for example by binding to a pathogen or tumor cell and to a cytotoxic trigger molecule such as the T cell receptor or the Fc receptor. Bispecific antibodies can also be used e.g. as fibrinolytic agents or vaccine adjuvants.

In one embodiment the bispecific binding molecules of the invention include those with at least one arm i.e. binding site directed against a cell surface molecule and at least one arm directed against a soluble molecule. In another embodiment a bispecific antibody of the invention has two binding sights that bind to soluble molecules. In another embodiment a bispecific antibody of the invention has two binding sites that bind to cel surface molecules.

Exemplary cell surface molecules include receptors or tumor cell antigens that are overexpressed on the surface of a tumor or neoplastic cell. Exemplary soluble molecules include anti tumor agents e.g. toxins chemotherapeutics and prodrugs thereof and soluble enzymes e.g. prodrug converting enzymes .

Bispecific molecules which bind to both tumor cell antigens and anti tumor agents or soluble enzymes can therefore localize the anti cancer agent to a tumor cell expressing said tumor cell antigen thereby maximizing the toxic effects of the anti cancer agent on a tumor cell and minimizing a toxic effect of the anti cancer agent on normal cells.

Exemplary bispecific binding molecules with at least one binding site for a tumor antigen and at least one binding site for a toxin include anti saporin anti Id 1 anti CD22 anti saporin anti CD7 anti saporin anti CD38 anti saporin anti CEA anti ricin A chain anti interferon .alpha.

Exemplary bispecific binding molecules with at least one binding site for a cell surface molecule and at least one binding site for a prodrug converting enzyme include for example anti CD30 anti alkaline phosphatase which catalyzes conversion of mitomycin phosphate prodrug to the chemotherapeutic mitomycin alcohol .

In other embodiments the bispecific binding molecules bind to both tumor cell antigens and diagnostic agents thereby localizing said diagnostic agent to a tumor cell expressing said tumor cell antigen and facilitating tumor detection in vitro or in vivo. Exemplary bispecific binding molecules include anti CEA anti EOTUBE anti CEA anti DPTA anti CEA anti .beta. galactosidase and anti p185HER2 anti hapten .

In other embodiments bispecific binding molecules of the invention bind to both soluble molecules e.g. soluble antigens and cell surface molecules on non tumor cells e.g. immune cells . For example can be used to target soluble immune complexes to cell surface receptors on immune cells thereby facilitating their clearance from the body by cell mediated immune mechanisms. Exemplary bispecific molecules of this type include anti low density lipoprotein LDL anti Fc receptor e.g. Fc.gamma.RI Fc.gamma.RII or Fc.gamma.RIII and bispecific binding molecules for use in therapy of infectious diseases such as anti CD3 anti herpes simplex virus HSV anti T cell receptor CD3 complex anti influenza anti Fc.gamma.R anti HIV.

In other embodiments bispecific binding molecules of the invention are capable of binding to both cell surface receptors and soluble ligands thereof. In one embodiment the ligand is the cognate ligand of a TNF family receptor.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001. 98 7443 Lu et al. 2004. J. Biol. Chem. 279 2856 .

In other embodiments the bispecific binding molecules of the invention include those with at least one arm i.e. binding site directed against a first soluble molecule e.g. soluble ligand and at least one arm directed against a second soluble molecule e.g. soluble ligand . Such bispecific binding molecules can be employed as diagnostic tools e.g. anti rabbit IgG anti ferritin anti horse radish peroxidase HRP anti hormone anti somatostatin anti substance P anti HRP anti FITC see Nolan et al. supra or fibrinolytic agents e.g. anti fibrin anti tissue plasminogen activator tPA anti fibrin anti urokinase type plasminogen activator uPA .

In a preferred embodiment the soluble molecule to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds is a soluble ligand of the TNF family. Examples of TNF family ligands include but are not limited to LTA which binds TNFR1 TNFRSF1A TNF which binds CD120b TNFRSF1B LTB which binds LTBR TNFRSF3 OX40L which binds OX40 TNFRSF4 CD40L which binds CD40 TNFRSF5 which binds Fas TNFRSF6 and DcR3 TNFRSF6B CD27L which binds CD27 TNFRSF7 CD30L which binds CD30 TNFRSF8 4 1 BB L which binds 4 1 BB TNFRSF9 TRAIL which binds TRAIL R1 TNFRSF10A TRAIL R2 TNFRSF10B TRAIL R3 TNFRSF10C and TRAIL R4 TNFRSF10D RANKL which binds RANK TNFRSF11A and Osteoprotegrin TNFRSF11B APO 3L which binds APO 3 TNFRSF12 and DR3L TNFRSF12L APRIL which binds TACI TNFRSF13B BAFF which binds BAFFR TNFRSF13A LIGHT which binds HVEM TNFRSF14 NGF ligands which bind LNGFR e.g. NGF NGF 2 NTF3 NTF5 BDNF IFRD1 GITRL which binds GITR TNFRSF18 EDAR1 XEDAR ligand Fn14 ligand and Troy Trade ligand.

In other exemplary embodiments the bispecific binding molecules of the invention have at least one binding site for a first cell surface molecule and at least one binding site for a second cell surface molecule. In one embodiment the first and second cell surface molecules are located on different cells e.g. different cell types . For example bispecific molecules may have at least one arm directed against a tumor cell antigen and at least one arm directed against cell surface receptor on a non tumor cell e.g. an immune cell . Exemplary bispecific binding molecules of this type include those having at least one binding site for a tumor cell antigen and at least one binding site directed against a cytotoxic trigger molecule of an immune effector cell such as anti Fc.gamma.RI anti CD15 anti p185.sup.HER2 Fc.gamma.RIII CD16 anti p185.sup.HER2 anti VEGF anti CD3 anti malignant B cell 1D10 anti CD3 anti p185.sup.HER2 anti CD3 anti p97 anti CD3 anti renal cell carcinoma anti CD3 anti OVCAR 3 anti CD3 L D1 anti colon carcinoma anti CD3 anti melanocyte stimulating hormone analog anti EGF receptor anti CD3 anti CD3 anti CAMA1 anti CD3 anti CD19 anti CD3 MoV18 anti neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM anti CD3 anti folate binding protein FBP anti CD3 and anti pan carcinoma associated antigen AMOC 31 anti CD3 . Bispecific molecules which bind to both tumor cell antigens and cytotoxic trigger molecule are capable of effectively juxtaposing a tumor cell with an immune effector cell thereby activating the effector cell to destroy the tumor cell by cell mediated immune mechanisms.

In another embodiment the first and second cell surface molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule is capable of binding are located on the same cell or cell type. By crosslinking the first and second receptors on the same cell the bispecific binding molecules of the invention may inhibit or enhance an activity e.g. signal transduction activity associated with one or both of the first and second receptors. In one embodiment the first and second cell surface molecules are of the same type e.g. are in the same family of molecules . In another embodiment said first and second cell surface molecules are distinct types e.g. are in different families of molecules . Exemplary cell surface receptors to which the bispecific binding molecules bind include tumor cell antigens or immune cell receptors. Exemplary cell surface receptors include any of the cytokine receptors adhesion molecules or growth factor receptors described in section A supra.

In one embodiment exemplary target molecules to which a binding molecule of the invention binds include one or more epitopes of e.g. heparin sulfate growth factors or their receptors e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor insulin like growth factor receptor hepatocyte growth factor HGF SF receptor See e.g. Cao et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001. 98 7443 Lu et al. 2004. J. Biol. Chem. 279 2856 .

In an exemplary embodiment at least one of the molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds is a member of the TNF receptor TNFR family. In another exemplary embodiment the first and second target molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds are both TNFR family members. In another embodiment a binding molecule of the invention binds to a TNFR family ligand. In yet another embodiment a binding molecule of the invention binds to one TNFR family member and an antigen expressed on the surface of a tumor cell e.g. preferentially expressed on a tumor cell. The limiting factor in the treatment of tumors with monospecific TNFR binding molecules is that often only a subset of tumors appears to be sensitive to such therapies. Bispecific TNFR binding molecules can specifically activate TNFRs and enhance receptor signaling by for example bringing the TNFRs into close proximity. The invention provides improved bispecific TNFR binding molecules which can target more than one TNFR or TNFR type and enhance signaling thus providing an improved method of treating cancer. In one embodiment the bispecific TNFR binding molecule increases the signal strength by binding to two or more TNFRs of the same type increasing the number of TNFRs being brought together. In another more preferred embodiment the bispecific TNFR binding molecule is capable of binding to two different receptors of the TNF family.

In one embodiment at least one of the TNFRs to which a bispecific TNFR binding molecule binds contains a death domain. The term death domain refers to a cytoplasmic region of a TNF family receptor which is involved TNF mediated cell death or apoptotic signaling and cell cytotoxicity induction mediated by these receptors. This region couples the receptor to caspase activation via adaptor proteins resulting in activation of the extrinsic death pathway.

Examples of TNF receptors which contain death domains include but are not limited to TNFR1 TNFRSF1A Fas TNFRSF6 DR 3 TNFRSF6B LNGFR TNFRSF16 TRAIL R1 TNFRSF10A TRAIL R2 TNFRSF10B and DR6 TNFRSF21 . The apoptotic signaling of these receptors is modulated upon binding of a cognate ligand and formation of any of the following receptor ligand pairs TNFR1 TNF Fas FasL DR 3 DR 3LG TRAIL R1 TRAIL or TRAIL R2 TRAIL.

Bispecific TNFR binding molecules that target TNF family receptors containing death domains are useful for the treatment of cancer since the TNFRs of this type are often overexpressed on tumor cells and stimulating of the receptor can activate tumor cell apoptosis. In preferred embodiments the death domain containing TNFR to which the bispecific TNFR binding molecule of the invention binds is TRAIL R2. TRAIL R2 is preferred for human tumor therapy since its activation does not trigger hepatocyte apoptosis and hence should have reduced toxicity.

While the activation of some of death domain containing receptors e.g. TNFR1 or Fas has been toxic in in vivo applications it is likely that tethering these receptors to other TNF receptors may diminish toxicity and thus render a toxic antibody less toxic.

In one embodiment a bispecific TNFR binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding site directed to a TNFR containing a death domain and at least one binding site directed to a TNFR lacking a death domain.

In certain exemplary embodiments TNFRs lacking a death domain include TNFRs involved in tissue differentiation. Examples of TNFR receptors involved in tissue differentiation include LT R RANK EDAR1 XEDAR Fn14 Troy Trade and NGFR. TNFRs involved in tissue differentiation may influence tissue differentiation following binding of a cognate ligand. TNFR binding molecules that target TNFRs involved in tissue differentiation can affect tumors in several ways. First they have the potential to directly slow tumor growth by altering cell cycle progression. Second tissue differentiation in the context of tumor cell transformation may lead to cell cycle conflict and default apoptosis. Third such conflicting input may render a cell more sensitive to chemotherapy.

In certain preferred embodiments TNFR involved in tissue differentiation is lymphotoxin receptor LT R . LT R is involved in the control of the maturation status of various specialized stromal cells in the immune system and plays a critical role during the development of the stromal elements of the lymph node anlagen. It has been proposed that activation of a developmental program in epithelial or fibroblastoid cells in the context of a transformed cell is detrimental to their survival and this action may account for some of the anti tumor activity of LT R activation. These receptors can also initiate inflammatory programs that involve chemokine release or promote immunological anti tumor responses. Such release could affect the inflammatory status of the tumor and or invoke infiltration of lymphoid elements promoting an immunological reaction to the tumor. Thus bispecific TNFR binding molecules which bind LT R alone or in combination with TNF receptors containing death domains e.g. TRAIL R2 are encompassed by the invention.

In certain exemplary embodiments the TNFRs lacking a death domain include TNFRs involved in immune regulation. Such receptors include TNFR2 HVEM CD27 CD30 CD40 4 1BB OX40 GITR TACI BAFF R BCMA and RELT. Additional TNF family receptors involved in immune regulation include TRAIL R3 and TRAIL R4.

Other target TNF family receptors with a role in tumor formation can be identified using existing RNA databases of receptor expression in various cell types which allow one to define TNF family receptors that are present or ideally overexpressed on various tumors. Moreover existing RNA databases provide an additional advantage in that the pair of TNF family receptors to which a bispecific TNFR binding molecule of the invention binds could be optimized by identifying those receptor pairs that are more uniquely expressed on a tumor type or subset of tumors but are not abundant on normal tissues especially liver and vasculature. In such a manner receptor pairs or more are identified that could deliver a potent signal to the tumor and spare normal tissues.

The multispecific binding molecules of the invention may be monovalent for each specificity or multivalent for each specificity. In one embodiment a bispecific binding molecule of the invention may comprise one binding site that reacts with a first target molecule and one binding site that reacts with a second target molecule e.g. a bispecific antibody molecule fusion protein or minibody .

An example of a bispecific N scFv tetravalent minibody is shown in . Alternatively the second scFv fragment may be linked to the C terminus of said heavy chain portion containing said first scFv fragment e.g. bispecific C scFv tetravalent minibodies .

Where the scFv fragment and variable region of a first heavy chain portion of a bispecific scFc2 tetravalent antibody bind the same target molecule at least one of the first and second scFv fragments of the second heavy chain portion of the bispecific tetravalent minibody binds a different target molecule.

In another embodiment the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are scFv2 tetravalent domain deleted antibodies with each heavy chain portion of the scFv2 tetravalent antibody containing a scFv fragment. The scFv fragments may be linked to the N termini of a variable region of the heavy chain portions e.g. bispecific NscFv2 tetravalent domain deleted antibodies see or bispecific NscFv2 tetravalent antibodies see . Alternatively the scFv fragments may be linked to the C termini of the heavy chain portions of the scFv2 tetravalent antibody e.g. bispecific C scFv2 tetravalent antibodies see for example .

Methods of producing bispecific molecules are well known in the art. For example recombinant technology can be used to produce bispecific molecules e.g. diabodies single chain diabodies tandem scFvs etc. Exemplary techniques for producing bispecific molecules are known in the art e.g. Kontermann et al. Methods in Molecular Biology Vol. 248 Antibody Engineering Methods and Protocols. Pp 227 242 US 2003 0207346 A1 and the references cited therein . In one embodiment a multimeric bispecific molecules are prepared using methods such as those described e.g. in US 2003 0207346 A1 or U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 333 or US2004 0058400.

In another embodiment a multispecific binding molecule of the invention is a multispecific fusion protein. As used herein the phrase multispecific fusion protein designates fusion proteins as hereinabove defined having at least two binding specificities i.e. combining two or more binding domains of a ligand or receptor . Multispecific fusion proteins can be assembled as heterodimers heterotrimers or heterotetramers essentially as disclosed in WO 89 02922 published Apr. 6 1989 in EP 314 317 published May 3 1989 and in U.S. Pat. No. 5 116 964 issued May 2 1992. Preferred multispecific fusion proteins are bispecific. Examples of bispecific fusion proteins include CD4 IgG TNF receptor IgG and CD4 IgG L selectin IgG. The last mentioned molecule combines the lymph node binding function of the lymphocyte homing receptor LHR L selectin and the HIV binding function of CD4 and finds potential application in the prevention or treatment of HIV infection related conditions or as a diagnostic.

In another embodiment the invention pertains to bispecific binding molecules e.g. antibodies which incorporate at least one binding site that binds to a known target and at least one binding site which recognizes an unknown target for example in one embodiment the bispecific molecule incorporates binding sites selected from a semi synthetic antibody phage display library .

In one embodiment of the invention one of ordinary skill in the art could start with a single chain antibody of known specificity and build a Fab library using techniques known in the art or alternatively the skilled artisan could start with an Fab fragment of known specificity and build a single chain library using techniques known in the art. It is known in the art that libraries from nonimmunized sources and prepared by synthetic recombination of V gene sequences preferably recombination of VH with DH and JH and VL with JL sequences can be used to isolate antibodies to any antigen. For example patent application WO92 01047 teaches that antibody fragments can be displayed on the surface of bacteriophage and that they will bind antigen. Antibody fragments e.g. Fab Fv ScFv and VH can be directly selected using this characteristic. Other methods known in the art include those taught e.g. in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 698 426 6 291 159 5 658 727 5 667 988 and 5 969 108.

In another embodiment scFv which recognize a known target can be dimerized with scFv isolated from a semi synthetic human phage antibody display library. see e.g. Kruif and Logtenberg 1996. J. Biol. Chem. 271 7630 .

In one embodiment the subject bispecific molecule is expressed in any expression system used to express antibody molecules for example mammalian cells yeast such as Picchia Bacculovirus etc. In one embodiment the subject bispecific molecule is expressed in the NEOSPLA vector system see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 159 730 . This vector contains the cytomegalovirus promoter enhancer the mouse beta globin major promoter the SV40 origin of replication the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence neomycin phosphotransferase exon 1 and exon 2 the dihydrofolate reductase gene and leader sequence.

These bispecific molecules have one or more binding sites for a known target and express a library at one or more binding sites. Such bispecific molecules can be used e.g. to identify molecules in close proximity to or associated with the known target. For example the skilled artisan could use the subject bispecific molecules in an assay to select for those that induce a particular response e.g. apoptosis or cellular activation using screening methods well known in the art. The bispecific molecule identified as producing the response screened for can then be identified and its specificity determined. Using such methods it is possible to identify molecules in close association with particular targets of interest e.g. T cell markers or other signaling molecules such as CRIPTO I death domain molecules or molecules involved in apoptosis . The proximity of the known target and the molecule newly identified as a nearest neighbor can be confirmed using immunoprecipitation or other techniques known to those of skill in the art. Using these methods it is possible to identify molecules as targets for modulating a particular cellular response.

Binding specificities comprising antigen recognition sites or entire variable regions of multispecific binding molecule in particular multispecific antibodies or antibody variants of the invention may be derived from one or more parental antibodies. The parental antibodies can include naturally occurring antibodies or antibody fragments antibodies or antibody fragments adapted from naturally occurring antibodies antibodies constructed de novo using sequences of antibodies or antibody fragments known to be specific a target molecule. Sequences that may be derived from parental antibodies include heavy and or light chain variable regions and or CDRs framework regions or other portions thereof.

In one exemplary embodiment of the invention the parental antibodies used to construct a bispecific TNFR binding molecule are an anti TRAIL R2 antibody for example 14A2 and an anti LT R antibody for example CBE11. Multivalent multispecific antibodies may contain a heavy chain comprising two or more variable regions and or a light chain comprising one or more variable regions wherein at least two of the variable regions recognize different epitopes of LT R.

Bispecific TNFR binding molecules may be constructed in a variety different ways using a variety of different sequences derived from parental anti LT R antibodies including murine or humanized BHA10 Browning et al. 154 33 1995 Browning et al. 183 867 1996 murine or humanized CBE11 U.S. Pat.

Following manipulation of the isolated genetic material to provide polypeptides of the invention as set forth above the genes are typically inserted in an expression vector for introduction into host cells that may be used to produce the desired quantity of modified antibody that in turn provides the claimed polypeptides.

The term vector or expression vector is used herein for the purposes of the specification and claims to mean vectors used in accordance with the present invention as a vehicle for introducing into and expressing a desired gene in a cell. As known to those skilled in the art such vectors may easily be selected from the group consisting of plasmids phages viruses and retroviruses. In general vectors compatible with the instant invention will comprise a selection marker appropriate restriction sites to facilitate cloning of the desired gene and the ability to enter and or replicate in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells.

For the purposes of this invention numerous expression vector systems may be employed. For example one class of vector utilizes DNA elements which are derived from animal viruses such as bovine papilloma virus polyoma virus adenovirus vaccinia virus baculovirus retroviruses RSV MMTV or MOMLV or SV40 virus. Others involve the use of polycistronic systems with internal ribosome binding sites. Exemplary vectors include those taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6 159 730 or 6 413 777 or US 2003 0157641 A1 . Additionally cells which have integrated the DNA into their chromosomes may be selected by introducing one or more markers which allow selection of transfected host cells. The marker may provide for prototrophy to an auxotrophic host biocide resistance e.g. antibiotics or resistance to heavy metals such as copper. The selectable marker gene can either be directly linked to the DNA sequences to be expressed or introduced into the same cell by cotransformation.

Additional elements may also be needed for optimal synthesis of mRNA. These elements may include signal sequences splice signals as well as transcriptional promoters enhancers and termination signals.

In one embodiment a secretion signal e.g. any one of several well characterized bacterial leader peptides e.g. pelB phoA or ompA can be fused in frame to the N terminus of a polypeptide of the invention to obtain optimal secretion of the polypeptide. Lei et al. 1988 Nature 331 543 Better et al. Science 1988. 240 1041 Mullinax et al. 1990. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 8095 .

In one embodiment a vector can be used which comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding a peptide linker. In another embodiment it might be desirable to first assemble the desired coding sequences e.g. secretion signal VL linker peptide VH etc. into a single sequence for example by PCR amplification using overlapping primers followed by ligation into a plasmid or other vector.

In particularly preferred embodiments the cloned variable region genes are inserted into an expression vector along with the heavy and light chain constant region genes preferably human modified as discussed above. Preferably this is effected using a proprietary expression vector of IDEC Inc. referred to as NEOSPLA see U.S. Pat. No. 6 159 730. This vector contains the cytomegalovirus promoter enhancer the mouse beta globin major promoter the SV40 origin of replication the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence neomycin phosphotransferase exon 1 and exon 2 the dihydrofolate reductase gene and leader sequence. As seen in the examples below this vector has been found to result in very high level expression of antibodies upon incorporation of variable and constant region genes transfection in CHO cells followed by selection in G418 containing medium and methotrexate amplification. Vector systems are also taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 736 137 and 5 658 570 each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. This system provides for high expression levels e.g. 30 pg cell day. Other exemplary vector systems are disclosed e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6 413 777.

In other preferred embodiments the polypeptides of the invention of the instant invention may be expressed using polycistronic constructs such as those disclosed in U.S. provisional application No. 60 331 481 filed Nov. 16 2001 and incorporated herein in its entirety. In these novel expression systems multiple gene products of interest such as heavy and light chains of antibodies may be produced from a single polycistronic construct. These systems advantageously use an internal ribosome entry site IRES to provide relatively high levels of polypeptides of the invention in eukaryotic host cells. Compatible IRES sequences are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 193 980 which is also incorporated herein. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such expression systems may be used to effectively produce the full range of polypeptides disclosed in the instant application.

More generally once the vector or DNA sequence encoding a monomeric subunit of the polypeptide e.g. a modified antibody has been prepared the expression vector may be introduced into an appropriate host cell. That is the host cells may be transformed. Introduction of the plasmid into the host cell can be accomplished by various techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These include but are not limited to transfection including electrophoresis and electroporation protoplast fusion calcium phosphate precipitation cell fusion with enveloped DNA microinjection and infection with intact virus. See Ridgway A. A. G. Chapter 24.2 pp. 470 472 Vectors Rodriguez and Denhardt Eds. Butterworths Boston Mass. 1988 . Most preferably plasmid introduction into the host is via electroporation. The transformed cells are grown under conditions appropriate to the production of the light chains and heavy chains and assayed for heavy and or light chain protein synthesis. Exemplary assay techniques include enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA radioimmunoassay RIA or flourescence activated cell sorter analysis FACS immunohistochemistry and the like.

As used herein the term transformation shall be used in a broad sense to refer to any introduction of DNA into a recipient host cell that changes the genotype and consequently results in a change in the recipient cell.

Along those same lines host cells refers to cells that have been transformed with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques and encoding at least one heterologous gene. In descriptions of processes for isolation of antibodies from recombinant hosts the terms cell and cell culture are used interchangeably to denote the source of antibody unless it is clearly specified otherwise. In other words recovery of polypeptide from the cells may mean either from spun down whole cells or from the cell culture containing both the medium and the suspended cells.

The host cell line used for protein expression is most preferably of mammalian origin those skilled in the art are credited with ability to preferentially determine particular host cell lines which are best suited for the desired gene product to be expressed therein. Exemplary host cell lines include but are not limited to DG44 and DUXB11 Chinese Hamster Ovary lines DHFR minus HELA human cervical carcinoma CVI monkey kidney line COS a derivative of CVI with SV40 T antigen R1610 Chinese hamster fibroblast BALBC 3T3 mouse fibroblast HAK hamster kidney line SP2 O mouse myeloma P3.times.63 Ag3.653 mouse myeloma BFA 1c1BPT bovine endothelial cells RAJI human lymphocyte and 293 human kidney . CHO cells are particularly preferred. Host cell lines are typically available from commercial services the American Tissue Culture Collection or from published literature.

In another embodiment a host cell is a prokaryotic cell e.g. a strain which allows the formation of disulfide bonds Derman A I et al. 1993. Science. 262 1744 Bessette P H. Et al. 1999. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96 13703 .

In vitro production allows scale up to give large amounts of the desired polypeptides. Techniques for mammalian cell cultivation under tissue culture conditions are known in the art and include homogeneous suspension culture e.g. in an airlift reactor or in a continuous stirrer reactor or immobilized or entrapped cell culture e.g. in hollow fibers microcapsules on agarose microbeads or ceramic cartridges. If necessary and or desired the solutions of polypeptides can be purified by the customary chromatography methods for example gel filtration ion exchange chromatography chromatography over DEAE cellulose or immuno affinity chromatography e.g. after preferential biosynthesis of a modified hinge region polypeptide or prior to or subsequent to the HIC chromatography step described herein.

Genes encoding the polypeptide of the invention can also be expressed non mammalian cells such as bacteria or yeast or plant cells. In this regard it will be appreciated that various unicellular non mammalian microorganisms such as bacteria can also be transformed i.e. those capable of being grown in cultures or fermentation. Bacteria which are susceptible to transformation include members of the enterobacteriaceae such as strains of or Bacillaceae such as and . It will further be appreciated that when expressed in bacteria the polypeptides typically become part of inclusion bodies. The polypeptides must be isolated purified and then assembled into functional molecules. Where tetravalent forms of antibodies are desired the subunits will then self assemble into tetravalent antibodies WO02 096948A2 .

In addition to prokaryates eukaryotic microbes may also be used. or common baker s yeast is the most commonly used among eukaryotic microorganisms although a number of other strains are commonly available. For expression in the plasmid YRp7 for example Stinchcomb et al. Nature 282 39 1979 Kingsman et al. Gene 7 141 1979 Tschemper et al. Gene 10 157 1980 is commonly used. This plasmid already contains the TRP1 gene which provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4 1 Jones Genetics 85 12 1977 . The presence of the trp1 lesion as a characteristic of the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan.

IV. Separation of Polypeptides Comprising at Least One Interchain Disulfide Linkage From Those Lacking Interchain Disulfide Linkages

In one aspect the invention pertains to separation of molecules having two heavy chain portions from a mixture where a fraction of the molecules are present in a form in which the two heavy chain portions are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage and a fraction of the molecules comprise heavy chain portions that are not linked via at least one disulfide linkage by hydrophobic interaction chromatography.

Hydrophobic interaction chromatography was first developed following the observation that proteins could be retained on affinity gels which comprised hydrocarbon spacer arms but lacked the affinity ligand. Elution from HIC supports can be effected by alterations in solvent pH ionic strength or by the addition of chaotropic agents or organic modifiers such as ethylene or propylene glycol. A description of the general principles of hydrophobic interaction chromatography can be found e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 3 917 527 and in U.S. Pat. No. 4 000 098. HIC in the context of high performance liquid chromatography HPLC has been used to separate antibody fragments lacking heavy chain portions e.g. F ab from intact antibody molecules in a single step protocol. Morimoto K. et al. L Biochem. Biophys. Meth. 24 107 1992 .

The separation method of the invention can be performed on an unpurified population of polypeptides e.g. culture supernatants or preparations or preparations of polypeptides isolated from prokaryotic inclusion bodies . Alternatively the instant separation methods can be used on polypeptide mixtures obtained after one or more initial purification steps e.g. after a preparation comprising forms A and B has been eluted from an affinity matrix.

In one embodiment the binding molecules subjected to HIC chromatography comprise a connecting peptide of the invention.

In a preferred embodiment HIC can be applied to mixtures that have been partially purified by other protein purification procedures. The term partially purified as used herein includes a protein preparation in which the protein of interest is present in at least 5 by weight more preferably at least 10 and most preferably at least 45 . Initial or subsequent purification steps can be used to remove e.g. immunoglobulin aggregates misfolded species host cell protein residue material from preceding chromatographic steps such as Protein A when employed . In one embodiment HIC can be performed on polypeptides comprising a connecting peptide of the invention. Accordingly the application of HIC can also be appreciated in the context of an overall purification protocol. Exemplary purification steps that can be used prior to or subsequent to HIC include affinity chromatography for example PROSEP A BioProcessing Ltd. U.K. which consists of Protein A covalently coupled to controlled pore glass or Protein A SEPHAROSE Fast Flow Pharmacia or TOYOPEARL 650M Protein A TosoHaas . Protein A is preferred for human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains and protein G for mouse isotypes. Bakerbond ABXtm resin can be used if the molecule comprises a CH3 domain. In addition or alternatively ion exchange chromatography may be employed. In this regard various anionic or cationic substituents may be attached to matrices in order to form anionic or cationic supports for chromatography. Anionic exchange substituents include diethylaminoethyl DEAE quaternary aminoethyl QAE and quaternary amine Q groups. Cationic exchange substituents include carboxymethyl CM sulfoethyl SE sulfopropyl SP phosphate P and sulfonate S . Cellulose ion exchange resins such as DE23 DE32 DE52 CM 23 CM 32 and CM 52 are available from Whatman Ltd. Maidstone Kent U.K. SEPHADEX based and locross linked ion exchangers are also known. For example DEAE QAE CM and SP SEPHADEX and DEAE Q CM and S SEPHAROSE and SEPHAROSE Fast Flow are all available from Pharmacia AB. Further both DEAE and CM derivitized ethylene glycol methacrylate copolymer such as TOYOPEARL DEAE 650S or M and TOYOPEARL CM 650S or M are available from Toso Haas Co. Philadelphia Pa. Because elution from ion exchange supports usually involves addition of salt and because HIC is enhanced under increased salt concentrations the introduction of a HIC step following an ionic exchange chromatographic step or other salt mediated purification step is preferred. Additional purification protocols may be added including but not necessarily limited to further ionic exchange chromatography size exclusion chromatography viral inactivation concentration and freeze drying hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEQHAROSE chromatofocusing or ammonium sulfate precipitation.

Prior to purification using the subject methods the composition comprising the mixture of polypeptides to be separated will preferably be placed in a buffer of acidic or approximately neutral pH. This can be done for example by adding concentrated buffer resuspending the sample in the buffer exchanging the buffer e.g. using dialysis or ultrafiltration . Alternatively the pH of the sample buffer can simply be adjusted to be within the desired range.

Hydrophobic interactions are strongest at high ionic strength therefore this form of separation is conveniently performed following salt precipitations or ion exchange procedures. Adsorption of the proteins to a HIC column is favored by high salt concentrations but the actual concentrations can vary over a wide range depending on the nature of the protein and the particular HIC ligand chosen. Various ions can be arranged in a so called soluphobic series depending on whether they promote hydrophobic interactions salting out effects or disrupt the structure of water chaotropic effect and lead to the weakening of the hydrophobic interaction. Cations are ranked in terms of increasing salting out effect as Ba

In general Na K or NHsulfates effectively promote ligand protein interaction in HIC. Salts may be formulated that influence the strength of the interaction as given by the following relationship NH SO NaSO NaCl NHCl NaBr NaSCN. In general salt concentrations of between about 0.75 and about 2M ammonium sulfate or between about 1 and 4M NaCl are useful.

A number of chromatographic supports may be employed in the preparation of HIC columns the most extensively used are agarose silica and organic polymer or co polymer resins. The hydrophobic interaction material is generally a base matrix e.g. a hydrophilic carbohydrate such as cross linked agarose or synthetic copolymer material to which hydrophobic ligands e.g. alkyl or aryl groups are coupled. The preferred HIC material comprises an agarose resin substituted with phenyl groups. Exemplary HIC material includes phenyl SEPHAROSE FAST FLOW with low or high substitution Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology AB Sweden phenyl SEPHAROSE High Performance column phenyl or butyl SEPHAROSE CL 4B butyl SEPHAROSE FF octyl SEPHAROSE FF and phenyl SEPHAROSE FF Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology AB Sweden Fractogel EMD Propyl or FRACTOGEL EMC Phenyl columns E. Merck Germany MACROPREP Methyl or MACRO PREP t Butyl Supports Bio Rad California WP HI Propyl C3 column J. T. Baker New Jersey . Exemplary HIC materials are also available from Tosoh Corporation Tokyo Japan under the product names TOYOPEARL ether 650 phenyl 650 butyl 650 Fractogel ether 5PW HR or phenyl 5PW HR Miles Yeda Rehovot Israel under the product name alkyl agarose wherein the alkyl group contains from 2 10 carbon atoms and J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. under the product name Bakerbond WP HI propyl. It is also possible to prepare the desired HIC column using conventional chemistry. Sa for example Er el. Z. gl all Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 49 383 1972 or Ulbrich V. rd gL Coll. Czech. Chem. Commum. 9 1466 1964 .

The choice of a particular gel can be determined by the skilled artisan. In general the strength of the interaction of the protein and the HIC ligand increases with the chain length of the alkyl ligands but ligands having from about 4 to about 8 carbon atoms are suitable for most separations. A phenyl group has about the same hydrophobicity as a pentyl group although the selectivity can be different owing to the possibility of pi pi orbital interaction with aromatic groups on the protein. Selectively may also be affected by the chemistry of the supporting resin.

Ligand density is an important parameter in that it influences not only the strength of the interaction but the capacity of the column as well. The ligand density of the commercially available phenyl or octyl phenyl gels is on the order of 40 pmoles ml gel bed. Gel capacity is a function of the particular protein in question as well as pH temperature and salt type and concentration but generally can be expected to fall in the range of 3 20 mg ml of gel.

In general a decrease in temperature decreases the interaction with HIC material. However any benefit that would accrue by increasing the temperature must also be weighed against adverse effects such an increase may have on the stability of the protein.

In one embodiment the polypeptides of the invention can be eluted isocratically. In isocratic elution all compounds begin migration through the column at onset. However each migrates at a different rate resulting in faster or slower elution rate. For example as described in the instant examples form A can be eluted with the flow through of the column.

In another embodiment one or more polypeptides of the invention can be bound to the column and eluted e.g. using stepwise elution or gradient elution. Elution whether stepwise or in the form of a gradient can be accomplished in a variety of ways a by changing the salt concentration b by changing the polarity of the solvent or c by adding detergents. By decreasing salt concentration adsorbed proteins are eluted in order of increasing hydrophobicity. Changes in polarity may be affected by additions of solvents such as ethylene or propylene glycol or iso propanol thereby decreasing the strength of the hydrophobic interactions. Detergents function as displacers of proteins and have been used primarily in connection with the purification of membrane proteins

In performing the separation the polypeptide mixture can be contacted with the HIC material e.g. using a batch purification technique or using a column. Prior to HIC purification it may be desirable to remove any chaotropic agents or very hydrophobic substances e.g. by passing the mixture through a precolumn.

For example for batch purification HIC material is prepared in or equilibrated to the desired starting buffer. A slurry of the HIC material is obtained. The polypeptide solution is contacted with the slurry to adsorb at least one of the polypeptides to be separated to the HIC material. The solution containing the polypeptides that do not bind to the HIC material is separated from the slurry e.g. by allowing the slurry to settle and removing the supernatant. The slurry can be subjected to one or more washing steps. If desired the slurry can be contacted with a solution of lower conductivity to desorb polypeptides that have bound to the HIC material. In order to elute bound polypeptides the salt concentration can be decreased.

In one embodiment the HIC material can be packed in a column. A mixture comprising the polypeptides to be separated can be applied to the column allowing at least one of the polypeptides to be separated to adsorb to the column. The polypeptides that do not adsorb to the column pass through and can be collected. In order to elute bound polypeptides the salt concentration can be decreased e.g. in a step wise fashion or using a salt gradient.

Since form B is more hydrophobic than form A it adsorbs irreversibly to the stationary phase using approximately 0.7 M e.g. 0.73M Ammonium Sulfate 20 mM Sodium Phosphate pH 4.0 to pH 8.0 as the mobile phase. Form A binds to a lesser extent to the stationary phase under these conditions and is therefore eluted isocratically i.e. it leaves the column with the flowthrough fraction. Subsequent to the isocratic elution of form A omitting Ammonium sulfate from the mobile phase desorbs form B.

In an exemplary purification scheme the HIC material is equilibrated in a buffer comprising a salt concentration yielding a conductivity of from between about 160 to about 110 preferably from between about 140 to about 115 even more preferably from between about 130 or about 120 to about 117 mS cm. For example an exemplary starting solution comprises a salt concentration of approximately 1M to 0.7M e.g. 1M to 0.7M ammonium sulfate. In a preferred embodiment the solution comprising the mixture of polypeptides to be separated is also brought to the same or approximately the same conductivity e.g. using a concentrated stock solution of salt . Under these conditions Form A is eluted from the column at a conductivity of about 120 mS cm. In order to elute Form B a stepwise or linear gradient of reducing ammonium sulfate content can be applied to the column. Form B elutes at a conductivity of approximately 115 to approximately 100 mS cm.

In one embodiment the subject purification method yields a composition comprising polypeptide molecules having at least two target binding sites and two heavy chain portions wherein the heavy chain portions lack CH2 domains and wherein greater than about 50 of the molecules are present in a form in which the two heavy chain portions are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage. In another embodiment greater than about 60 of the molecules are present in a form in which the two heavy chain portions are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage. In another embodiment greater than about 70 of the molecules are present in a form in which the two heavy chain portions are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage. In another embodiment greater than about 80 of the molecules are present in a form in which the two heavy chain portions are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage. In another embodiment greater than about 90 of the molecules are present in a form in which the two heavy chain portions are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage.

In one embodiment the subject purification method yields a composition comprising recombinant polypeptide molecules having at least two target binding sites and two heavy chain portions wherein greater than about 99 of the molecules are present in a form in which the two heavy chain portions are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage.

In one embodiment the subject purification method yields a composition comprising polypeptide molecules having at least two target binding sites and two heavy chain portions wherein greater than about 95 of the molecules are present in a form in which the two heavy chain portions are linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage and wherein the heavy chain portions of the polypeptides are derived from an antibody of the IgG4 isotype.

In one embodiment the subject purification method yields a composition comprising polypeptide molecules having two light chain portions and two heavy chain portions wherein the heavy chain portions lack CH2 domains and wherein greater than about 80 of the molecules are present in a form in which the two heavy chain portions are not linked via at least one interchain disulfide linkage.

In another aspect the instant invention also provides methods for monitoring the results of purification and or preferential biosynthesis comprising measuring the relative amounts of Form A and Form B in a composition. Form A and Form B can be measured e.g. as described herein using non reducing SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or mass spectrometry.

The polypeptide molecules of the present invention may be used in non conjugated form or may conjugated to at least one of a variety of molecules e.g. to facilitate antigen detection or for imaging or therapy of the patient. The polypeptides of the invention can be labeled or conjugated either before or after purification when purification is performed. In particular the polypeptides of the present invention may be conjugated to cytotoxins such as radioisotopes cytotoxic drugs or toxins therapeutic agents cytostatic agents biological toxins prodrugs peptides proteins enzymes viruses lipids biological response modifiers pharmaceutical agents immunologically active ligands e.g. lymphokines or antibodies wherein the resulting molecule binds to both the neoplastic cell and an effector cell such as a T cell or PEG. In another embodiment a polypeptide of the invention can be conjugated to a molecule that decreases vascularization of tumors. In other embodiments the disclosed compositions may comprise polypeptides of the invention coupled to drugs or prodrugs. Still other embodiments of the present invention comprise the use of polypeptides of the invention conjugated to specific biotoxins or their cytotoxic fragments such as ricin gelonin pseudomonas exotoxin or diphtheria toxin. The selection of which conjugated or unconjugated polypeptide to use will depend on the type and stage of cancer use of adjunct treatment e.g. chemotherapy or external radiation and patient condition. It will be appreciated that one skilled in the art could readily make such a selection in view of the teachings herein.

It will be appreciated that in previous studies anti tumor antibodies labeled with isotopes have been used successfully to destroy cells in solid tumors as well as lymphomas leukemias in animal models and in some cases in humans. Exemplary radioisotopes include Y I I I I Rh Sm Ga Ho Lu Re and Re. The radionuclides act by producing ionizing radiation which causes multiple strand breaks in nuclear DNA leading to cell death. The isotopes used to produce therapeutic conjugates typically produce high energy or particles which have a short path length. Such radionuclides kill cells to which they are in close proximity for example neoplastic cells to which the conjugate has attached or has entered. They have little or no effect on non localized cells. Radionuclides are essentially non immunogenic.

With respect to the use of radiolabeled conjugates in conjunction with the present invention polypeptides of the invention may be directly labeled such as through iodination or may be labeled indirectly through the use of a chelating agent. As used herein the phrases indirect labeling and indirect labeling approach both mean that a chelating agent is covalently attached to a molecule and at least one radionuclide is associated with the chelating agent. Such chelating agents are typically referred to as bifunctional chelating agents as they bind both the polypeptide and the radioisotope. Particularly preferred chelating agents comprise 1 isothiocycmatobenzyl 3 methyldiothelene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA and cyclohexyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid CHX DTPA derivatives. Other chelating agents comprise P DOTA and EDTA derivatives. Particularly preferred radionuclides for indirect labeling include In and Y.

As used herein the phrases direct labeling and direct labeling approach both mean that a radionuclide is covalently attached directly to a polypeptide typically via an amino acid residue . More specifically these linking technologies include random labeling and site directed labeling. In the latter case the labeling is directed at specific sites on the polypeptide such as the N linked sugar residues present only on the Fc portion of the conjugates. Further various direct labeling techniques and protocols are compatible with the instant invention. For example Technetium 99m labeled polypeptides may be prepared by ligand exchange processes by reducing pertechnate TcO with stannous ion solution chelating the reduced technetium onto a Sephadex column and applying the polypeptides to this column or by batch labeling techniques e.g. by incubating pertechnate a reducing agent such as SnCl a buffer solution such as a sodium potassium phthalate solution and the molecules. In any event preferred radionuclides for directly labeling polypeptides are well known in the art and a particularly preferred radionuclide for direct labeling is I covalently attached via tyrosine residues. Polypeptides according to the invention may be derived for example with radioactive sodium or potassium iodide and a chemical oxidizing agent such as sodium hypochlorite chloramine T or the like or an enzymatic oxidizing agent such as lactoperoxidase glucose oxidase and glucose. However for the purposes of the present invention the indirect labeling approach is particularly preferred. Patents relating to chelators and chelator conjugates are known in the art. For instance U.S. Pat. No. 4 831 175 of Gansow is directed to polysubstituted diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid chelates and protein conjugates containing the same and methods for their preparation. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 099 069 5 246 692 5 286 850 5 434 287 and 5 124 471 of Gansow also relate to polysubstituted DTPA chelates. These patents are incorporated herein in their entirety. Other examples of compatible metal chelators are ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid DPTA 1 4 8 11 tetraazatetradecane 1 4 8 11 tetraazatetradecane 1 4 8 11 tetraacetic acid 1 oxa 4 7 12 15 tetraazaheptadecane 4 7 12 15 tetraacetic acid or the like. Cyclohexyl DTPA or CHX DTPA is particularly preferred. Still other compatible chelators including those yet to be discovered may easily be discerned by a skilled artisan and are clearly within the scope of the present invention.

Compatible chelators including the specific bifunctional chelator used to facilitate chelation in co pending application Ser. Nos. 08 475 813 08 475 815 and 08 478 967 are preferably selected to provide high affinity for trivalent metals exhibit increased tumor to non tumor ratios and decreased bone uptake as well as greater in vivo retention of radionuclide at target sites i.e. B cell lymphoma tumor sites. However other bifunctional chelators that may or may not possess all of these characteristics are known in the art and may also be beneficial in tumor therapy. It will also be appreciated that in accordance with the teachings herein polypeptides may be conjugated to different radiolabels for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To this end the aforementioned co pending applications herein incorporated by reference in their entirety disclose radiolabeled therapeutic conjugates for diagnostic imaging of tumors before administration of therapeutic molecule. In2B8 conjugate comprises a murine monoclonal antibody 2B8 specific to human CD20 antigen that is attached to In via a bifunctional chelator i.e. MX DTPA diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid which comprises a 1 1 mixture of 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyl DTPA and 1 methyl 3 isothiocyanatobenzyl DTPA. In is particularly preferred as a diagnostic radionuclide because between about 1 to about 10 mCi can be safely administered without detectable toxicity and the imaging data is generally predictive of subsequent Y labeled antibody distribution. Most imaging studies utilize 5 mCi In labeled antibody because this dose is both safe and has increased imaging efficiency compared with lower doses with optimal imaging occurring at three to six days after antibody administration. See for example Murray 26 3328 1985 and Carraguillo et al. 26 67 1985 .

As indicated above a variety of radionuclides are applicable to the present invention and those skilled in the can readily determine which radionuclide is most appropriate under various circumstances. For example I is a well known radionuclide used for targeted immunotherapy. However the clinical usefulness of I can be limited by several factors including eight day physical half life dehalogenation of iodinated antibody both in the blood and at tumor sites and emission characteristics e.g. large gamma component which can be suboptimal for localized dose deposition in tumor. With the advent of superior chelating agents the opportunity for attaching metal chelating groups to proteins has increased the opportunities to utilize other radionuclides such as In and Y. Y provides several benefits for utilization in radioimmunotherapeutic applications the 64 hour half life of Y is long enough to allow accumulation by tumor and unlike e.g. I Y is a pure beta emitter of high energy with no accompanying gamma irradiation in its decay with a range in tissue of 100 to 1 000 cell diameters. Furthermore the minimal amount of penetrating radiation allows for outpatient administration of Y labeled molecules. Additionally internalization of labeled polypeptides is not required for cell killing and the local emission of ionizing radiation should be lethal for adjacent tumor cells lacking the target antigen.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these non radioactive conjugates may also be assembled using a variety of techniques depending on the selected agent to be conjugated. For example conjugates with biotin are prepared e.g. by reacting the polypeptides with an activated ester of biotin such as the biotin N hydroxysuccinimide ester. Similarly conjugates with a fluorescent marker may be prepared in the presence of a coupling agent e.g. those listed above or by reaction with an isothiocyanate preferably fluorescein isothiocyanate. Conjugates of the polypeptides of the invention with cytostatic cytotoxic substances and metal chelates are prepared in an analogous manner.

Preferred agents for use in the present invention are cytotoxic drugs particularly those which are used for cancer therapy. As used herein a cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent means any agent that is detrimental to the growth and proliferation of cells and may act to reduce inhibit or destroy a cell or malignancy. Exemplary cytotoxins include but are not limited to radionuclides biotoxins enzymatically active toxins cytostatic or cytotoxic therapeutic agents prodrugs immunologically active ligands and biological response modifiers such as cytokines. Any cytotoxin that acts to retard or slow the growth of immunoreactive cells or malignant cells is within the scope of the present invention.

Exemplary cytotoxins include in general cytostatic agents alkylating agents antimetabolites anti proliferative agents tubulin binding agents hormones and hormone antagonists and the like. Exemplary cytostatics that are compatible with the present invention include alkylating substances such as mechlorethamine triethylenephosphoramide cyclophosphamide ifosfamide chlorambucil busulfan melphalan or triaziquone also nitrosourea compounds such as carmustine lomustine or semustine. Other preferred classes of cytotoxic agents include for example the maytansinoid family of drugs. Other preferred classes of cytotoxic agents include for example the anthracycline family of drugs the vinca drugs the mitomycins the bleomycins the cytotoxic nucleosides the pteridine family of drugs diynenes and the podophyllotoxins. Particularly useful members of those classes include for example adriamycin caminomycin daunorubicin daunomycin doxorubicin aminopterin methotrexate methopterin mithramycin streptonigrin dichloromethotrexate mitomycin C actinomycin D porfiromycin 5 fluorouracil floxuridine ftorafur 6 mercaptopurine cytarabine cytosine arabinoside podophyllotoxin or podophyllotoxin derivatives such as etoposide or etoposide phosphate melphalan vinblastine vincristine leurosidine vindesine leurosine and the like. Still other cytotoxins that are compatible with the teachings herein include taxol taxane cytochalasin B gramicidin D ethidium bromide emetine tenoposide colchicin dihydroxy anthracin dione mitoxantrone procaine tetracaine lidocaine propranolol and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Hormones and hormone antagonists such as corticosteroids e.g. prednisone progestins e.g. hydroxyprogesterone or medroprogesterone estrogens e.g. diethylstilbestrol antiestrogens e.g. tamoxifen androgens e.g. testosterone and aromatase inhibitors e.g. aminogluthetimide are also compatible with the teachings herein. As noted previously one skilled in the art may make chemical modifications to the desired compound in order to make reactions of that compound more convenient for purposes of preparing conjugates of the invention.

One example of particularly preferred cytotoxins comprise members or derivatives of the enediyne family of anti tumor antibiotics including calicheamicin esperamicins or dynemicins. These toxins are extremely potent and act by cleaving nuclear DNA leading to cell death. Unlike protein toxins which can be cleaved in vivo to give many inactive but immunogenic polypeptide fragments toxins such as calicheamicin esperamicins and other enediynes are small molecules which are essentially non immunogenic. These non peptide toxins are chemically linked to the dimers or tetramers by techniques which have been previously used to label monoclonal antibodies and other molecules. These linking technologies include site specific linkage via the N linked sugar residues present only on the Fc portion of the constructs. Such site directed linking methods have the advantage of reducing the possible effects of linkage on the binding properties of the constructs.

As previously alluded to compatible cytotoxins may comprise a prodrug. As used herein the term prodrug refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. Prodrugs compatible with the invention include but are not limited to phosphate containing prodrugs thiophosphate containing prodrugs sulfate containing prodrugs peptide containing prodrugs lactam containing prodrugs optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide containing prodrugs 5 fluorocytosine and other 5 fluorouridine prodrugs that can be converted to the more active cytotoxic free drug. Further examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in the present invention comprise those chemotherapeutic agents described above.

Among other cytotoxins it will be appreciated that polypeptides can also be associated with a biotoxin such as ricin subunit A abrin diptheria toxin botulinum cyanginosins saxitoxin shigatoxin tetanus tetrodotoxin trichothecene verrucologen or a toxic enzyme. Preferably such constructs will be made using genetic engineering techniques that allow for direct expression of the binding molecule toxin construct. Other biological response modifiers that may be associated with the polypeptides of the invention of the present invention comprise cytokines such as lymphokines and interferons. In view of the instant disclosure it is submitted that one skilled in the art could readily form such constructs using conventional techniques.

Another class of compatible cytotoxins that may be used in conjunction with the disclosed polypeptides are radiosensitizing drugs that may be effectively directed to tumor or immunoreactive cells. Such drugs enhance the sensitivity to ionizing radiation thereby increasing the efficacy of radiotherapy. An conjugate internalized by the tumor cell would deliver the radiosensitizer nearer the nucleus where radiosensitization would be maximal. The unbound radiosensitizer linked polypeptides of the invention would be cleared quickly from the blood localizing the remaining radiosensitization agent in the target tumor and providing minimal uptake in normal tissues. After rapid clearance from the blood adjunct radiotherapy would be administered in one of three ways 1. external beam radiation directed specifically to the tumor 2. radioactivity directly implanted in the tumor or 3. systemic radioimmunotherapy with the same targeting molecule. A potentially attractive variation of this approach would be the attachment of a therapeutic radioisotope to the radiosensitized immunoconjugate thereby providing the convenience of administering to the patient a single drug.

In one embodiment a moiety that enhances the stability or efficacy of the polypeptide can be conjugated. For example in one embodiment PEG can be conjugated to the polypeptides of the invention to increase their half life in vivo. Leong S. R. et al. 200116 106 200254 531 or Weir et al. 2002. Biochem. Soc. Transactions 30 512.

Methods of preparing and administering polypeptides of the invention to a subject are well known to or are readily determined by those skilled in the art. The route of administration of the polypeptide of the invention may be oral parenteral by inhalation or topical. The term parenteral as used herein includes intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal intramuscular subcutaneous rectal or vaginal administration. The intravenous intraarterial subcutaneous and intramuscular forms of parenteral administration are generally preferred. While all these forms of administration are clearly contemplated as being within the scope of the invention a form for administration would be a solution for injection in particular for intravenous or intraarterial injection or drip. Usually a suitable pharmaceutical composition for injection may comprise a buffer e.g. acetate phosphate or citrate buffer a surfactant e.g. polysorbate optionally a stabilizer agent e.g. human albumin etc. However in other methods compatible with the teachings herein the polypeptides can be delivered directly to the site of the adverse cellular population thereby increasing the exposure of the diseased tissue to the therapeutic agent.

Preparations for parenteral administration includes sterile aqueous or non aqueous solutions suspensions and emulsions. Examples of non aqueous solvents are propylene glycol polyethylene glycol vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water alcoholic aqueous solutions emulsions or suspensions including saline and buffered media. In the subject invention pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to 0.01 0.1M and preferably 0.05M phosphate buffer or 0.8 saline. Other common parenteral vehicles include sodium phosphate solutions Ringer s dextrose dextrose and sodium chloride lactated Ringer s or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers electrolyte replenishers such as those based on Ringer s dextrose and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as for example antimicrobials antioxidants chelating agents and inert gases and the like. More particularly pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions where water soluble or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In such cases the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and will preferably be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol e.g. glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol and the like and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol ascorbic acid thimerosal and the like. In many cases it will be preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars polyalcohols such as mannitol sorbitol or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

In any case sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating an active compound e.g. a polypeptide by itself or in combination with other active agents in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated herein as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying which yields a powder of an active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof. The preparations for injections are processed filled into containers such as ampoules bags bottles syringes or vials and sealed under aseptic conditions according to methods known in the art. Further the preparations may be packaged and sold in the form of a kit such as those described in co pending U.S. Ser. No. 09 259 337 and U.S. Ser. No. 09 259 338 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such articles of manufacture will preferably have labels or package inserts indicating that the associated compositions are useful for treating a subject suffering from or predisposed to autoimmune or neoplastic disorders. Effective doses of the compositions of the present invention for the treatment of the above described conditions vary depending upon many different factors including means of administration target site physiological state of the patient whether the patient is human or an animal other medications administered and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Usually the patient is a human but non human mammals including transgenic mammals can also be treated. Treatment dosages may be titrated using routine methods known to those of skill in the art to optimize safety and efficacy. For passive immunization with an antibody the dosage can range e.g. from about 0.0001 to 100 mg kg and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg kg e.g. 0.02 mg kg 0.25 mg kg 0.5 mg kg 0.75 mg kg 1 mg kg 2 mg kg etc. of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 1 mg kg body weight or 10 mg kg body weight or within the range of 1 10 mg kg preferably at least 1 mg kg. Doses intermediate in the above ranges are also intended to be within the scope of the invention. Subjects can be administered such doses daily on alternative days weekly or according to any other schedule determined by empirical analysis. An exemplary treatment entails administration in multiple dosages over a prolonged period for example of at least six months. Additional exemplary treatment regimes entail administration once per every two weeks or once a month or once every 3 to 6 months. Exemplary dosage schedules include 1 10 mg kg or 15 mg kg on consecutive days 30 mg kg on alternate days or 60 mg kg weekly. In some methods two or more monoclonal antibodies with different binding specificities are administered simultaneously in which case the dosage of each antibody administered falls within the ranges indicated.

Polypeptides of the invention can be administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be weekly monthly or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of polypeptide or antigen in the patient. In some methods dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma polypeptide concentration of 1 1000 g ml and in some methods 25 300 g ml. Alternatively binding molecules can be administered as a sustained release formulation in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half life of the molecule in the patient. In general humanized antibodies show the longest half life followed by chimeric antibodies and nonhuman antibodies. In one embodiment the binding molecules of the invention can be administered in unconjugated form In another embodiment the polypeptides of the invention can be administered multiple times in conjugated form. In still another embodiment the binding molecules of the invention can be administered in unconjugated form then in conjugated form or vice versa.

The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications compositions containing the present polypeptides or a cocktail thereof are administered to a patient not already in the disease state to enhance the patient s resistance. Such an amount is defined to be a prophylactic effective dose. In this use the precise amounts again depend upon the patient s state of health and general immunity but generally range from 0.1 to 25 mg per dose especially 0.5 to 2.5 mg per dose. A relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives.

In therapeutic applications a relatively high dosage e.g. from about 1 to 400 mg kg of antibody per dose with dosages of from 5 to 25 mg being more commonly used for radioimmunoconjugates and higher doses for cytotoxin drug conjugated molecules at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter the patent can be administered a prophylactic regime.

In one embodiment a subject can be treated with a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide of the invention e.g. in a vector . Doses for nucleic acids encoding polypeptides range from about 10 ng to 1 g 100 ng to 100 mg 1 g to 10 mg or 30 300 g DNA per patient. Doses for infectious viral vectors vary from 10 100 or more virions per dose.

Therapeutic agents can be administered by parenteral topical intravenous oral subcutaneous intraarterial intracranial intraperitoneal intranasal or intramuscular means for prophylactic and or therapeutic treatment. The most typical route of administration of an immunogenic agent is subcutaneous although other routes can be equally effective. The next most common route is intramuscular injection. This type of injection is most typically performed in the arm or leg muscles. In some methods agents are injected directly into a particular tissue where deposits have accumulated for example intracranial injection. Intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion are preferred for administration of molecules. In some methods particular therapeutic molecules are injected directly into the cranium. In some methods molecules are administered as a sustained release composition or device such as a Medipad device.

Agents of the invention can optionally be administered in combination with other agents that are effective in treating the disorder or condition in need of treatment e.g. prophylactic or therapeutic .

Effective single treatment dosages i.e. therapeutically effective amounts of Y labeled polypeptides of the invention range from between about 5 and about 75 mCi more preferably between about 10 and about 40 mCi. Effective single treatment non marrow ablative dosages of I labeled antibodies range from between about 5 and about 70 mCi more preferably between about 5 and about 40 mCi. Effective single treatment ablative dosages i.e. may require autologous bone marrow transplantation of I labeled antibodies range from between about 30 and about 600 mCi more preferably between about 50 and less than about 500 mCi. In conjunction with a chimeric antibody owing to the longer circulating half life vis vis murine antibodies an effective single treatment non marrow ablative dosages of iodine 131 labeled chimeric antibodies range from between about 5 and about 40 mCi more preferably less than about 30 mCi. Imaging criteria for e.g. the In label are typically less than about 5 mCi.

While a great deal of clinical experience has been gained with I and Y other radiolabels are known in the art and have been used for similar purposes. Still other radioisotopes are used for imaging. For example additional radioisotopes which are compatible with the scope of the instant invention include but are not limited to I I P Co Cu Cu Br Rb Kr Sr In Cs Cs I Hg Pb Bi Lu Re Pb Bi Sc Rh Pd Sm Re Au Ac At and Bi. In this respect alpha gamma and beta emitters are all compatible with in the instant invention. Further in view of the instant disclosure it is submitted that one skilled in the art could readily determine which radionuclides are compatible with a selected course of treatment without undue experimentation. To this end additional radionuclides which have already been used in clinical diagnosis include I I Tc K Fe Ga Ga as well as In. Antibodies have also been labeled with a variety of radionuclides for potential use in targeted immunotherapy Peirersz et al. 65 111 125 1987 . These radionuclides include Re and Re as well as Au and Cu to a lesser extent. U.S. Pat. No. 5 460 785 provides additional data regarding such radioisotopes and is incorporated herein by reference.

Whether or not the polypeptides of the invention are used in a conjugated or unconjugated form it will be appreciated that a major advantage of the present invention is the ability to use these polypeptides in myelosuppressed patients especially those who are undergoing or have undergone adjunct therapies such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy. That is the beneficial delivery profile i.e. relatively short serum dwell time high binding affinity and enhanced localization of the polypeptides makes them particularly useful for treating patients that have reduced red marrow reserves and are sensitive to myelotoxicity. In this regard the unique delivery profile of the polypeptides make them very effective for the administration of radiolabeled conjugates to myelosuppressed cancer patients. As such the polypeptides of the invention are useful in a conjugated or unconjugated form in patients that have previously undergone adjunct therapies such as external beam radiation or chemotherapy. In other preferred embodiments the polypeptides again in a conjugated or unconjugated form may be used in a combined therapeutic regimen with chemotherapeutic agents. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such therapeutic regimens may comprise the sequential simultaneous concurrent or coextensive administration of the disclosed molecules and one or more chemotherapeutic agents. Particularly preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention will comprise the administration of a radiolabeled polypeptide.

While the polypeptides may be administered as described immediately above it must be emphasized that in other embodiments conjugated and unconjugated polypeptides may be administered to otherwise healthy patients as a first line therapeutic agent. In such embodiments the polypeptides may be administered to patients having normal or average red marrow reserves and or to patients that have not and are not undergoing adjunct therapies such as external beam radiation or chemotherapy.

However as discussed above selected embodiments of the invention comprise the administration of polypeptides to myelosuppressed patients or in combination or conjunction with one or more adjunct therapies such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy i.e. a combined therapeutic regimen . As used herein the administration of polypeptides in conjunction or combination with an adjunct therapy means the sequential simultaneous coextensive concurrent concomitant or contemporaneous administration or application of the therapy and the disclosed molecules. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the administration or application of the various components of the combined therapeutic regimen may be timed to enhance the overall effectiveness of the treatment. For example chemotherapeutic agents could be administered in standard well known courses of treatment followed within a few weeks by radioimmunoconjugates of the present invention. Conversely cytotoxin associated polypeptides could be administered intravenously followed by tumor localized external beam radiation. In yet other embodiments the polypeptide may be administered concurrently with one or more selected chemotherapeutic agents in a single office visit. A skilled artisan e.g. an experienced oncologist would be readily be able to discern effective combined therapeutic regimens without undue experimentation based on the selected adjunct therapy and the teachings of the instant specification.

In this regard it will be appreciated that the combination of the polypeptide with or without cytotoxin and the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered in any order and within any time frame that provides a therapeutic benefit to the patient. That is the chemotherapeutic agent and polypeptide may be administered in any order or concurrently. In selected embodiments the polypeptides of the present invention will be administered to patients that have previously undergone chemotherapy. In yet other embodiments the polypeptides and the chemotherapeutic treatment will be administered substantially simultaneously or concurrently. For example the patient may be given the binding molecule while undergoing a course of chemotherapy. In preferred embodiments the binding molecule will be administered within 1 year of any chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. In other preferred embodiments the polypeptide will be administered within 10 8 6 4 or 2 months of any chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. In still other preferred embodiments the polypeptide will be administered within 4 3 2 or 1 week of any chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. In yet other embodiments the polypeptide will be administered within 5 4 3 2 or 1 days of the selected chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. It will further be appreciated that the two agents or treatments may be administered to the patient within a matter of hours or minutes i.e. substantially simultaneously .

Moreover in accordance with the present invention a myelosuppressed patient shall be held to mean any patient exhibiting lowered blood counts. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are several blood count parameters conventionally used as clinical indicators of myelosuppresion and one can easily measure the extent to which myelosuppresion is occurring in a patient. Examples of art accepted myelosuppression measurements are the Absolute Neutrophil Count ANC or platelet count. Such myelosuppression or partial myeloablation may be a result of various biochemical disorders or diseases or more likely as the result of prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In this respect those skilled in the art will appreciate that patients who have undergone traditional chemotherapy typically exhibit reduced red marrow reserves. As discussed above such subjects often cannot be treated using optimal levels of cytotoxin i.e. radionuclides due to unacceptable side effects such as anemia or immunosuppression that result in increased mortality or morbidity.

More specifically conjugated or unconjugated polypeptides of the present invention may be used to effectively treat patients having ANCs lower than about 2000 mmor platelet counts lower than about 150 000 mm. More preferably the polypeptides of the present invention may be used to treat patients having ANCs of less than about 1500 mm less than about 1000 mmor even more preferably less than about 500 mm. Similarly the polypeptides of the present invention may be used to treat patients having a platelet count of less than about 75 000 mm less than about 50 000 mmor even less than about 10 000 mm. In a more general sense those skilled in the art will easily be able to determine when a patient is myelosuppressed using government implemented guidelines and procedures.

As indicated above many myelosuppressed patients have undergone courses of treatment including chemotherapy implant radiotherapy or external beam radiotherapy. In the case of the latter an external radiation source is for local irradiation of a malignancy. For radiotherapy implantation methods radioactive reagents are surgically located within the malignancy thereby selectively irradiating the site of the disease. In any event the disclosed polypeptides may be used to treat disorders in patients exhibiting myelosuppression regardless of the cause.

In this regard it will further be appreciated that the polypeptides of the instant invention may be used in conjunction or combination with any chemotherapeutic agent or agents e.g. to provide a combined therapeutic regimen that eliminates reduces inhibits or controls the growth of neoplastic cells in vivo. As discussed such agents often result in the reduction of red marrow reserves. This reduction may be offset in whole or in part by the diminished myelotoxicity of the compounds of the present invention that advantageously allow for the aggressive treatment of neoplasias in such patients. In other preferred embodiments the radiolabeled immunoconjugates disclosed herein may be effectively used with radiosensitizers that increase the susceptibility of the neoplastic cells to radionuclides. For example radiosensitizing compounds may be administered after the radiolabeled binding molecule has been largely cleared from the bloodstream but still remains at therapeutically effective levels at the site of the tumor or tumors.

With respect to these aspects of the invention exemplary chemotherapeutic agents that are compatible with the instant invention include alkylating agents vinca alkaloids e.g. vincristine and vinblastine procarbazine methotrexate and prednisone. The four drug combination MOPP mechlethamine nitrogen mustard vincristine Oncovin procarbazine and prednisone is very effective in treating various types of lymphoma and comprises a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In MOPP resistant patients ABVD e.g. adriamycin bleomycin vinblastine and dacarbazine Ch1VPP chlorambucil vinblastine procarbazine and prednisone CABS lomustine doxorubicin bleomycin and streptozotocin MOPP plus ABVD MOPP plus ABV doxorubicin bleomycin and vinblastine or BCVPP carmustine cyclophosphamide vinblastine procarbazine and prednisone combinations can be used. Arnold S. Freedman and Lee M. Nadler in HPIM1774 1788 Kurt J. Isselbacher et al. eds. 13ed. 1994 and V. T. DeVita et al. 1997 and the references cited therein for standard dosing and scheduling. These therapies can be used unchanged or altered as needed for a particular patient in combination with one or more polypeptides of the invention as described herein.

Additional regimens that are useful in the context of the present invention include use of single alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil or combinations such as CVP cyclophosphamide vincristine and prednisone CHOP CVP and doxorubicin C MOPP cyclophosphamide vincristine prednisone and procarbazine CAP BOP CHOP plus procarbazine and bleomycin m BACOD CHOP plus methotrexate bleomycin and leucovorin ProMACE MOPP prednisone methotrexate doxorubicin cyclophosphamide etoposide and leucovorin plus standard MOPP ProMACE CytaBOM prednisone doxorubicin cyclophosphamide etoposide cytarabine bleomycin vincristine methotrexate and leucovorin and MACOP B methotrexate doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine fixed dose prednisone bleomycin and leucovorin . Those skilled in the art will readily be able to determine standard dosages and scheduling for each of these regimens. CHOP has also been combined with bleomycin methotrexate procarbazine nitrogen mustard cytosine arabinoside and etoposide. Other compatible chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to 2 chlorodeoxyadenosine 2 CDA 2 deoxycoformycin and fludarabine.

For patients with intermediate and high grade NHL who fail to achieve remission or relapse salvage therapy is used. Salvage therapies employ drugs such as cytosine arabinoside cisplatin etoposide and ifosfamide given alone or in combination. In relapsed or aggressive forms of certain neoplastic disorders the following protocols are often used IMVP 16 ifosfamide methotrexate and etoposide MIME methyl gag ifosfamide methotrexate and etoposide DHAP dexamethasone high dose cytarabine and cisplatin ESHAP etoposide methylpredisolone HD cytarabine cisplatin CEPP B cyclophosphamide etoposide procarbazine prednisone and bleomycin and CAMP lomustine mitoxantrone cytarabine and prednisone each with well known dosing rates and schedules.

The amount of chemotherapeutic agent to be used in combination with the polypeptides of the instant invention may vary by subject or may be administered according to what is known in the art. See for example Bruce A Chabner et al. in G GTPBT1233 1287 Joel G. Hardman et al. eds. 9ed. 1996 . As previously discussed the polypeptides of the present invention immunoreactive fragments or recombinants thereof may be administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount for the in vivo treatment of mammalian disorders. In this regard it will be appreciated that the disclosed binding molecules will be formulated so as to facilitate administration and promote stability of the active agent. Preferably pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the present invention comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic sterile carrier such as physiological saline non toxic buffers preservatives and the like. For the purposes of the instant application a pharmaceutically effective amount of the polypeptide immunoreactive fragment or recombinant thereof conjugated or unconjugated to a therapeutic agent shall be held to mean an amount sufficient to achieve effective binding to an antigen and to achieve a benefit e.g. to ameliorate symptoms of a disease or disorder or to detect a substance or a cell. In the case of tumor cells the polypeptide will be preferably be capable of interacting with selected immunoreactive antigens on neoplastic or immunoreactive cells and provide for an increase in the death of those cells. Of course the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in single or multiple doses to provide for a pharmaceutically effective amount of the polypeptide.

In keeping with the scope of the present disclosure the polypeptides of the invention may be administered to a human or other animal in accordance with the aforementioned methods of treatment in an amount sufficient to produce a therapeutic or prophylactic effect. The binding molecules of the invention can be administered to such human or other animal in a conventional dosage form prepared by combining the binding molecule of the invention with a conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent according to known techniques. It will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the form and character of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent is dictated by the amount of active ingredient with which it is to be combined the route of administration and other well known variables. Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that a cocktail comprising one or more species of polypeptides according to the present invention may prove to be particularly effective.

The polypeptides of the invention can be used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide compounds compositions kits and methods for the diagnosis and or treatment of disorders e.g. neoplastic disorders in a mammalian subject in need of such treatment. Preferably the subject is a human.

The polypeptides of the instant invention will be useful in a number of different applications. For example in one embodiment the subject binding molecules should be useful for reducing or eliminating cells bearing an epitope recognized by a binding molecule of the invention. In another embodiment the subject binding molecules are effective in reducing the concentration of or eliminating soluble antigen in the circulation

In one embodiment tumor size inhibiting tumor growth and or prolonging the survival time of tumor bearing animals. Accordingly this invention also relates to a method of treating tumors in a human or other animal by administering to such human or animal an effective non toxic amount of polypeptide. One skilled in the art would be able by routine experimentation to determine what an effective non toxic amount of polypeptide would be for the purpose of treating malignancies. For example a therapeutically active amount of a polypeptide may vary according to factors such as the disease stage e.g. stage I versus stage IV age sex medical complications e.g. immunosuppressed conditions or diseases and weight of the subject and the ability of the molecule to elicit a desired response in the subject. The dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. Generally however an effective dosage is expected to be in the range of about 0.05 to 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day and more preferably from about 0.5 to 10 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day.

For purposes of clarification mammal refers to any animal classified as a mammal including humans domestic and farm animals and zoo sports or pet animals such as dogs horses cats cows etc. Preferably the mammal is human. Treatment refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disease or disorder as well as those in which the disease or disorder is to be prevented. Hence the mammal may have been diagnosed as having the disease or disorder or may be predisposed or susceptible to the disease.

As discussed above the polypeptides of the present invention may be immunoreactive with one or more tumor antigens or antigens associated with immune disorders. For example for neoplastic disorders the antigen binding site i.e. the variable region or immunoreactive fragment or recombinant thereof of the disclosed polypeptides binds to a selected tumor associated antigen at the site of the malignancy. Similarly in immune including autoimmune disorders the disclosed polypeptides will bind to selected markers on the offending cells. Given the number of reported antigens associated with neoplasias and immune disorders and the number of related antibodies those skilled in the art will appreciate that the presently disclosed polypeptides may therefore be derived from any one of a number of whole antibodies. More generally polypeptides useful in the present invention may be obtained or derived from any antibody including those previously reported in the literature that reacts with a molecule or marker associated with the selected condition. Further the parent or precursor antibody or fragment thereof used to generate the disclosed polypeptides may be murine human chimeric humanized non human primate or primatized. In other preferred embodiments the polypeptides of the present invention may comprise single chain antibody constructs such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 892 019 which is incorporated herein by reference having altered constant domains as described herein. Consequently any of these types of antibodies modified in accordance with the teachings herein is compatible with the instant invention.

As used herein tumor associated antigens means any antigen which is generally associated with tumor cells i.e. occurring at the same or to a greater extent as compared with normal cells. More generally tumor associated antigens comprise any antigen that provides for the localization of immunoreactive antibodies at a neoplastic cell irrespective of its expression on non malignant cells. Such antigens may be relatively tumor specific and limited in their expression to the surface of malignant cells. Alternatively such antigens may be found on both malignant and non malignant cells. For example CD20 is a pan B antigen that is found on the surface of both malignant and non malignant B cells that has proved to be an extremely effective target for immunotherapeutic antibodies for the treatment of non Hodgkin s lymphoma. In this respect pan T cell antigens such as CD2 CD3 CD5 CD6 and CD7 also comprise tumor associated antigens within the meaning of the present invention. Still other exemplary tumor associated antigens comprise but not limited to MAGE 1 MAGE 3 MUC 1 HPV 16 HPV E6 E7 TAG 72 CEA L6 Antigen CD19 CD22 CD37 CD52 HLA DR EGF Receptor and HER2 Receptor. In many cases immunoreactive antibodies for each of these antigens have been reported in the literature. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each of these antibodies may serve as a precursor for polypeptides of the invention in accordance with the present invention.

The polypeptides of the present invention preferably associate with and bind to tumor or immune associated antigens as described above. Accordingly as will be discussed in some detail below the polypeptides of the present invention may be derived generated or fabricated from any one of a number of antibodies that react with tumor associated antigens. In preferred embodiments the polypeptides are modified or domain deleted antibodies that are derived using common genetic engineering techniques whereby at least a portion of one or more constant region domains are deleted or altered so as to provide the desired biochemical characteristics such as reduced serum half life. More particularly one skilled in the art may readily isolate the genetic sequence corresponding to the variable and or constant regions of the subject antibody and delete or alter the appropriate nucleotides to provide polypeptides of the invention for use as monomeric subunits in accordance with the instant invention.

In a first preferred embodiment the polypeptide will bind to the same tumor associated antigen as Rituxan . Rituxan also known as rituximab IDEC C2B8 and C2B8 was the first FDA approved monoclonal antibody for treatment of human B cell lymphoma see U.S. Pat.

Rituxan is a chimeric anti CD20 monoclonal antibody which is growth inhibitory and reportedly sensitizes certain lymphoma cell lines for apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents in vitro. The antibody efficiently binds human complement has strong FcR binding and can effectively kill human lymphocytes in vitro via both complement dependent CDC and antibody dependent ADCC mechanisms Reff et al. 83 435 445 1994 . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that dimeric variants homodimers or heterodimers of C2B8 or 2B8 modified according to the instant disclosure may be used in conjugated or unconjugated forms to effectively treat patients presenting with CD20 malignancies. More generally it must be reiterated that the polypeptides disclosed herein may be used in either a naked or unconjugated state or conjugated to a cytotoxic agent to effectively treat any one of a number of disorders. In other preferred embodiments of the present invention the polypeptide of the invention will be derived from or bind to the same tumor associated antigen as CC49. As previously alluded to CC49 binds human tumor associated antigen TAG 72 which is associated with the surface of certain tumor cells of human origin specifically the LS174T tumor cell line. LS174T American Type Culture Collection herein ATCC No. CL 188 is a variant of the LS180 ATCC No. CL 187 colon adenocarcinoma line.

It will further be appreciated that numerous murine monoclonal antibodies have been developed which have binding specificity for TAG 72. One of these monoclonal antibodies designated B72.3 is a murine IgG1 produced by hybridoma B72.3 ATCC No. HB 8108 . B72.3 is a first generation monoclonal antibody developed using a human breast carcinoma extract as the immunogen see Colcher et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78 3199 3203 1981 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 522 918 and 4 612 282 each of which is incorporated herein by reference . Other monoclonal antibodies directed against TAG 72 are designated CC for colon cancer . As described by Schlom et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 512 443 which is incorporated herein by reference CC monoclonal antibodies are a family of second generation murine monoclonal antibodies that were prepared using TAG 72 purified with B72.3. Because of their relatively good binding affinities to TAG 72 the following CC antibodies have been deposited at the ATCC with restricted access having been requested CC49 ATCC No. HB 9459 CC 83 ATCC No. HB 9453 CC46 ATCC No. HB 9458 CC92 ATTCC No. HB 9454 CC30 ATCC No. HB 9457 CC11 ATCC No. 9455 and CC15 ATCC No. HB 9460 . U.S. Pat. No. 5 512 443 further teaches that the disclosed antibodies may be altered into their chimeric form by substituting e.g. human constant regions Fc domains for mouse constant regions by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. Besides disclosing murine and chimeric anti TAG 72 antibodies Schlom et al. have also produced variants of a humanized CC49 antibody as disclosed in PCT US99 25552 and single chain constructs as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 892 019 each of which is also incorporated herein by reference. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each of the foregoing antibodies constructs or recombinants and variations thereof may be modified and used to provide polypeptides in accordance with the present invention.

In addition to the anti TAG 72 antibodies discussed above various groups have also reported the construction and partial characterization of domain deleted CC49 and B72.3 antibodies e.g. Calvo et al. 8 1 95 109 1993 Slavin Chiorini et al. 53 97 103 1993 and Slavin Chiorini et al. 55 5957 5967 1995

Still other preferred embodiments of the present invention comprise modified antibodies that are derived from or bind to the same tumor associated antigen as C5E10. As set forth in co pending application Ser. No. 09 104 717 C5E10 is an antibody that recognizes a glycoprotein determinant of approximately 115 kDa that appears to be specific to prostate tumor cell lines e.g. DU145 PC3 or ND1 . Thus in conjunction with the present invention polypeptides e.g. CH2 domain deleted antibodies that specifically bind to the same tumor associated antigen recognized by C5E10 antibodies could be produced and used in a conjugated or unconjugated form for the treatment of neoplastic disorders. In particularly preferred embodiments the modified antibody will be derived or comprise all or part of the antigen binding region of the C5E10 antibody as secreted from the hybridoma cell line having ATCC accession No. PTA 865. The resulting modified antibody could then be conjugated to a radionuclide as described below and administered to a patient suffering from prostate cancer in accordance with the methods herein.

In general the disclosed invention may be used to prophylactically or therapeutically treat any neoplasm comprising an antigenic marker that allows for the targeting of the cancerous cells by the binding molecule. Exemplary cancers that may be treated include but are not limited to prostate gastric carcinomas such as colon skin breast ovarian lung and pancreatic. More particularly the binding molecules of the instant invention may be used to treat Kaposi s sarcoma CNS neoplasias capillary hemangioblastomas meningiomas and cerebral metastases melanoma gastrointestinal and renal sarcomas rhabdomyosarcoma glioblastoma preferably glioblastoma multiforme leiomyosarcoma retinoblastoma papillary cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary Wilm s tumor or small cell lung carcinoma. It will be appreciated that appropriate polypeptides may be derived for tumor associated antigens related to each of the forgoing neoplasias without undue experimentation in view of the instant disclosure. Exemplary hematologic malignancies that are amenable to treatment with the disclosed invention include Hodgkins and non Hodgkins lymphoma as well as leukemias including ALL L3 Burkitt s type leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL and monocytic cell leukemias. It will be appreciated that the compounds and methods of the present invention are particularly effective in treating a variety of B cell lymphomas including low grade follicular non Hodgkin s lymphoma NHL cell lymphoma FCC mantle cell lymphoma MCL diffuse large cell lymphoma DLCL small lymphocytic SL NHL intermediate grade follicular NHL intermediate grade diffuse NHL high grade immunoblastic NHL high grade lymphoblastic NHL high grade small non cleaved cell NHL bulky disease NHL and Waldenstrom s Macroglobulinemia. It should be clear to those of skill in the art that these lymphomas will often have different names due to changing systems of classification and that patients having lymphomas classified under different names may also benefit from the combined therapeutic regimens of the present invention. In addition to the aforementioned neoplastic disorders it will be appreciated that the disclosed invention may advantageously be used to treat additional malignancies bearing compatible tumor associated antigens.

Besides neoplastic disorders the polypeptides of the instant invention are particularly effective in the treatment of autoimmune disorders or abnormal immune responses. In this regard it will be appreciated that the polypeptide of the present invention may be used to control suppress modulate or eliminate unwanted immune responses to both external and autoantigens. For example in one embodiment the antigen is an autoantigen. In another embodiment the antigen is an allergen. In yet other embodiments the antigen is an alloantigen or xenoantigen. Use of the disclosed polypeptides to reduce an immune response to alloantigens and xenoantigens is of particular use in transplantation for example to inhibit rejection by a transplant recipient of a donor graft e.g. a tissue or organ graft or bone marrow transplant. Additionally suppression or elimination of donor T cells within a bone marrow graft is useful for inhibiting graft versus host disease.

In yet other embodiments the polypeptides of the present invention may be used to treat immune disorders that include but are not limited to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis Allergic rhinitis Autoimmune hemolytic anemia Acanthosis nigricans Allergic contact dermatitis Addison s disease Atopic dermatitis Alopecia areata Alopecia universalis Amyloidosis Anaphylactoid purpura Anaphylactoid reaction Aplastic anemia Angioedema hereditary Angioedema idiopathic Ankylosing spondylitis Arteritis cranial Arteritis giant cell Arteritis Takayasu s Arteritis temporal Asthma Ataxia telangiectasia Autoiimmune oophoritis Autoimmune orchitis Autoimmune polyendocrine failure Behcet s disease Berger s disease Buerger s disease bronchitis Bullous pemphigus Candidiasis chronic mucocutaneous Caplan s syndrome Post myocardial infarction syndrome Post pericardiotomy syndrome Carditis Celiac sprue Chagas s disease Chediak Higashi syndrome Churg Strauss disease Cogan s syndrome Cold agglutinin disease CREST syndrome Crohn s disease Cryoglobulinemia Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis Dermatitis herpetifomis Dermatomyositis Diabetes mellitus Diamond Blackfan syndrome DiGeorge syndrome Discoid lupus erythematosus Eosinophilic fasciitis Episcleritis Drythema elevatum diutinum Erythema marginatum Erythema multiforme Erythema nodosum Familial Mediterranean fever Felty s syndrome Fibrosis pulmonary Glomerulonephritis anaphylactoid Glomerulonephritis autoimmune Glomerulonephritis post streptococcal Glomerulonephritis post transplantation Glomerulopathy membranous Goodpasture s syndrome Granulocytopenia immune mediated Granuloma annulare Granulomatosis allergic Granulomatous myositis Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis Hemolytic disease of the newborn Hemochromatosis idiopathic Henoch Schoenlein purpura Hepatitis chronic active and chronic progressive Histiocytosis X Hypereosinophilic syndrome Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura Job s syndrome Juvenile dermatomyositis Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis Juvenile chronic arthritis Kawasaki s disease Keratitis Keratoconjunctivitis sicca Landry Guillain Barre Strohl syndrome Leprosy lepromatous Loeffler s syndrome lupus Lyell s syndrome Lyme disease Lymphomatoid granulomatosis Mastocytosis systemic Mixed connective tissue disease Mononeuritis multiplex Muckle Wells syndrome Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis Multiple sclerosis Myasthenia gravis Mycosis fungoides Necrotizing vasculitis systemic Nephrotic syndrome Overlap syndrome Panniculitis Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria Pemphigoid Pemphigus Pemphigus erythema tosus Pemphigus foliaceus Pemphigus vulgaris Pigeon breeder s disease Pneumonitis hypersensitivity Polyarteritis nodosa Polymyalgia rheumatic Polymyositis Polyneuritis idiopathic Portuguese familial polyneuropathies Pre eclampsia eclampsia Primary biliary cirrhosis Progressive systemic sclerosis Scleroderma Psoriasis Psoriatic arthritis Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis Pulmonary fibrosis Raynaud s phenomenon syndrome Reidel s thyroiditis Reiter s syndrome Relapsing polychrondritis Rheumatic fever Rheumatoid arthritis Sarcoidosis Scleritis Sclerosing cholangitis Serum sickness Sezary syndrome Sjogren s syndrome Stevens Johnson syndrome Still s disease Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis Sympathetic ophthalmia Systemic lupus erythematosus Transplant rejection Ulcerative colitis Undifferentiated connective tissue disease Urticaria chronic Urticaria cold Uveitis Vitiligo Weber Christian disease Wegener s granulomatosis and Wiskott Aldrich syndrome.

In another embodiment the binding molecules of the invention can be used for pretargeting applications. For example the same advantages will be apparent in pretargeting applications for chemotherapeutic drug delivery.

For example in pretargeting a tumor is pretargeted with a binding construct that has affinity for the tumor associated antigen on the one hand and for e.g. a radiolabeled hapten on the other. The radiolabeled hapten is administered later preferably after the binding molecule has cleared see e.g. Boerman et al. 2003. J. Nuclear Med. 44 400 . In another example an antibody which is non toxic but has been derivitized to react with a drug or prodrug that is toxic only when bound by the binding molecule. Given the biodistribution data in the instant examples the binding molecules of the invention are well suited to use in pretargeting applications. In one embodiment a clearing agent could be eliminated from the pretargeting methodology by using the instant binding molecules.

This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application are incorporated herein by reference.

Solutions of antibody molecules comprise two different isoforms. One form Form A comprises heavy chain molecules that are linked via at least one disulfide linkage. The other form Form B comprises heavy chain molecules that are not linked via at least one disulfide linkage. Form B does not appear or appears at a very low frequency in with intact gamma 1 MAbs such as Rituxan . However with domain deleted dd constructs having a similar hinge the frequency of Form B is much higher. These forms can be distinguished using denaturing non reducing SDS page. In domain deleted antibody preparations Form A appears as a 120 kDa dimer while Form B appears as a 60 kDa monomer.

Hinge domains can be subdivided into three distinct regions upper middle and lower hinge regions Roux et al. J. Immunol. 1998 161 4083 . Polypeptide sequences encompassing these regions for IgG1 and IgG3 hinges are shown in Table 1. The IgG3 hinge middle region contains in addition to the two conserved cysteine residues a 15 amino acid motif that repeats three times. Amino acid sequences from these regions were used to design synthetic IgG1 IgG3 connecting peptides. These consisted of IgG1 upper hinge residues corresponding to positions 226 through 238 an IgG1 middle hinge corresponding to positions 239 through 241 and a single IgG3 middle hinge repeat motif corresponding to positions 241EE through 242 combined with either an added proline at position 243 or an added proline alanine proline at positions 243 244 and 245 respectively Kabat numbering system followed by a flexible Gly Ser spacer Table 2 . In addition novel connecting peptides were designed consisting of a serine amino acid residue substituted for the cysteine at positions 239 or 242 combined with either an added proline at position 243 or an added proline alanine proline at positions 243 244 and 245 respectively Kabat numbering system . Pro243Ala244Pro245 and Pro 243 connecting peptides were also made. The amino acid sequence of the parent CH2 domain deleted humanized CC49 connecting peptide beginning at the first residue of the IgG1 hinge position 226 Kabat numbering system to the last residue of the hinge GlySer connecting peptide is shown in Table 2. Also shown are the various connecting peptide designs by alignment to CC49 with positions of the cysteine residues indicated in Kabat numbering system.

Nucleic acid sequences encoding the hinge region connecting peptides shown in Table 2 were introduced into CH2 domain deleted huCC49 gene sequences using the Splicing by Overlap Extension SOE method Horton R. M. 1993 Methods in Molecular Biology Vol 15 PCR Protocols Current Methods and applications. Ed. B. A. White . Correct modifications to the hinge region were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA was used to transform CHO DG44 cells for stable production of antibody protein.

CH2 domain deleted huCC49 antibodies containing the eight designed synthetic connecting peptides indicated in Table 2 were constructed and antibody produced in CHO DG44 cells. Supernatants were collected from isolated cell lines and concentration of antibody in the culture supernatants determined by immunoassay. Supernatants containing antibody ranging from 0 to 30 ng of total antibody protein from each cell line was analyzed by non reducing SDS PAGE electrophoresis followed by Western Blot with anti human kappa HRP conjugated antibody to detect CH2 domain deleted huCC49 Form A and Form B isoforms. Under these conditions Form A migrates as a single 120 kDa homodimer and Form B as a 60 kDa doublet. Also visible are kappa chain monomer and dimers. Connecting peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs 9 9 14 and 15 were all found to increase the proportion of Form A produced.

These data show that novel engineered synthetic hinge region connecting peptides can be used to preferentially favor the formation of the A or B isoform. These studies also reveal the importance of the cysteine residues at position 242 Kabat numbering system in synthesizing the CH2 domain deleted antibody Form A isoform. Substituting the cysteine at either position 239 or 242 with serine e.g. using connecting peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs 10 11 12 or 13 shifts CH2 domain deleted antibody biosynthesis to the Form B isoform. Accordingly in one embodiment a connecting peptide of the invention comprises a cysteine at least one of position 239 or 242. The use of connecting peptides which increase the proportion of Form A produced will lead to a beneficial improvement in process yield and or stability. These synthetic hinge region connecting peptides are useful for favoring synthesis of CH2 domain deleted antibody Form A isoform for any antibody isotype e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 based on the extremely high degree of homology among the CH3 domains for all four human isotypes. Including identical and conserved amino acid residues IgG1 CH3 domain is 98.13 homologous to IgG2 CH3 97.20 homologous to IgG3 CH3 and 96.26 homologous to IgG4 CH3.

10 mL of ddCC49 supernatant was titrated with 1M Tris pH 9.0 to a final pH of 7.5. This material was filtered through a series of Sol Vac 0.8 and 0.4 membranes. A 100 mL XK50 Protein G column was pre equilibrated with 1 PBS at a flow rate of 80 ml min. The titrated filtered supernatant was loaded onto the column at 80 ml min. Bound protein was washed with the equilibrium buffer for 2.column volumes and then eluted with 100 mM Glycine at pH 3.0. The fractions containing the ddCC49 peak were collected and immediately titrated with 1 M Tris pH 9.0 to a final pH of 7.0.

A Toso Biosep Phenyl 5PW HR column was pre equilibrated with 20 mM Phosphate pH 7.2 1 M Ammonium Sulfate. The Protein G eluate was titrated to 1 M Ammonium Sulfate using a 3.5 M Ammonium Sulfate pH 7.2 stock and loaded at a concentration of 2 mg ml of gel bed. Bound protein was washed with a 20 mM Phosphate pH 4 or 7.2 Ammonium Sulfate to adjust the conductivity to 116.4 mS cm. The material eluted from this condition has an apparent molecular weight about 120 kD Form A on a non reducing SDS PAGE. The remaining bound antibody was further eluted with a linear gradient of reducing Ammonium Sulfate content in the Phosphate buffer. This method separates Forms A and B in two separate peaks. The latter eluted antibody apparently lacks the disulfide linkage between the heavy chains and its molecular weight is about 60 kDa Form B .

Both of the above purified materials can be recaptured by bringing the ammonium sulfate concentration to 1M and reloading it onto the cleaned Phenyl 5PW HR column. Bound protein is eluted with 20 mM Phosphate pH 7.2 and dialyzed into 1 PBS.

The biologic activity of Forms A and B as measured in preliminary experiments e.g. using direct binding or competition studies revealed that Forms A and B have similar biologic activity.

The stability of Forms A and B was also compared. Purified ddCC49 molecules were concentrated to about 5 mg ml by Amicon concentrator fitted with YM30 membrane Millipore . The concentrated materials were equally divided into four portions for each isoforms and each fraction was put into 10K dialysis cassette Pierce cat 66410 for 16 h dialysis in the following buffers 1 10 mM Sodium Phosphate pH3 2 10 mM Sodium acetate pH 5 3 10 mM Sodium Phosphate pH 7 and 4 10 mM Sodium Borate pH 9. After dialysis the protein concentration of each solution was adjusted to 3 mg ml. In addition to the pure A and B isoform solution a portion of A and B solutions from each pH were mixed to create a mixture containing 50 each isoform. Total of 12 formulations were created four pH levels times 3 antibody solutions . The solutions were filtered and filled in 3 ml Type 1 glass serum vials West Pharmaceuticals with gray butyl stopper.

Three temperatures 2 8 C. 20 25 C. and 38 42 C. were chosen to store the protein solutions for stability testing. Prior to storage 500 l samples were drawn from each formulation for physical and chemical analyses these zero time point data were referred to as control. Once in storage samples were drawn at the following schedule 2 weeks 1 month 2 months and 3 months and submitted for testing immediately.

To evaluate the physical and chemical stability of the two isoforms the following methods were used turbidity measured at OD non reducing SDS PAGE and size exclusion chromatography.

Non reducing SDS PAGE was performed on for samples stored at 2 8 C. 20 25 C. and 38 42 C. for various time points. Both A and B form are relatively stable at pH 5 when stored at 2 8 C. However when formulated at pH 7 and 9 both A and B forms showed degradation as indicated by increasing in number of bands that were smaller than the original major bands 120 kDa for form A and 60 kDa for form B . It was noticed that particularly for pH 7 and 9 samples stored at low and intermediate temperatures the intensity and number of bands that were less than 55 kDa were higher in B isoform than A. This indicated that under these conditions the A isoform is more stable than B isoform. However this seems not to be the case for A isoform in pH 5 and stored at 20 25 C. This sample seemed to have more fragments than B isoform. This appears to have been an artifact due to microbial contamination discussed in more detail below . At high storage temperature both forms at pH 9 were significantly degraded and there was almost no difference in gel patterns among the samples. Under this condition trace amount of smear bands showed up at top of the gel which indicated the formation of aggregates. Because aggregates could be dissolved by SDS the aggregation was investigated using the methods described in the following sections.

Table 4A through Table 4C list the turbidity data for ddCC49 stored at three different temperatures. The turbidity measures both the soluble and non soluble aggregates and it is based on the amount of light scattered by these particles. When present aggregates will scatter light and result in an increase in A. As showed in Table 4A C the turbidity of ddCC49 molecules stored at 2 8 C. increases as pH increased for both A and B isoforms with the former being less turbid than the latter. This trend held true for samples stored for less than a month at higher temperatures 20 25 C. and 38 40 C. . As storage time reached 3 months the turbidity increased significantly for samples at high pH and temperature and the difference between A and B forms diminished. These results parallel those of SDS PAGE and indicate that both isoforms are relatively stable in terms of not forming aggregates at pH 3 and 5 and that A isoform is less susceptible to aggregation than the B isoform.

Size exclusion chromatography SEC is a powerful method for revealing the percent of intact molecules and the degraded products both fragments and soluble aggregates and is highly reproducible. In Table 4A C the percent of intact monomer of A isoform B isoform and the mixture stored at different temperatures are listed. For samples stored at 2 8 C. it is clear that Form A has a higher percentage of monomer as compared to Form B and the mixture of Form A and Form B was somewhere in between. At this storage temperature both forms were relatively stable at pH 3 5 and 7 with pH 5 being the most stable condition for about three months. However at pH 9 there was a significant decrease in percentage of monomer for Form B but only a slight decrease for Form A.

At elevated temperatures all samples showed a significant decrease in percent of monomer as storage time increased the A isoform outperformed the B isoform. However there was an exception the sample of A isoform in pH 5 stored at room temperature exhibited much more degradation than the B isoform or the mixture under similar storage conditions. A close examination of this particular A isoform vial the data from SDS PAGE and SEC of the sample suggested that microbial contamination might have caused this unexpected result. First both the SEC and SDS PAGE results indicated that the degradation for this sample was primarily accounted for by a increase in fragmentation presumably resulting from microbial digestion otherwise some degree of increase in aggregation would have been expected. Second the fact that the mixture sample which contained 50 each of A and B isoform showed a better stability profile than B isoform indicating that a more stable A isoform must have contributed to the higher percent of monomer. Finally A isoform in pH 5 stored at 2 8 C. and 38 42 C. both showed higher percent of monomer than B isoform under similar conditions. Therefore intermediate storage temperature should have yielded similar results. Due to the limited amount of sample an assay for microbial contamination could not be performed.

It was also noted that for both isoforms of IDEC 159 stored in high pH 9 and at 40 C. the percent of monomer reduced to about 30 . Under these severe conditions the stability differences between the two isoforms disappeared. This SEC result mirrors of the results found using SDS PAGE. Both results indicate that although some chemical and physical characteristics differ between the two isoforms the mechanism and by products of degradation for both isoforms are similar if not identical.

In summary the SEC results indicate that both A and B isoforms have optimal pH at about 5 and that A isoform is more stable than B isoform in terms of retaining higher percent of intact monomer at similar storage conditions.

IDEC 159 ddCC49 is a CH2 domain deleted monoclonal antibody directed against TAG 72 antigen which is expressed on the surface of tumors. IDEC 159 contains two isoforms of the antibody called Form A and Form B. The current cell culture process for IDEC 159 produces an approximate 50 50 ratio of Form A to Form B. The Form A isoform is an antibody with a deleted CH2 region in the Fportion of the heavy chain. In addition to having a deleted CH2 region Form B also lacks the disulfide bond linkage across the Fregion and is only held together by hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges.

The third and final chromatography step in the IDEC 159 purification process was developed to separate the two isoforms of IDEC 159. The separation is achieved by hydrophobic interaction chromatography HIC using a Phenyl TSKgel 5PW HR adsorbent. Since form B is more hydrophobic than form A it adsorbs irreversibly to the stationary phase using approximately 0.73 M Ammonium Sulfate 20 mM Sodium Phosphate pH 4.0 pH 7.0 as the mobile phase. Form A binds to a lesser extent to the stationary phase under these conditions and is therefore eluted isocratically i.e. it leaves the column with the flowthrough fraction. Subsequent to the isocratic elution of Form A omitting Ammonium sulfate from the mobile phase desorbs Form B. The following method was used to separate the two isoforms of IDEC 159 

The separation of the two forms at a preparative scale 5L column volume total IDEC 159 load approximately 20 g was performed. The first two peaks comprised the isocratic elution of Form A the second peak comprised the eluted Form B while the third peak contains impurities which are removed from the stationary phase during cleaning.

The capability of this method to separate Forms A and B at preparative scale was also demonstrated by SDS PAGE.

A bispecific anti LTBR anti TRAILR2 CH2 domain deleted sc Fv 2 tetravalent antibody design was based on appending an anti LTBR single chain Fv scFv to the carboxyl terminus of the anti TRAILR2 CH2 domain deleted antibody CH3 domain. A schematic diagram of the tetravalent bispecific domain deleted antibody is shown in . An equivalent reference to this design is a C scFv Tetravalent CH2 Domain Deleted antibody.

The preparation of single polypeptide chain binding molecules of the Fv region i.e. single chain Fv molecules is described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778. Monoclonal anti LTD R antibody CBE11 has been described previously in PCT publication WO 96 22788 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 312 691 and humanized CBE11 has been described in WO 02 30986. The anti LTBR scFv is comprised of a VH and a VL region sequence tethered by a short synthetic linker VH Gly4Ser 3 SEQ ID NO 17 linker VL orientation and was synthesized by PCR amplification from plasmid DNA pXWO25 containing humanized anti LTBR scFv huCBE11 scFv in a pBluescript II SK vector. The 5 VH PCR primer included a Barn HI restriction endonuclease site followed by sequence encoding a Gly4Ser 2 SEQ ID NO 42 linker peptide. The 3 VL PCR primer included a stop codon followed by a Barn HI site. The scFv was amplified with the above PCR primer set and the gene fragment gel isolated digested with Barn HI restriction endonuclease and cloned into a single Barn HI site previously introduced into a CH2 domain deleted antibody expression vector containing a novel G1 G3 Pro243Ala244Pro245 Gly Ser hinge U.S. Ser. No. 10 880 320 . Briefly the vector was modified by removing an existing stop codon at the 3 end of the gene coding for the CH3 domain and replacing with nucleotides coding for the amino acid sequence Ser Gly Gly Gly SEQ ID NO 43 immediately followed by a Barn HI restriction endonuclease site coding for Gly Ser . The Barn HI digested scFv fragment was cloned into the Barn HI site of the vector and screened for correct scFv orientation resulting in a fusion product of the anti LTBR scFv to the carboxyl terminus of the CH2 domain deleted antibody CH3 domain through a 16 amino acid Ser GlySer SEQ ID NO 44 linker. Correct anti LTBR scFv sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.

The anti TRAIL R2 variable domains were amplified by PCR and subsequently introduced into the above described construct to introduce the Fab domains. The 5 VL anti TRAIL R2PCR primer included a Bgl II restriction endonuclease site and the 3 VL anti TRAIL R2PCR primer included a Bsi WI restriction endonuclease site. The murine VL region was amplified with the above set of PCR primers from the plasmid DNA substrate pEAG1678 containing the ch14A2 hu kappa light chain. The 5 VH anti TRAIL R2PCR primer included a Mlu I restriction endonuclease site followed by sequence encoding the 3 portion of the synthetic heavy leader and the 3 VH anti TRAIL R2 PCR primer included a Nhe I restriction endonuclease site for fusing to the CH1 domain. The murine VH region was amplified with the above set of PCR primers from the plasmid DNA substrate pEAG1678 containing the ch14A2 huIgG1 chain. Following amplification of the anti TRAIL R2 VL and VH regions the DNA fragments were gel isolated and ligated into the aforementioned vector. Correct sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.

The preparation of single polypeptide chain binding molecules of the Fv region single chain Fv molecules is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778. In order to facilitate fusion of the anti LTBR scFv to the amino terminus of the anti TRAIL R2 heavy chain variable domain a non coding Bgl II restriction endonuclease site upstream of the VL leader was first removed. This modification resulted in a unique Bgl II cloning site encompassing amino acid positions 18 20 ACC SEQ ID NO 19 of anti TRAIL R2 VH domain. The anti LTBR scFv is comprised of a VH and a VL region sequence tethered by a short synthetic linker VH Gly4Ser 3 SEQ ID NO 17 linker VL orientation and was synthesized by PCR amplification. The 5 VH PCR primer included a Mlu I restriction endonuclease site followed by sequence encoding three amino acids of synthetic heavy leader. The 3 VL PCR primers consisted of an internal reverse primer encoding a Gly4Ser 5 SEQ ID NO 45 linker and a second reverse primer encoding a partial anti TRAIL R2 VH region and a Bgl II site. The anti LTBR scFv Gly4Ser 5 SEQ ID NO 45 linker partial anti TRAIL R2 VH region was amplified in two sequential PCR reactions using the three aforementioned PCR primers through the common overlapping sequences encoding the GIy4Ser 5 SEQ ID NO 45 linker in plasmid DNA pXWO25 containing the huCBEl 1 scFv in a pBluescript II SK vector. The anti LTBR scFv Gly4Ser 5 1 SEQ ID NO 45 inker partial anti TRAIL R2 VH region gene fragment was gel isolated digested with Mlu I and Bgl II restriction endonucleases and cloned into the Mlu I Bgl II digested anti TRAIL R2 CH2 domain deleted vector containing the novel 1 G3 Pro243Ala244Pro245 Gly Ser hinge U.S. Ser. No. 10 880 320 resulting in a fusion product of the anti LTBR scFv to the amino terminus of the anti TRAILR2 CH2 domain deleted antibody VH domain through a 25 amino acid GIy4Ser 5 SEQ ID NO 45 linker. Correct sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.
