This application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 893 575 filed on Jun. 30 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 276 078 and entitled Paravalvular Leak Detection Sealing and Prevention which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

The present invention relates to implantable devices. More particularly it relates to the prevention detection and repair of paravalvular leaks around cardiac valve prostheses.

Cardiac valve implantation is well known in the art. Less well addressed is how to detect possible leaks between the valve and surrounding blood vessel how to seal such leaks or how to design the valve such that it automatically seals the leaks.

Machiraju in U.S. Pat. No. 5 554 184 entitled HEART VALVE describes a heart valve and a technique for effecting valve replacement or repair which partially or completely replaces the mitral or tricuspid valve with an autologous graft from the pericardium fascia lata or even the dura mater or a bovine or porcine pericardial or other synthetic sheet material equivalent thereof preferably in a configuration which substantially restores the original anato my of the heart including chordae tendineac attached to adjacent papillary muscles of the heart. Most preferably a section of the patient s pericardium is cut to a shape including two leaflets with each leaflet having a trabeculated tier of chordae tendineac terminating in a spear shaped tab. The two leaflets are cut out as a single unit and the two far ends are sutured together to yield a bileaflet valve having appended chordae and tabs.

Schreck in U.S. Pat. No. 6 454 799 entitled MINIMALLY INVASIVE HEART VALVES AND METHODS OF USE describes expandable heart valves for minimally invasive valve replacement surgeries. In a first embodiment an expandable pre assembled heart valve includes a plastically expandable annular base having a plurality of upstanding commissure posts. A tubular flexible member including a prosthetic section and a fabric section is provided with the prosthetic section being connected to the commissure posts and defining leaflets therebetween and the fabric section being attached to the annular base. In a second embodiment an expandable heart valve includes an annular tissue engaging base and a subassembly having an elastic wireform and a plurality of leaflets connected thereto. The annular base and subassembly are separately stored and connected just prior to delivery to the host annulus. Preferably the leaflet subassembly is stored in its relaxed configuration to avoid deformation of the leaflets. The expandable heart valves may be implanted using a balloon catheter. Preferably the leaflets of the heart valves are secured to the commissure regions of the expandable stents using a clamping arrangement to reduce stress.

Amplatz in U.S. Pat. No. 6 638 257 entitled INTRAVASCULAR FLOW RESTRICTOR describes an intravascular flow restrictor that comprises a braided tubular structure designed to be placed in the main pulmonary artery for limiting blood pressure in the lungs. The braided structure is designed to be collapsed for placement in a delivery catheter but when it is ejected from the delivery catheter it assumes a substantially larger diameter disk shaped device having one or more longitudinal channels or passways therethrough.

Amplatz also does not address leaks that can occur around the implanted valve. In addition Amplatz s braided structures are of a shape and size not appropriate for paravalvular leak detection and sealing Their geometry is designed for the conditions of the transceptal hole and not appropriate for valve leakage.

Spenser et al. in U.S. Patent Application No. 20030153974 entitled IMPLANTABLE PROSTHETIC VALVE describe a prosthesis device suitable for implantation in body ducts. The device comprises a support stent bring comprised of a deployable construction adapted to be initially crimped in a narrow configuration suitable for catheterization through a body duct to a target location and adapted to be deployed by exerting substantially radial forces from within by means of a deployment device to a deployed state in the target location the support stent bring provided with a plurality of longitudinally rigid support beams of fixed length and 2 a valve assembly comprising a flexible conduit having an inlet end and an outlet made of pliant material attached to the support beams providing collapsible slack portions of the conduit at the outlet. When flow is allowed to pass through the valve prosthesis device from the inlet to the outlet the valve assembly is kept in an open position whereas a reverse flow is prevented as the collapsible slack portions of the valve assembly collapse inwardly to provide blockage to the reverse flow.

With regard to the general topic of prosthetic valves implantation is currently done either through open heart surgery or by use of newer percutaneous methods some of which are described in the patents mentioned above. With both methods paravalvular leaks are a known side effect. One way to approach the leak problem is to identify the leak location and repair it. Another approach is to equip the prosthesis with means to prevent the leak self sealing prosthesis . Both these approaches are encompassed by the present invention.

Percutaneous introduction of medical devices is a preferred surgical procedure for it involves making only a very small perforation in the patient s skin usually in the groin or armpit area under local anesthetic sedation. In contrast surgical placement involves a large chest surgical incision and requires general anesthesia to expose a large portion of a patient s thoracic region. Percutaneous introduction is therefore considered safer and less invasive.

Percutaneous introduction of a leak detection and repair device or of a self sealing valve resembles other known interventional cardiologic procedures. The percutaneous deployment procedure and device has an impact on several parameters of the product design some of which are explained hereinafter.

The present invention provides methods and apparatuses for substantially reducing or effectively eliminating the deleterious effects of paravalvular leaks in prosthetic valves. More specifically it enables locating sealing and preventing paravalvular leaks using both dedicated and integrated with the valve means.

While the present invention is particularly suited for prosthetic heart valve leaks such as a prosthetic aortic valve it can also be applied to other leakage problems such as in other blood vessels a septum or other body lumens. Similarly while the prosthetic valve described herein is a tricuspid valve it could be another type of valve as well.

A main aspect of the present invention is the introduction of several novel designs and methods for locating paravalvular leaks in prosthetic valves.

Another main aspect of the present invention are several novel designs for sealing paravalvular leaks detected in prosthetic valves.

Another main aspect of the present invention are several novel designs for modifying percutaneous prosthetic valves to automatically seal paravalvular leaks when the valve is implanted.

Another main aspect of the present invention is a novel design that automatically seals paravalvular leaks when the valve is implanted without requiring valve modification.

Another main aspect of the present invention is the disclosure of several novel designs for modifying percutaneous prosthetic valves to enable sealing of paravalvular leaks after the valve is implanted.

For locating paravalvular leaks the present invention provides several designs comprising catheter delivered balloons mounted on flexible guidewires. The balloons are delivered to a point near the valve. When regurgitation leaking occurs during diastole the balloons are drawn into the leak producing cavities occurring between the valve and the wall of the blood vessel thereby providing a means to deliver means for sealing the leak.

For sealing paravalvular leaks the present invention provides several designs including sealing stents and multi component and radiation cured adhesive compounds.

Sealing stents are crimped stents that are delivered to the leak location expanded and anchored in place. The stents are designed to block flow thereby sealing the leak. Several innovations are provided for these operations.

Delivery of the sealing stent is via a guidewire that is anchored in the wall of the blood vessel at the leak location. The anchoring means can be a hook for example a multi headed hook composed of a shape memory alloy such as nickel titanium also known as nitinol which is crimped at low temperature for delivery. The anchoring means expands back to its original shape due to the higher temperature of the blood vessel at its deployment point thereby anchoring itself into the blood vessel wall.

Another anchoring means is for the guidewire to be terminated in a screw which can be threaded into the blood vessel wall.

Once delivered to the leak location via the guidewire the sealed stent is expanded. This can be done by another agent such as a balloon or by making the stent self expanding. In the case of balloon inflation the stent is crimped around the deflated balloon prior to insertion in the delivery catheter. Upon delivery the balloon is inflated thereby expanding the stent and then the balloons can be deflated and withdrawn. In the case of the self expanding stent the stent is preferably built from a shape memory alloy such as nickel titanium also known as nitinol which can be crimped at low temperature for delivery expanding back to its original shape due to the higher body temperature at the deployment site. Alternatively the self expanding stent can be a metallic stent comprised of a physiologically acceptable metal such as stainless steel or an alloy such as nitinol which is compressed or wound on a delivery catheter or device. When the stent is released from the delivery catheter or device it expands.

The sealing stent is held in place by friction. Additional holding force can be obtained by adding hooks around the perimeter of the stent such as self expanding hooks made of shape memory alloy.

The expanded stent includes an internal element that seals the stent s own lumen preventing flow through the stent and thereby sealing the cavity causing the leak. Examples of internal sealing elements include a spring hinged flap inside the stent lumen that opens upon stent expansion or in the case of the self expanding stent a membrane covering one or both openings of the stent.

In some cases it may be preferred to use two sealing stents. In this embodiment the two stents are connected in series by a suture. The delivery catheter is extended through the top of the cavity and out the bottom of the cavity to deploy one of the sealing stents and then together with the stents guide wire retracted. This pulls the deployed stent back until it catches in the bottom of the cavity. The catheter is further retracted and the second stent is deployed into the cavity. The catheter is further retracted and the second stent is pulled back catching it from the bottom in the top of the cavity.

An alternative sealing element to the sealing stent is a biological adhesive compound that can be delivered to the cavity via catheterization. In such a case two catheters are brought to the leak location. The catheters are used in one of the following ways to deliver two adhesive components that when mixed harden to form an adhesive sealing plug or to deliver a radiation cured adhesive and the cure source for example an ultra violet light source to produce an adhesive sealing plug.

In both sealing element designs there is a need to bring the distal catheter ends in close proximity to one another for proper mixing or curing at the leak point. This is accomplished as follows a first catheter is used to insert the leak detector guidewire mentioned above A second guidewire is fitted with a loop and the loop is run over the first guidewire until it reaches the leak location. The respective cathethers are then slid over their guidewires to meet at the leak location thereby providing egress for applying the bi component adhesive or radiation cured adhesive.

Another delivery design for a bi component adhesive utilizes a single catheter run over the leak detection guidewire. The catheter has three lumens one to track the guidewire and one for each adhesive component. A mixing means at the distal end of the catheter mixes the components at the leak location to form the sealing plug.

In other embodiments of the present invention leak sealing means are integrated into the valve as an impermeable ring that when the valve is implanted adaptively seals any gaps between the valve and the surrounding lumen.

In one embodiment of such a self sealing valve the ring is deflated for delivery and then inflated for sealing.

In another self sealing valve embodiment the ring is a sponge like material that is compressed for delivery and then expands for sealing.

In another self sealing valve embodiment the ring comprises a set of flaps that are closed for delivery and are opened either by balloon inflation by the geometry of their connection to the valve or by spring action.

In another self sealing valve embodiment the ring comprises struts of the valve s stent that are geometrically constrained to bend and enlarge their final diameter in respect to the main stent geometry when expanded from the crimped form

In another embodiment where sealing means are built into the valve a set of filament pairs are attached around the valve and feed back to the delivery catheter ingress. When a paravalvular leak is detected impermeable patches of a material such as pericardium are threaded onto the local filament pair and pushed down to the leak location where they are tied off in place.

In another embodiment of the present invention a sealing stent is first inserted into the lumen and then the valve is inserted inside the sealing stent.

The aforementioned embodiments as well as other embodiments manufacturing methods different designs and different types of devices are discussed with reference to the drawings. Note that the drawings are only given for the purpose of understanding the present invention and presenting some preferred embodiments of the present invention. The drawings are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.

A cavity exists between the perimeter of valve and aortic annulus . The cavity could have any number of causes including calcification or other irregularities in the aortic annulus that prevent proper sealing between the valve and the annulus . The cavity will cause regurgitation leaking during diastole characterized by blood flowing from the aorta into the left ventricle. Leak detector is delivered through catheter to a position above valve . Leak detector comprises a soft guide wire on which is mounted inflatable balloon which is inflated after leak detector has been passed through catheter . Guidewire is soft enough that during diastole inflated balloon is drawn into the regurgitation flow and lodges in cavity in between valve and annulus .

In one of the components of a biological bi component adhesive material is injected via catheter and the other component is injected via catheter . The liquid adhesive components meet at the catheter outlets at meeting point mixing to create the adhesive blocking element which repairs the paravalvular leak by closing cavity . depicts a top view of the final result of the repaired cavity showing that adhesive blocking element has been formed to seal cavity between valve and annulus .

Alternatively the sealing portion can be made of a material that on contact with a fluid soaks up the fluid and swells up. Once inserted into the body the sealing portion comes into contact with the blood causing it to swell and seal the cavity.

Inflating balloon as shown in anchors valve in annulus with sutures arranged around it. In cases where paravalvular cavities are present it is possible to repair them assisted by sutures . shows a patch made of pericardium or other suitable patch material inserted on sutures and pushed to the leaking cavity by means of a pushing catheter . After the patch is in place a knot or clip is used to secure it thereby repairing the leak .

The preceding specific embodiments are illustrative of the practice of the invention. It is to be understood however that other expedients known to those skilled in the art or disclosed herein may be employed without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims.
