title: MEMS mechanical initiator for a microdetonator
abstract: A MEMS mechanical initiator having a striker arm extending from a striker body. The tip of the striker arm is adjacent to, but does not touch, the side of a microdetonator. A cocking and release mechanism moves the striker body such that the striker arm pulls away from the side of the microdetonator against the action of a set of springs connected to the striker body. Thereafter the cocking and release mechanism releases the striker body such that the tip of the striker arm swipes the side of the microdetonator causing initiation thereof.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention in general relates to MEMS microelectromechanical systems fuzes and more particularly to a device for initiating a microdetonator in such fuze

A MEMS fuze uses a tiny microdetonator to initiate a charge sequence to detonate an explosive such as a munitions charge. A conventional method for mechanical initiation of conventional detonators typically uses stab pins. These stab pins however are much too large to integrate into a microdetonator fuze.

It is an object of the invention to provide a mechanical initiator that is small enough to initiate a microdetonator.

A MEMS mechanical initiator apparatus includes a microdetonator having a side. The apparatus includes a striker body having a striker arm extending therefrom. A tip of the striker arm is adjacent the side of the microdetonator prior to initiation. A set of anchored springs is connected to the striker body. A cocking and release mechanism is initially operable to withdraw the striker body such that the striker arm moves away from the side of the microdetonator against action of the springs. The cocking and release mechanism is thereafter operable to release the striker body such that the striker arm will be propelled by the springs to swipe the side of the microdetonator to cause detonation thereof by heat generated from viscoplastic deformation.

In the microdetonator is in an initial position insufficient to set off the secondary explosive . When the driver is engaged as indicated in it will move slider in the direction of arrow until the microdetonator is adjacent the mechanical initiator and directly above explosive lead whereupon the entire detonation process may proceed.

The mechanical initiator components are formed by a DRIE deep reactive ion etching process that removes unwanted portions of device layer . The DRIE process is a well developed micromachining process used extensively with silicon based MEMS devices. For this reason silicon is an exemplary material for the mechanical initiator apparatus of the present invention although other materials are possible.

The mechanical initiator apparatus of includes a striker arm the end of which is at a slight angle to and adjacent but not touching a side of a microdetonator . Striker arm extends from striker body at one side thereof while a trigger arm extends from an opposite side. Striker body is connected to spring sets and which in turn are connected to respective anchors and .

To operate as a MEMS mechanical initiator the arms and as well as striker body and spring sets and must be free to move and therefore must be free of any underlying silicon dioxide insulating layer . One way to accomplish the removal of the underlying insulating layer is by applying an etchant such as hydrofluoric acid that will dissolve the silicon dioxide. The etchant will in a relatively short period of time dissolve the insulation beneath the arms and as well as spring sets and as they are of small width thus freeing them for movement. To shorten the time for dissolving the silicon dioxide under the striker body the stricker body may be provided with a series of apertures which extend from the top surface down to the insulating layer thereby allowing the etchant direct access to the undersurface of the striker body . Although some of the etchant dissolves the insulation under the anchors and the process of freeing the other components is completed before the anchors are completely freed so that they remain immovable.

The mechanical initiator apparatus additionally includes a cocking and release mechanism connected to trigger arm . The cocking and release mechanism may be either be electrically actuated or environmentally actuated. An example of environmental actuation is the use of gun launch acceleration for cocking and target impact deceleration for release.

When activated and as illustrated in the cocking and release mechanism causes trigger arm to be withdrawn against the action of springs and and along with it the strikerbody and striker arm . When trigger arm is released by cocking and release mechanism as indicated in under action of springs and the tip of striker arm will swipe the side of microdetonator whereby the microdetonator is initiated by heat generated from viscoplastic deformation.

In the embodiment of microdetonator initiation is achieved by linear movement of striker arm . In the embodiment of initiation is achieved by rotational movement of a striker arm.

The mechanical initiator in includes a striker arm the end of which is at a slight angle to and adjacent but not touching a side of microdetonator . Striker arm extends from a relatively thin striker body a forward portion of the thin striker body which is connected to a curved spring having its other end connected to an anchor . A more distal portion of striker body in relation to the striker arm is connected to a second curved spring . The second curved spring having its other end connected to anchor . Cocking and release mechanism may be operative to act upon the distal end of striker body in a direction transverse thereto.

As seen in when cocking and release mechanism operates to push on distal end striker body and striker arm are rotated in a counterclockwise direction against the action of springs and . This action withdraws the end of striker arm from side of microdetonator . When cocking and release mechanism releases the distal end of striker body as illustrated in the striker body and striker arm are moved in a clockwise direction such that the tip of striker arm will swipe the side of microdetonator whereby the microdetonator is initiated by heat generated from viscoplastic deformation. It is evident that by reorienting the microdetonator the clockwise and counterclockwise directions for initiation may be reversed from that described.

There has been described a mechanical initiator which is much smaller than conventional stab detonators and can be made to interface with a microdetonator. Further the mechanical initiator may be fabricated using a MEMS process and can be directly incorporated into a MEMS fuze chip. It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
