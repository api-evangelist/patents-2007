The field of the invention relates generally to casino frequent player programs and more specifically to providing special incentives for remote entry of casino affiliation or membership cards.

Numerous organizations and companies have incentive programs for customers. For example airlines have frequent flyer programs that allow a member passenger to take free trips or provide other perks after the member has taken a minimum number of flights or has flown a minimum number of miles. Numerous other types of establishments including hotel chains chain stores and movie rental companies have similar programs used to incentivize a customer.

Casinos also often have similar frequent player programs that provide incentives for continued customer patronage. For instance the Foxwoods Casino Mashantucket Conn. offers a program referred to as Wampum Rewards. A player participating in the program receives a card which the player uses whenever he she comes to the casino. In one example implementation the player swipes the card at special kiosks located within the casino which permit that player to have a chance to win prizes. A Wampum Rewards member may also swipe his or her card whenever betting or spending money within the casino and in the associated hotel resort or shops. As the player bets or spends more money the player becomes eligible for free or reduced cost perks. Other examples of frequent player programs used in the casino environment include the well known Harrah s Total Rewards Wynn Casino s Red Card and Trump Casinos Trump Card programs.

As with frequent flyer programs and other types of incentive programs typical goals of the casino frequent player program include increasing player loyalty providing incentives to a player to visit the associated casinos as often as possible and encouraging the player to spend as much money in the associated establishments as possible.

The function and advantage of these and other embodiments of the present invention will be more fully understood from the examples described below. The following examples are intended to illustrate the benefits of the present invention but do not exemplify the full scope of the invention.

Frequent player programs for land based casinos require that players visit the land based casino or affiliated establishment to obtain credit. Therefore the player must decide to visit the land based casino based upon the rewards or incentives that the individual may obtain. However there is no actual additional pull for getting the player to visit the land based casino.

Additionally it is appreciated that constantly visiting a land based casino may be inconvenient for a bettor. However with the advent of Internet based betting sites and online casinos land based casinos are at a disadvantage to obtaining bettors that can have other betting opportunities that are more readily available.

One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for providing additional incentives to a frequent player program member to encourage them to visit a land based casino. One implementation combines the ease of using the Internet or other remote communication technologies with the advantages of a frequent player program. More particularly a frequent player program member may be provided an incentive to return to the casino in a more convenient location to the member e.g. at home on a cell phone . This additional incentive according to one embodiment may require the member to return to the casino to redeem the incentive. The incentive may for example be in the form of a prize credit or other incentive that has value to the member.

In one embodiment of the present invention each frequent player program member has a unique identifier e.g. an account number or an account name and a password or passcode. In another embodiment of the present invention the frequent player program member may be presented with special incentives for remotely swiping his or her frequent player program card or by remotely entering his or her unique identifier and password in a manner that the casino s frequent player program recognizes.

The special incentive may be any program that is targeted exclusively to members that remotely swipe or otherwise use their frequent player program cards. The special incentive program may include for example extra prizes or rewards that are awarded to frequent player program members when they remotely swipe or otherwise use their frequent player program card. In one embodiment of the invention the extra prizes or rewards are not provided to the member until he or she visits the land based casino. In another embodiment of the invention the member must visit the land based casino within a specified period of time to obtain the extra prizes or rewards. For instance the specified time period may be determined to be within a set time period of the membership card being swiped or within a set time period for the special incentive. For example a player may be required to visit a land based casino within one week or two months of having swiped his or her membership card. In another example the player may be required to visit the casino by a set date e.g. Feb. 28 2006 when the special incentive expires.

In another embodiment the player is encouraged to swipe or otherwise use their membership card remotely as frequently as possible. In one example implementation a system e.g. system may determine incentives periodically e.g. daily which are then displayed to the player. These incentives are displayed to the player as indication of a win in the display of a remote system. Because the incentives are determined in a periodic manner continued return by the player to the remote system interface is encouraged. For instance if the period for determining an incentive is once a day a player will be encouraged to use the remote system to see if they have won any incentive s . In this way both return to the casino and the remote interface is encouraged.

In another embodiment of the invention extra prizes or rewards may be won through a sweepstake. In one example the frequent player program member may be informed whether they won or lost at the time of entry. Preferably the member is not informed of their winnings until he or she visits the land based casino to encourage more members even losing ones to visit the land based casino.

In one implementation a computer system of a casino may automatically determine when a remote frequent player program member is a winner. Such a result may be automatically authenticated and verified by the computer system. In this instance the computer system may then notify the member that he or she has won and what the winnings are. Notification of winning to a member may occur for example by mail e mail Internet or other network telephone television pager fax kiosk or any other method. In one implementation the player may be advised of their winning during play of an online game. For instance during play of an online game in which winnings are displayed to the player the game program may be configured to reveal an indication of a win of an incentive. Displaying of the indication may occur for example within the game or the display may occur within play of another game e.g. a secondary game to the online game .

After a winner is authenticated and verified the computer system may then notify other members of the win. Additionally the computer system may display the member s identity and or payout.

A member may be able to remotely swipe their frequent player program card or otherwise enter his or her unique identifier and password using an audio enabled video enabled or card reader containing device. For instance a kiosk telephone having a display television computer or handheld device may be used. However it should be appreciated that any other entry method may be used e.g. by entering a member identifier manually into a computer system .
