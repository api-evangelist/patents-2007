Currently many health care related expenses are either directly tax deductible or can be paid with pre tax dollars using one or more health care expense account programs.

In many cases specific health care expenses are directly tax deductible. As one example typically if the accumulated health care expenses for a given year exceed a defined percentage of the employee s taxpayer s income the healthcare expenses are deductible. However to claim this deduction the employee taxpayer must keep track of all health care expenses and determine which healthcare expenses are considered legitimate health care expenses by the IRS or other government tax agency. For many employees taxpayers keeping track of these expenses is too burdensome and therefore valid tax deductions are never claimed because the employee taxpayer lacks the proper tracking and documentation and or does not consider the deduction worth the considerable effort needed to keep these records.

In addition to direct tax deductions health care expense account programs can also provide a taxpayer with tax relief for some health care expense. Currently many employers offer health care expense account programs in addition to traditional health care insurance. Herein health care expense account programs are defined as programs which provide an employee taxpayer and or employee taxpayer dependents a designated health care expense account that is assigned to the employee taxpayer and is used to reimburse the employee taxpayer for defined eligible health care expenses incurred by the employee taxpayer and or the employee s taxpayer s dependents. Examples of currently available health care expense account programs include but are not limited to flexible spending accounts FSAs health care reimbursement arrangements HRAs and health care spending accounts HSAs .

In many cases the health care expense account is a virtual account maintained by a health care expense program administrator or management service also called a program administrator either under the direct control of the employer or as a third party agent of the employer. In other cases the health care expense account is set up by the employees taxpayers themselves. Typically health care expense accounts are funded by either by the employee taxpayer and or the employer.

Health care expense account programs typically help the employee taxpayer pay health care expenses that are not covered by the employee s taxpayer s health care insurance such as deductibles the employee s taxpayer s portion of health care expenses co payments for doctors visits and prescriptions co payments for medical supplies and devices extended care and or home care and various other health care expenses determined to be eligible by the employer and or health care expense program administrator and or the IRS.

In typical operation funds are deposited in the health care expense account by the employee taxpayer the employer or a combination of both. Once the health care expense account is funded the funds are made available to reimburse the employee taxpayer for out of pocket expenses incurred by the employee taxpayer in eligible health care expense transactions. In most cases the employee taxpayer first pays the health care expense using his or her own funds. Then the employee taxpayer must identify the transaction provide documentation for the transaction and make a request to the program administrator for reimbursement of the funds.

The process above sounds simple enough and represents a genuine effort on the part of the government and employers to help employees taxpayers afford quality health care. However as noted above in reality the process of keeping track of numerous eligible health care expenses on a day to day transaction to transaction basis often becomes too burdensome for many employees taxpayers and in many cases the employee taxpayer simply chooses not to claim a healthcare expense deduction and or participate in the health care expense account program. This is especially true since in many cases individual eligible health care expenses are often only a few dollars such as a 10.00 co pay for a doctor visit or prescription. However in many cases large numbers of individual eligible health care expenses are incurred by the employee taxpayer and or the employee s taxpayer s dependents over the course of a year and these sums go unclaimed because the employee taxpayer does not recognize the cumulative effect of numerous relatively small payments over the course of a year. As a result well meaning deduction and reimbursement programs intended as benefits come to be viewed by the employee taxpayer as burdensome at best and often as simply irrelevant. This fact serves neither the employee taxpayer nor the employer s government s best interests.

In accordance with one embodiment a method and system for eligible health care expense identification includes a process for eligible health care expense identification whereby electronic data including data representing health care expense transactions over a defined time frame is collected. The electronic data is then analyzed and health care expense transactions that are potentially eligible for reimbursement from a health care expense account are identified. The identified health care expense transactions are then verified as eligible health care expense transactions based on the electronic data collected and or known programmed rules defining eligible health care expenses.

In one embodiment the electronic data including data representing health care expense transactions is collected from electronic transaction data maintained by banks and or other financial institutions. In one embodiment the electronic data including data representing health care expense transactions is collected from electronic transaction data maintained by credit account providers such as credit card companies.

In one embodiment the electronic data including data representing health care expense transactions is collected by interfacing with a computing system implemented process such as but not limited too a computing system implemented personal financial management system a computing system implemented personal accounting system and or a computing system implemented healthcare expense management system.

In one embodiment the electronic data including data representing health care expense transactions is collected from electronically transferred Explanation of Benefits EOB data provided by health insurance providers.

In one embodiment the electronic data including data representing health care expense transactions is collected from any combination of the above sources and or from any other source of electronic data including data representing health care expense transactions whether known at the time of filing or as developed thereafter.

In one embodiment once the electronic data is collected the data is then analyzed and compared with using known eligibility rules to identify potentially eligible health care expense transactions.

In one embodiment electronic transaction data maintained by banks and or credit account providers is obtained and analyzed using the known eligibility rules to identify potential health care expense transactions and based on an assigned category of transaction and or the merchant paid through the transaction and the known programmed rules for eligible health care expenses. In one embodiment the electronic transaction data maintained by banks and or credit account providers is analyzed to identify potential health care expense transactions and or verify the eligible health care expense transactions based on level 3 transaction data identifying specific items purchased the provider of such items the date of purchase the price paid by the employee and the known programmed rules for eligible health care expenses. In one embodiment the electronic receipts provided by suppliers of medications and or medical devices supplies such as drug stores pharmacies medical supply companies etc. are obtained and analyzed to identify potential health care expense transactions. In one embodiment the health care expense transactions are then verified based on receipt data identifying specific items purchased the date of purchase the provider of such items the price paid by the employee and the known programmed rules for eligible health care expenses.

In one embodiment the electronic data including data representing health care expense transactions is analyzed and eligible health care expense transactions are identified by any combination of the methods described above and or any other method of scanning and or analyzing electronic data to identify eligible health care expense transactions whether known at the time of filing or as developed thereafter.

In one embodiment eligible health care expense transactions are further verified by checking the subject matter and or purchase items associated with the health care expense transactions against a listing of eligible or non eligible health care expenses. In one embodiment the listing of eligible or non eligible health care expenses is provided by the employer and or program administrator and or a government tax agency.

In one embodiment once the electronic transaction data is obtained and analyzed to identify potentially eligible health care expense transactions the user is then notified of these potentially eligible health care expense transactions.

In one embodiment eligible health care expense transactions are also identified and or authorized by the employee. In this embodiment the employee is provided a listing of potentially eligible health care expense transactions. The employee is then provided an opportunity to edit the list and or remove specific potentially eligible health care expense transactions from the listing prior to submission to the program administrator for reimbursement and or claiming a tax deduction.

Using the method and system for eligible health care expense identification disclosed herein an employee s taxpayer s financial transaction records for a defined period are automatically analyzed in light of known eligibility rules and potentially deductible and or eligible health care expense transactions are automatically identified for the employee taxpayer. As a result the employee taxpayer is to a large extent relieved of the burden of identifying and tracking individual health care expenses. Consequently the employee taxpayer is more likely to use the health care expense deduction program and receive the full intended benefit of these programs.

In one embodiment in addition to analyzing current transactions i.e. transactions from the current tax program year the method and system for eligible health care expense identification disclosed herein can be used to analyze historical transactions i.e. transactions from previous tax program years. In this way the method and system for eligible health care expense identification disclosed herein can be used to identify potentially deductible and or eligible health care expense transactions that were either ignored and or forfeited in the past and in some cases can be claimed via an amended tax return or retroactive benefit claim. In addition the historical transaction data can be used to more accurately determine how many pre tax dollars should be placed in a health care expense account program and or determine future tax liabilities. Consequently using one embodiment of the method and system for eligible health care expense identification disclosed herein the employee taxpayer can at a minimum be made aware of the potential tax benefits he or she is forfeiting thereby allowing the employee taxpayer to at least make an informed decision as whether or not to take a deduction and or participate in a health care expense program.

In one embodiment once the electronic data including data representing health care expense transactions is accessed collected at ACCESS ELECTRONIC DATA INCLUDING DATA REPRESENTING HEALTH CARE EXPENSE TRANSACTIONS FOR THE DEFINED TIME FRAME OPERATION process flow proceeds to OBTAIN ELIGIBILITY RULES RESTRICTIONS FROM HEALTH CARE EXPENSE ACCOUNT PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR AND OR TAX AGENCY OPERATION .

In one embodiment at OBTAIN ELIGIBILITY RULES RESTRICTIONS FROM HEALTH CARE EXPENSE ACCOUNT PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR AND OR TAX AGENCY OPERATION rules and or requirements defining eligible health care expenses are obtained from any source including but not limited to an employer providing a health care expense account program a health care expense account program administrator statue a government agency a private agency any public or private third party agencies and or institutions or any other source of health care expense account eligibility rules and or federal state or local tax laws rules.

In one embodiment the rules and or requirements defining eligible health care expenses are dictated by federal state or local tax and or regulatory statutes. As discussed above in many cases specific health care expenses are directly tax deductible. As one example if the accumulated health care expenses for a given year exceed a defined percentage of the employee s taxpayer s income the healthcare expenses are often deductible. However to claim this deduction the employee taxpayer must keep track of all health care expenses and determine which healthcare expenses are considered legitimate health care expenses by the IRS or other government tax agency. In these cases the rules and or requirements defining eligible health care expenses are dictated by federal state and or local tax statute and the rules provided at OBTAIN ELIGIBILITY RULES RESTRICTIONS FROM HEALTH CARE EXPENSE ACCOUNT PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR AND OR TAX AGENCY OPERATION would include any threshold percentages along with a listing or guideline of typically eligible health care expenses and or a specific listing of eligible health care expenses.

As also discussed above in many instances an employer offers a health care expense account program to the employee. As noted above health care expense account programs are defined as programs which provide an employee and or employee dependents a designated health care expense account that is assigned to the employee and is used to reimburse the employee for defined eligible health care expenses.

As also noted above in many cases the health care expense account is a virtual account maintained by a health care expense program administrator or management service also called a program administrator either under the direct control of the employer or as a third party agent of the employer. In other cases the health care expense account is set up by the employees themselves. Typically health care expense accounts are funded by either the employee and or the employer using pre tax dollars.

As discussed above health care expense account programs typically are designed to help the employee pay health care expenses that are not covered by the employee s health care insurance. Examples of health care expenses that are typically eligible for reimbursement under a health care expense account program include but are not limited to health care insurance deductibles the employee s portion of health care expenses co payments for doctors visits and prescriptions co payments for medical supplies and devices extended care and or home care and various other health care expenses determined to be eligible by the employer and or health care expense program administrator.

In operation funds are typically deposited in the health care expense account by the employee the employer or a combination of both. Once the health care expense account is funded the funds are made available to reimburse the employee for out of pocket expenses incurred by the employee in eligible health care expense transactions. In most cases the employee first pays the health care expense using his or her own funds. Then the employee makes a request to a program administrator for reimbursement of the funds. The employee is then reimbursed for his or her out of pocket expenses from the health care expense account.

Examples of common health care expense account programs currently available include but are not limited to flexible spending accounts FSAs health care reimbursement arrangements HRAs and health care spending accounts HSAs . Each of these health care expense account programs operate to reimburse the employee for out of pocket expenses incurred by the employee in eligible health care expense transactions. However the funding lifespan and portability of these three programs vary.

For instance in a typical flexible spending account FSA program the employee must elect to deposit a specified pre tax dollar amount in the health care expense account i.e. the FSA to cover health care expenses that will occur over a predefined future period. For instance as one example the employee must elect to deposit a pre tax dollar amount specified by the employee to be paid into the health care expense account for pre tax reimbursement of all eligible health care expenses to be incurred in the next 12 months. In many cases the amount specified by the employee is paid by deducting a portion of the specified amount from the employee s compensation over multiple pay periods. In other cases the employer makes contributions to the FSA and the employer deposits funds in the health care expense account on a periodic basis.

Using a typical FSA it is important that an employee predict his or her total eligible health care expenses fairly accurately. This is because any funds not used to reimburse the employee for a transaction occurring within the predefined period i.e. unused funds are typically forfeited. Consequently an underestimate of the employee s total eligible health care expenses results in real post tax expense while an overestimate of the total eligible health care expenses results in forfeited pre tax money. FSAs are the most common form of health care expense account programs. Given the forfeiture feature of the typical FSA timely and accurate submission of reimbursement requests is critical.

A typical health care reimbursement arrangement HRA is very similar to an FSA except that the HRA account is typically funded by the employer and in many cases the health care expense account balance remains for employee to use as long as the employee is employed by the employer.

Health care spending accounts HSAs are a federal program whereby a user and or employer funds the health care spending account themselves with pre tax dollars. The user then reimburses himself or herself from the account for eligible health care expenses. A health care spending account remains the property of the user for life. However funds drawn from the health care spending account prior to the defined retirement age must be identified accounted for and verified through special tax documentation.

Each of the health care expense account programs discussed above includes specific eligibility rules that in one embodiment are obtained at OBTAIN ELIGIBILITY RULES RESTRICTIONS FROM HEALTH CARE EXPENSE ACCOUNT PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR AND OR TAX AGENCY OPERATION .

In addition in one embodiment an itemized listing of eligible or non eligible health care expenses is provided to process for eligible health care expense identification by the employer and or program administrator and or tax agency at OBTAIN ELIGIBILITY RULES RESTRICTIONS FROM HEALTH CARE EXPENSE ACCOUNT PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR AND OR TAX AGENCY OPERATION .

Returning to in these embodiments the data representing the identified potentially eligible health care expense transactions is made available to the user or the user s agent by granting the user s and or the user agent s computing system access to the data and or providing the data on a computer program product.

In other embodiments data representing the identified potentially eligible health care expense transactions is provided to the user or the user s agent through a network of computing systems and or server systems that is comprised of multiple different computers wireless devices cellular telephones digital telephones two way pagers personal digital assistants server computers or any desired combination of these devices that are interconnected using a network such as network of . As discussed above network can be any network or network system that is of interest to a user such as a Local Area Network LAN a Wide Area Network WAN a public network such as the Internet a private network a combination of network types or other network capable of allowing communication between two or more computing systems whether available or known at the time of filing or as later developed.

Returning to in other embodiments the data representing the identified potentially eligible health care expense transactions is made available to the user or user agent through e mail or through text messaging. In other embodiments the data representing the identified potentially eligible health care expense transactions is made available to the user or user agent through any method apparatus process or mechanism for transferring data and or text from one or more devices computing systems server systems databases web site web functions and or any devices having a data storage capability to one or more other devices computing systems server systems databases web site web functions and or any devices having a data storage capability whether known at the time of filing or as thereafter developed.

In one embodiment the data representing the identified potentially eligible health care expense transactions is made available to the user or user agent by automatically transferring the data to a user s or user agent s computing system and or storage device by any of the methods and or mechanisms discussed herein.

In one embodiment once the data representing the identified potentially eligible health care expense transactions is transferred to the user or user agent process flow proceeds to EXIT OPERATION and process for eligible health care expense identification returns to DEFINE A TIME FRAME FOR TRANSACTION ANALYSIS OPERATION to await the next cycle.

Using process for eligible health care expense identification an employee s taxpayer s financial transaction records and or data for a defined period are automatically analyzed in light of known eligibility rules and potentially deductible and or eligible health care expense transactions are automatically identified for the employee taxpayer. As a result using process for eligible health care expense identification the employee taxpayer is to a large extent relieved of the burden of identifying and tracking individual health care expenses. Consequently the employee taxpayer is more likely to use the health care expense deduction program and receive the full intended benefit of these programs.

In addition in one embodiment process for eligible health care expense identification can be used to analyze historical transactions i.e. transactions from previous tax program years. In this way process for eligible health care expense identification can be used to identify potentially deductible and or eligible health care expense transactions that were either ignored and or forfeited in the past and in some cases can be claimed via an amended tax return or retroactive benefit claim. Consequently using process for eligible health care expense identification the employee taxpayer can at a minimum be made aware of the potential tax benefits he or she is forfeiting thereby allowing the employee taxpayer to at least make an informed decision as whether or not to take a deduction and or participate in a health care expense program.

In addition as discussed above using many health care spending accounts such as an FSA it is important that an employee predict his or her total eligible health care expenses fairly accurately. This is because any funds not used to reimburse the employee for a transaction occurring within the predefined period i.e. unused funds are typically forfeited. Using process for eligible health care expense identification and the historical transaction scan feature a user can more accurately determine how many pre tax dollars should be placed in a health care expense account program such as an FSA or HRA account and or determine future tax liabilities.

As discussed in more detail above using the above embodiments with little or no modification and or user input there is considerable flexibility adaptability and opportunity for customization to meet the specific needs of various users under numerous circumstances.
