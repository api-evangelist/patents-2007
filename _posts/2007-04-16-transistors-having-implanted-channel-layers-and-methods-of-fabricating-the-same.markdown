This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 814 516 filed Jun. 16 2006 entitled TRANSISTORS HAVING IMPLANTED CHANNEL LAYERS AND METHODS OF FABRICATING THE SAME the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. This application is related to co pending and commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 11 700 268 entitled TRANSISTORS HAVING IMPLANTED CHANNELS AND IMPLANTED P TYPE REGIONS BENEATH THE SOURCE REGION AND METHODS OF FABRICATING THE SAME filed Jan. 1 2007.

The present invention was made at least in part with support from The Office of Naval Research contract number N00014 02 C 0250. The Government may have certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to microelectronic devices and more particularly to transistors for example metal semiconductor field effect transistors MESFETs .

Electrical circuits requiring high power handling capability 20 watts while operating at high frequencies such as radio frequencies 500 MHz S band 3 GHz and X band 10 GHz have in recent years become more prevalent. Because of the increased interest in high power high frequency circuits there has been a corresponding increase in demand for transistors that are capable of reliably operating at radio frequencies and above while still being capable of handling higher power loads. Previously bipolar transistors and power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors MOSFETs have been used for high power applications but the power handling capability of such devices may be limited at higher operating frequencies. Junction field effect transistors JFETs have been used for high frequency applications but the power handling capability of previously known JFETs may also be limited.

Recently metal semiconductor field effect transistors MESFETs have been developed for high frequency applications. The MESFET construction may be preferable for high frequency applications because only majority carriers carry current. The MESFET design may be preferred over current MOSFET designs because the reduced gate capacitance permits faster switching times of the gate input. Therefore although all field effect transistors utilize majority carriers to carry current the Schottky gate structure of the MESFET may make the MESFET more desirable for high frequency applications.

In addition to the type of structure and perhaps more fundamentally the characteristics of the semiconductor material from which a transistor is formed also affect the operating parameters. Of the characteristics that affect a transistors operating parameters the electron mobility saturated electron drift velocity electric breakdown field and thermal conductivity may have the greatest effect on a transistor s high frequency and high power operational characteristics.

Electron mobility is the measurement of how rapidly an electron is accelerated to its saturated velocity in the presence of an electric field. In the past semiconductor materials which have a high electron mobility were preferred because more current could be developed with a smaller field resulting in faster response times when a field is applied. Saturated electron drift velocity is the maximum velocity that an electron can obtain in the semiconductor material. Materials with higher saturated electron drift velocities are preferred for high frequency applications because the higher velocity translates to shorter transit times from source to drain.

Electric breakdown field is the field strength at which breakdown of the Schottky junction occurs and the current through the gate of the device suddenly increases. A high electric breakdown field material is preferred for high power high frequency transistors because larger electric fields generally can be supported by a given dimension of material. Larger electric fields allow for faster transients as the electrons can be accelerated more quickly by larger electric fields than by smaller fields.

Thermal conductivity is the ability of the semiconductor material to dissipate heat. In typical operations all transistors generate heat. In turn high power and high frequency transistors usually generate larger amounts of heat than small signal transistors. As the temperature of the semiconductor material increases the junction leakage currents generally increase and the current through the field effect transistor generally decreases due to a decrease in carrier mobility with an increase in temperature. Therefore if the heat is dissipated from the semiconductor the material will remain at a lower temperature and be capable of carrying larger currents with lower leakage currents.

In the past high frequency MESFETs have been manufactured of n type III V compounds such as gallium arsenide GaAs because of their high electron mobilities. Although these devices provided increased operating frequencies and moderately increased power handling capability the relatively low breakdown voltage and the lower thermal conductivity of these materials have limited their usefulness in high power applications.

Silicon carbide SiC has been known for many years to have excellent physical and electronic properties which should theoretically allow production of electronic devices that can operate at higher temperatures higher power levels and higher frequencies than devices produced from silicon Si or GaAs. The high electric breakdown field of about 4 10V cm high saturated electron drift velocity of about 2 10cm sec and high thermal conductivity of about 4.9 W cm K indicate that SiC would be suitable for high frequency high power applications. Unfortunately difficulty in manufacturing has limited the usefulness of SiC for high power and high frequency applications.

MESFETs having channel layers of silicon carbide have been produced on silicon substrates See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 762 806 to Suzuki et al. and 4 757 028 to Kondoh et al. . Because the semiconductor layers of a MESFET may be epitaxial the layer upon which each epitaxial layer is grown affects the characteristics of the device. Thus a SiC epitaxial layer grown on a Si substrate generally has different electrical and thermal characteristics then a SiC epitaxial layer grown on a different substrate. Although the SiC on Si substrate devices described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 762 806 and 4 757 028 may have exhibited improved thermal characteristics the use of a Si substrate generally limits the ability of such devices to dissipate heat. Furthermore the growth of SiC on Si generally results in defects in the epitaxial layers that result in high leakage current when the device is in operation.

Other MESFETs have been developed using SiC substrates. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07 540 488 filed Jun. 19 1990 and now abandoned the disclosure of which is incorporated entirely herein by reference describes a SiC MESFET having epitaxial layers of SiC grown on a SiC substrate. These devices exhibited improved thermal characteristics over previous devices because of the improved crystal quality of the epitaxial layers grown on SiC substrates. However to obtain high power and high frequency it may be necessary to overcome the limitations of SiC s lower electron mobility.

Similarly commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5 270 554 to Palmour describes a SiC MESFET having source and drain contacts formed on n regions of SiC and an optional lightly doped epitaxial layer between the substrate and the n type layer in which the channel is formed. U.S. Pat. No. 5 925 895 to Sriram et al. also describes a SiC MESFET and a structure that is described as overcoming surface effects which may reduce the performance of the MESFET for high frequency operation. Sriram et al. also describes SiC MESFETs which use n source and drain contact regions as well as a p type buffer layer.

Furthermore conventional SiC FET structures may provide nearly constant operating characteristics during the entire operating range of the FET. i.e. from fully open channel to near pinch off voltage by using a very thin highly doped channel a delta doped channel offset from the gate by a lightly doped region of similar conductivity type. Delta doped channels are discussed in detail in an article by Yokogawa et al. entitled MRS Fall Symposium 2000 and an article by Konstantinov et al. entitled MRS Fall Symposium 2000.

However one potential problem associated with conventional SiC MESFET designs is that it may be difficult to control the thickness doping and or conductivity of the epitaxially grown channel layers. Because of variations in such properties it may be difficult to reliably fabricate devices having consistent operating characteristics.

Some embodiments of the invention provide a metal semiconductor field effect transistor including a silicon carbide layer spaced apart source and drain regions in the silicon carbide layer a channel region positioned beneath a surface of the silicon carbide layer between the source and drain regions and doped with implanted dopants and a gate contact on the silicon carbide layer.

The transistor may further include a recess in the silicon carbide layer and the gate contact may be positioned in the recess. The recess may extend into the silicon carbide layer by about 600 . Furthermore the recess may extend into the channel region.

The channel region may have a concentration of implanted dopants of 1 10cmor more. For example the channel region may further have a peak concentration of implanted dopants in a range of from about 3 10cmto about 2 10cm. The peak concentration may be located in a range of from about 100 nm to about 350 nm from a surface of the silicon carbide layer.

The transistor may further include a cap layer on the channel layer and the gate contact may extend through the cap layer to the silicon carbide layer.

The channel region may include a concentration profile of implanted dopants including multiple implant peaks. For example the implanted dopants may form a dual peak dopant profile in the channel layer.

The channel region may include a first sublayer a second sublayer and a third sublayer disposed between the first and second sublayers. The third sublayer may have a dopant concentration less than a dopant concentration of the first sublayer and or the second sublayer. The gate contact may extend through the first sublayer and into the third sublayer.

In some embodiments the channel region may include a first sublayer having a first dopant concentration and a second sublayer having a second dopant concentration beneath the first sublayer. The first sublayer may have a higher dopant concentration than the second sublayer. The gate contact may extend into the first sublayer.

The silicon carbide layer may have a thickness of from about 0.5 to about 0.8 m and may include an unintentionally doped silicon carbide layer. The silicon carbide layer may include an epitaxial silicon carbide layer and or a bulk silicon carbide layer. In particular the bulk silicon carbide layer may include a semi insulating silicon carbide substrate.

The channel region may have a mobility in a range of about 100 cmV s to about 240 cm V s an implant charge density in a range of about 3 10cmto about 2 10cm a peak doping in the range of about 3 10cmto about 2 10cmand or a sheet resistivity in a range of about 4000 ohms square to about 7500 ohms square.

Methods of forming a metal semiconductor field effect transistor according to some embodiments of the invention include providing a layer of silicon carbide forming spaced apart source and drain regions in the silicon carbide layer implanting impurity atoms to form a channel region beneath a surface of the silicon carbide layer between the source and drain regions annealing the implanted impurity atoms and forming a gate contact on the silicon carbide layer.

Implanting impurity atoms may be performed at a temperature above room temperature. For example implanting impurity atoms may be performed at a temperature of at least about 1100 C.

Annealing the implanted impurity atoms may be performed at a temperature of at least about 1400 C. For example annealing the implanted impurity atoms may be performed at a temperature of from about 1400 C. to about 1700 C. In particular annealing the implanted impurity atoms may be performed at a temperature of about 1600 C. Moreover annealing the implanted impurity atoms may be performed for about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes.

The methods may further include forming a recess in the silicon carbide layer forming the gate contact may include forming the gate contact in the recess.

The methods may further include forming a cap layer on the silicon carbide layer and forming a recess through the cap layer and forming the gate contact may include forming the gate contact in the recess. The methods may further include forming a second recess in the silicon carbide layer and forming the gate contact may include forming the gate contact in the second recess.

The layer of silicon carbide may include an unintentionally doped layer of epitaxial silicon carbide and or a bulk silicon carbide layer. In particular the bulk silicon carbide layer may include a semi insulating silicon carbide substrate.

The present invention will now be described with reference to the which illustrate various embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated in the Figures the sizes of layers or regions are exaggerated for illustrative purposes and thus are provided to illustrate the general structures of the present invention. Furthermore various aspects of the present invention are described with reference to a layer being formed on a substrate or other layer. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art references to a layer being formed on another layer or substrate contemplates that additional layers may intervene. References to a layer being formed on another layer or substrate without an intervening layer are described herein as being formed directly on the layer or substrate. Furthermore relative terms such as beneath may be used herein to describe one layer or regions relationship to another layer or region as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example if the device in the Figures is turned over layers or regions described as beneath other layers or regions would now be oriented above these other layers or regions. The term beneath is intended to encompass both above and beneath in this situation. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

It will be understood that although the terms first and second are used herein to describe various regions layers and or sections these regions layers and or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one region layer or section from another region layer or section. Thus a first region layer or section discussed below could be termed a second region layer or section and similarly a second region layer or section may be termed a first region layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.

Transistors according to embodiments of the present invention may be useful in for example high efficiency linear power amplifiers such as power amplifiers for base stations using complex modulation schemes such as code division multiple access CDMA and or Wideband CDMA W CDMA .

Referring to transistors for example metal semiconductor field effect transistors MESFETs according to some embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail. As seen in a substrate is provided. The substrate may be a single crystal bulk silicon carbide SiC substrate of either p type or n type conductivity or semi insulating. The substrate of either p type or n type may be very lightly doped. The substrate may be formed of silicon carbide having a polytype selected from the group of 6H 4H 15R or 3C silicon carbide. Although the present invention is described herein with reference to a SiC substrate the present invention is not limited to SiC. For example in some embodiments the substrate may also include for example gallium arsenide GaAs and or Gallium Nitride GaN . Moreover devices according to some embodiments of the invention may not have a substrate. For example some devices may include semiconductor layers removed from a growth substrate and mounted to a carrier substrate and or a submount.

An optional buffer layer of for example p type silicon carbide may be provided on the substrate . The buffer layer may be formed of p type conductivity silicon carbide of 6H 4H 15R or 3C polytype. The buffer layer may for example have a carrier concentration of from about 2 10cmto about 6 10cm. Suitable dopants include aluminum boron and or gallium. The buffer layer may have a thickness of about 2 m. Although the buffer layer is described above as p type silicon carbide the invention is not limited to this configuration. Alternatively the buffer layer may be undoped silicon carbide i.e. unintentionally doped or very low doped n type conductivity silicon carbide. If a very low doped n type silicon carbide is utilized for the buffer layer the carrier concentration of the buffer layer is preferably less than about 5 10cm.

The buffer layer may be disposed between the substrate and a second buffer layer . The second buffer layer may be for example p type silicon carbide having a carrier concentration of from about 1 10cmto about 5 10cm but typically about 1.5 10cm. The p type silicon carbide buffer layer may also have a thickness of from about 0.5 m or less to about 1 m. Although the second buffer layer is described above as being of p type conductivity silicon carbide it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to this configuration. Alternatively for example the second buffer layer may be of n type conductivity for example very lightly doped n type conductivity SiC or undoped SiC as discussed above with respect to the buffer layer . In some embodiments of the present invention the second buffer layer may be provided directly on the substrate . A channel layer is provided on the second buffer layer as illustrated in . The channel layer may be formed of silicon carbide having a 6H 4H 15R or 3C polytype and may be undoped and or unintentionally doped. As used herein unintentionally doped means that dopant atoms are not intentionally introduced into the layer during growth. However some background dopant impurities may be present in the layer.

After formation of the channel layer n type impurity atoms such as nitrogen and or phosphorus are implanted into the channel layer to form an implanted channel region therein. The implanted channel region may have a dopant concentration greater than about 1 10cm and may have a peak dopant concentration in a range of from about 3 10cmto about 2 10cm. In particular embodiments the implanted channel region may have a peak dopant concentration of about 1 10cm. The implanted channel region may have a thickness of from about 50 nm to about 300 nm. In particular embodiments the implanted channel region has a thickness of about 100 nm. The peak concentration of implanted dopant atoms may be located about 60 nm to 200 nm from the surface of the channel layer . In particular embodiments the peak concentration of implanted dopant atoms may be located about 150 nm from the surface of the channel layer .

Conventionally implanted channel layers have not been used in SiC MESFETs because of the reduced carrier mobility resulting from damage to the semiconductor lattice caused by the implantation process. However embodiments of the present invention may employ a low damage implant process to form implanted channel regions having acceptable mobility sheet resistance and or other properties.

Since the channel region of a device according to some embodiments of the invention is implanted many different dopant profiles can be accurately and repeatably created within the channel layer . Accordingly operational properties of MESFET devices according to some embodiments of the invention may be more accurately controlled and or engineered compared to conventional MESFET structures in which the channel region is doped during epitaxial growth.

For example delta doping of channels may be accomplished more accurately and reliably according to some embodiments of the invention. Furthermore in some embodiments according to the invention the implanted channel region may have a dual peak configuration. That is the implanted channel region may include a pair of dopant concentration peaks formed in multiple implant steps and spaced apart from one another to provide a channel region having first second and third sub layers similar to the structure described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 136 456 to Sriram the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. In brief the more highly doped regions near the concentration peaks may act as carrier supply regions for the central region of relatively low dopant concentration between the two dopant peaks. The central region may have increased mobility compared to the more highly doped regions which may result in improved device performance.

Ion implantation is a well known method of doping a semiconductor layer with impurities. Ion implantation is useful for selective doping of crystalline material in order to form desired regions in the material such as p n junctions highly conductive contact regions field spreading regions etc. In an ion implantation process ionized impurity atoms are accelerated through an electric field towards a target layer where they become embedded. The number of ions directed at a target layer is referred to as the dose which is typically expressed in ions cm. The ions are accelerated at an energy level typically expressed in electron volts eV . The distribution of ions in the implanted layer depends on the dose and energy of the implant sometimes referred to as the implant conditions as well as the type of ions implanted the type of material the ions are implanted into the angle of the implants and other factors. In each implant step the implanted ions typically form a concentration distribution that has a peak concentration at a particular depth i.e. the implant range . Multiple implant steps may be performed using different implant conditions to build up a desired dopant concentration profile.

Typically after impurities are implanted into a semiconductor layer it is desirable to anneal the implanted impurities at a high temperature i.e. a so called activation anneal. An activation anneal may repair damage caused by the implantation of high energy ions into the semiconductor lattice. Implant damage may include for example broken and or rearranged chemical bonds within the semiconductor lattice. The activation anneal may also assist implanted impurity ions in finding a suitable site in the crystal lattice at which the ions may appropriately act as acceptors and or donors.

In some embodiments of the invention implantation of ions to form implanted channel region may be performed at relatively low implant energies and or doses and or at relatively high temperatures in order to provide an implanted channel region having acceptable mobility. For example the implanted channel region may be formed by implanting ions with an implant energy of 90 keV or less and or with a dose of 9 10atoms cmor less.

Furthermore the implants may be performed at an elevated temperature for example at a temperature greater than about 350 C. In particular embodiments the implants may be performed at a temperature of about 1100 C. By performing the implants at an elevated temperature lattice damage that may occur during the implantation process may be annealed out as it occurs. Accordingly the crystal quality of the implanted region may be maintained or even improved during the implantation process.

After implantation of dopants into the channel layer to form the implanted channel region an activation anneal may be performed at a temperature in a range of about 1400 C. to about 1700 C. for about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes. Following the activation anneal the implanted channel layer may have excellent crystal quality. For example the implanted channel layer may have lattice damage that is below the threshold at which the lattice damage may affect the mobility of the layer.

As further illustrated in n regions and are provided in the source and drain regions of the device respectively. As used herein p or n refer to regions that are defined by higher carrier concentrations than are present in adjacent or other regions of the same or another layer or substrate. Regions and are typically of n type conductivity silicon carbide and have carrier concentrations that are greater than the carrier concentration of the channel layer . For the n regions and carrier concentrations of about 1 10cmmay be suitable but carrier concentrations as high as possible may be advantageous.

Ohmic contacts and are provided on the implanted regions and respectively and are spaced apart so as to provide a source contact and a drain contact . The ohmic contacts and are preferably formed of nickel and or other suitable metals. An insulator layer such as an oxide may be further provided on the exposed surface of the device to provide mechanical protection and electrical isolation to the exposed surface of the device as well as to passivate unterminated chemical bonds on the surfaces of the semiconductor layers.

Referring again to the gate contact may be provided on the channel layer between the source region and the drain region . In some embodiments of the present invention the gate contact may be provided in a recess in the channel layer as illustrated in . Furthermore as described below a cap layer may be provided on the channel layer as illustrated in and the gate may be formed in a double recess i.e. a first recess through a cap layer and a second recess into the channel layer .

The gate contact may be formed of chromium platinum platinum silicide nickel gold and or TiWN however other metals known to one skilled in the art to form Schottky contacts to SiC may be used. The Schottky gate contact typically has a three layer structure. For example the gate contact can optionally include a first gate layer of chromium Cr contacting the n type conductivity channel layer . Such a structure may have advantages because of the high adhesion of chromium Cr . The gate contact may farther include an overlayer of platinum Pt and gold or other highly conductive metal. Alternatively the gate contact may include a first layer of nickel in the first recess on the channel layer . The gate contact may further include an overlayer on the first layer of nickel that includes a layer of gold.

As further illustrated in metal overlayers and may be provided on the source contacts the drain contact and the gate contact respectively. The overlayers and may be gold silver aluminum platinum and or copper. Other suitable highly conductive metals may also be used for the overlayers.

In selecting the dimensions of the MESFET the width of the gate is defined as the dimension of the gate perpendicular to the flow of current. As shown in the cross section of the gate width runs into and out of the page. The length of the gate is the dimension of the gate parallel to the flow of electrons from the source to the drain . The gate length is the dimension of the gate that is in contact with the channel layer . For example the gate length of the MESFET according to certain embodiments of the present invention may be from about 0.4 m to about 0.7 m. Another important dimension is the source to gate distance i.e. the distance from the n source region to the gate contact . The source to gate distance according to certain embodiments of the present invention may be from about 0.5 m to about 0.7 m. Furthermore the distance from the n drain region to the gate may be from about 1.5 m to about 2 m. Embodiments of the present invention may further include a plurality of unit cells of MESFETs and the distance from a first gate of the unit cells to a second gate may be for example from about 20 m to about 50 m.

Referring now to a cross sectional view of a transistor according to further embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. Like numbers refer to like elements in previously described figures thus detailed descriptions of these elements will be omitted. As seen in transistors according to certain embodiments of the present invention include a first recess in the channel layer . The first recess is provided between first and second no regions and i.e. between the source region and the drain region of the device. The first recess extends into the channel layer . In some embodiments the first recess may extend towards but not into the implanted channel region . In other embodiments the first recess may extend to and or into the implanted channel layer .

The first recess may be formed by partially etching the channel layer . The first recess may be formed by an etching process such as a dry or wet etch process. For example the first recess may be formed by dry etching for example Electron Cyclotron Resonance ECR or Inductively Coupled Plasma ICP etching. Techniques for etching silicon carbide are well known in the art and need not be described further herein. Since the conductivity and or the location of the implanted channel layer may be more accurately controlled by utilizing embodiments of the present invention etching the channel layer may be more easily performed. For example a timed etch may be performed to form the first recess which may avoid the need for repeatedly etching the recess and testing the sheet resistance of the channel region after each iteration to determine if the etch process should be repeated.

Referring now to a cross sectional view of a transistor according to further embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. Like numbers refer to like elements in previously described figures thus detailed descriptions of these elements will be omitted. As seen in transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention may include a double recessed structure containing first and second recesses as illustrated in . In particular an n type silicon carbide cap layer may be formed on the channel layer . A first recess has a floor that extends through the cap layer to the channel layer . A second recess into the channel layer is provided between the sidewalls of the first recess. A first sidewall of the first recess is between the source and the gate and a second sidewall of the first recess is between the drain and the fate . The floor of the second recess extends into the channel layer by for example a distance of about 600 . The double recessed structure is discussed further in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 136 456 to Sriram. According to some embodiments of the invention the second recess may extend into the channel layer but not into the implanted channel layer . In other embodiments the first recess may extend to and or into the implanted channel layer .

The cap layer may have for example a carrier concentration of about 1 10cmand a thickness of about 900 .

Referring now to a cross sectional view of a transistor according to further embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. Like numbers refer to like elements in previously described figures thus detailed descriptions of these elements will be omitted. As seen in in some embodiments an implanted channel region may be formed in a silicon carbide substrate . Moreover as the cap layer is optional fabrication of SiC MESFETs may be greatly simplified as the device may be formed without the necessity of forming epitaxial layers on a growth substrate. In the embodiments of the substrate may be a semi insulating silicon carbide substrate fabricated as described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6 218 680 to Carter et. al. entitled Semi insulating Silicon Carbide Without Vanadium Domination the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein as if set forth in its entirety. Such a semi insulating substrate may be produced by providing silicon carbide substrates with sufficiently high levels of point defects and sufficiently matched levels of p type and n type dopants such that the resistivity of the silicon carbide substrate is dominated by the point defects. Such a domination may be accomplished by fabricating the silicon carbide substrate at elevated temperatures with source powders that have concentrations of heavy metals transition elements or other deep level trapping elements of less than about 1 10cmand preferably less than about 1 10cm. For example source powder temperatures between about 2360 C. and 2380 C. with the seed being about 300 C. to about 500 C. lower may be utilized. Thus it is preferred that the semi insulating substrate be substantially free of heavy metal transition element dopants or other deep level trapping elements such as vanadium such that the resistivity of the substrate is not dominated by such heavy metals or transition elements. While it is preferred that the semi insulating substrate be free of such heavy metal transition element dopants or deep level trapping elements such elements may be present in measurable amounts while still benefiting from the teachings of the present invention if the presence of such materials does not substantially affect the electrical properties of the MESFETs described herein.

As further illustrated in a second buffer layer and an unintentionally doped channel layer are grown or deposited on the buffer layer . It will be understood that if the buffer layer is not included the second buffer layer and the channel layer may be grown or deposited on the substrate . The second buffer layer is formed on the buffer layer and the channel layer is formed on the second buffer layer as illustrated in .

As further illustrated in first impurity atoms are implanted into the channel layer to form the implanted channel region . The first impurity atoms may be implanted in a single implant step and or in multiple implant steps. For example the implanted channel region may be formed by implanting ions with an implant energy of 90 keV or less and or with a dose of 9 10atoms cmor less.

Furthermore the implants may be performed at an elevated temperature for example at a temperature greater than about 350 C. In particular embodiments the implants may be performed at a temperature of about 1100 C.

After implantation of dopants into the channel layer to form the implanted channel region an activation anneal may be performed at a temperature in a range of about 1400 C. to about 1700 C. for about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes. Following the activation anneal the implanted channel layer may have excellent crystal quality. For example the implanted channel layer may have lattice damage that is below the threshold at which the lattice damage may affect the mobility of the layer. For example the implanted channel layer may have a conductivity mobility in excess of 150 cm V s. In some embodiments the implanted channel layer may have a conductivity mobility in excess of 200 cm V s.

As illustrated in a mask may be formed for implanting the n regions and . Regions and are typically formed by ion implantation of second impurity atoms of for example nitrogen A or phosphorus P followed by a high temperature anneal. Suitable anneal temperatures may be from about 1100 C. to about 1600 C. The implanted channel region and the implanted regions and may be annealed simultaneously. The ion implantation may be performed on the regions which are not covered by the mask to form n regions and as illustrated in . Thus the ions are selectively implanted into portions of the channel layer to provide highly doped regions of n type conductivity for example n type conductivity SiC having relatively high carrier concentrations.

As discussed above embodiments of the present invention may include a double recessed structure instead of the single recess . As illustrated in a first recess of the double recessed structure may be formed by forming a mask for the first recess and etching through the cap layer to form the first recess according to the mask. An insulation layer may be formed after the first recess has been formed. After forming the source drain ohmic contacts a second recess of the double recessed structure may be formed by forming a second mask for the second recess and etching the recess according to the mask. The channel layer may be etched into a distance of for example about 600 to form the second recess . Methods of fabricating a double recessed structure are discussed further in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 136 456 to Sriram.

As seen in the substrate the buffer layer the second buffer layer and the n type conductivity channel layer may be etched to form an isolation mesa. The mesa has sidewalls defined by the substrate the buffer layer the second buffer layer and the channel layer that define the periphery of the transistor. The mesa may be formed to extend into the substrate of the device as shown in . The mesa may extend past the implanted channel region of the device to confine current flow in the device to the mesa and reduce the capacitance of the device. The mesa is preferably formed by reactive ion etching the above described device however other methods known to one skilled in the art may be used to form the mesa. Furthermore if a mesa is not utilized the device may be isolated using other methods such as proton bombardment counterdoping with compensating atoms or other methods known to those skilled in the art.

In certain embodiments only the second buffer layer and the channel layer may be etched to form an isolation mesa. In these embodiments the sidewalls are defined by the second buffer layer and the channel layer which define the periphery of the transistor.

As further illustrated in contact windows may be etched through the insulator layer to the n regions and . An ohmic metal such as nickel may then be evaporated to deposit the source and drain contacts and respectively. The nickel may be annealed to form the ohmic contacts and as illustrated in . Such a deposition and annealing process may be carried out utilizing conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example the ohmic contacts and may be annealed at a temperature of from about 650 C. to about 100 C. for about 2 minutes. However other times and temperatures may also be utilized. Times from about 30 seconds to about 10 minutes may be acceptable.

Since the channel region of a device according to some embodiments of the invention is implanted many different dopant profiles can be accurately and repeatably created within the channel region . Accordingly operational properties of MESFET devices according to some embodiments of the invention may be more accurately controlled and or engineered compared to conventional MESFET structures in which the channel region is doped during epitaxial growth.

For example referring to a device according to some embodiments of the invention may include an n type conductivity channel region including a first n type conductivity sublayer A and a second n type conductivity sublayer B beneath the first n type conductivity sublayer A. The gate contact may extend into the first n type conductivity sublayer A. The first n type conductivity sublayer A may have a higher dopant concentration than the second n type conductivity sublayer B.

Moreover a double recessed structure may be used such as is described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 136 456 to Sriram the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth herein.

In further embodiments the n type conductivity channel region may include first second and third layers of n type conductivity SiC as described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 136 456 to Sriram the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. For example as shown in a device includes an n type channel region that includes a first sublayer A a second sublayer B and a third sublayer C disposed between the first and second sublayers A B.

Delta doping of channels may be accomplished more accurately and or reliably according to some embodiments of the invention. For example the implanted channel region of the device may have a dual peak configuration. That is the implanted channel region may include a pair of dopant concentration peaks formed in multiple implant steps corresponding to the first and second n type conductivity sublayers A B. The first and second n type conductivity sublayers A B may be spaced apart from one another to provide a channel region having first second and third sublayers A B C similar to the structure described in the above referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 136 456. The first sublayer A may have a first dopant concentration the second sublayer B may have a second dopant concentration and the third sublayer C disposed between the first and second sublayers A B may have a third dopant concentration that is less than the first and second dopant concentrations. In brief the more highly doped regions i.e. the first and second sublayers A B near the concentration peaks may act as carrier supply regions for the central sublayer C of relatively low dopant concentration between the two dopant peaks. The centrally located third sublayer C may have increased mobility compared to the more highly doped first and second sublayers A B which may result in improved device performance. The gate contact may extend to into the third sublayer C.

Implantation of n type dopant atoms into silicon carbide layers was performed using various implant conditions. In one experiment a dose of 6 10cmnitrogen atoms was implanted into three silicon carbide wafers each of which included a 0.7 m thick unintentionally doped epitaxial layer of 4H polytype silicon carbide. The nitrogen implants were performed at 90 keV at a temperature of approximately 1100 C. After implantation the wafers were annealed at about 1600 C. to activate the implants. A TRIM simulation of the implantation is shown in . As shown therein the simulated implant profile has a peak concentration of about 7 10cmat a depth of about 1600 160 nm . After a sacrificial oxidation and BCletch about 200 of material at the surface was removed. Capacitance Voltage C V measurements were performed on the implanted layers using a mercury probe. From the C V measurements a doping profile of an implanted channel region was calculated. The resulting doping profile is shown in . As is apparent from the measured doping profile shows excellent agreement with the simulated doping profile after accounting for material loss due to the sacrificial oxidation BCletch.

A total charge of 5 10cmin the implanted region was calculated from the C V data. In addition Lehighton conductance measurements performed on the layer revealed a typical sheet resistance R of 5700 ohms square. The pinch off depletion voltage of the implanted channel region was measured to be about 12V.

Conductivity mobility of the implanted channel region was calculated from the total charge and Rvalues as follows 

The implanted channel regions had an average conductivity mobility value of 234 cmV s which compares favorably with conductivity mobility of similar layers formed using epitaxial doping.

Gate recesses were etched using an NFICP etch in the first wafer W for 85 seconds and the sheet resistance Rof the implanted channel region was measured to be about 8900 ohms square. The other two wafers W W were etched for 70 seconds using an NFICP etch. The sheet resistance of wafers W and W after recess etch was measured to be about 6800 ohms square on average. A histogram of the measured sheet resistance values for wafers W and W is shown in .

T top gates were formed in the etched recesses of each of the second and third wafers W and W and threshold voltages Vth for each of the channels was measured. A histogram of the measurement results is shown in . As shown in the wafers exhibited little statistical variation in Vth across each wafer and from wafer to wafer.

In a separate experiment four quadrants of a semi insulating HPSI wafer were implanted with nitrogen using four different implant conditions. Each quadrant was implanted with ions at both 30 keV and 60 keV energy levels. All implants were performed at a temperature of about 1100 C. The implanted wafer was annealed at about 1600 C. for about 5 minutes.

The total dose at 30 keV and 60 keV 4 10cmand 9 10cm respectively for Quadrants and was the same. However Quadrant received one dose of 4 10cmat 30 keV and one dose of 9 10cmat 60 keV while Quadrant received two doses of 2 10cmat 30 keV and two doses of 4.5 10cmat 60 keV. Quadrant received one dose of 2 10cmat 30 keV and one dose of 4.5 10cmat 60 keV. Quadrant received one dose of 2 10cmand one dose of 4 10cmat 30 keV and one dose of 4.5 10cmand one dose of 9 10cma at 60 keV. The total doses of the four quadrants are summarized in Table 3.

Sheet resistance of the wafers was measured using a Lehighton contactless sheet resistance measurement tool. The Lehighton sheet resistance data is shown in the graph of . The quadrant dependence of the sheet resistance is apparent from the graph shown in . Capacitance voltage measurements were also performed on the wafer and charge density and doping were calculated from the C V measurements. Recesses were etched into the wafer an the sheet resistance of the channels beneath the recesses was measured. Gates were formed in the recesses and the pinch off voltage of the devices was measured. Conductivity mobility was calculated from the channel sheet resistance and the charge density. The Lehighton sheet resistance charge density doping and calculated conductivity mobility for the four quadrants is summarized in Table 4.

As the data in Table 4 indicate excellent mobility can be obtained at reasonable doping levels. As seen in Table 4 the implanted quadrants may have a charge density in a range of about 3 10cmto about 2 10cm and a peak doping in the range of 3 10cmto about 2 10cm. The sheet resistivity may be about 4000 ohms square to about 7500 ohms square and the conductivity mobility may be from about 100 cm V s to about 240 cm V s.
