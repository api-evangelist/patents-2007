abstract: A novel system for speech recognition uses differential cepstra over time frames as acoustic features, together with the traditional static cepstral features, for hidden trajectory modeling, and provides greater accuracy and performance in automatic speech recognition. According to one illustrative embodiment, an automatic speech recognition method includes receiving a speech input, generating an interpretation of the speech, and providing an output based at least in part on the interpretation of the speech input.

Improving the accuracy and performance of automatic speech recognition has been an active area of research. These have included modeling human speech using methods such as hidden Markov models and hidden trajectory models. For example a statistical hidden trajectory model may use temporal filtering of hidden vocal tract resonance targets to estimate a hidden trajectory for a vocal tract resonance. The targets used in the hidden trajectory model are described as being stochastic with a phoneme dependent probability distribution. Thus each phoneme has a mean target and a target variance. In the past the mean target and the target variance have been determined using a vocal tract resonance tracker.

Using the tracker hidden trajectory values for individual phonemes are collected and the statistical distribution of the vocal tract resonances is used to identify the means and variances for the targets. The vocal tract resonance tracker is prone to errors in the vocal tract resonances identified by the tracker which are propagated into the target distributions. As a result the target distributions are incorrect sometimes resulting in undesirable performance of the hidden trajectory model. Also the acoustic features such as cepstra used in the past are static losing some useful information that can be provided by the dynamic or temporal differential features.

The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A novel system for speech recognition uses static cepstra and differential cepstra over time frames as acoustic features for hidden trajectory modeling and provides greater accuracy and performance in automatic speech recognition. According to one illustrative embodiment an automatic speech recognition method includes receiving a speech input generating an interpretation of the speech and providing an output based at least in part on the interpretation of the speech input. The interpretation of the speech uses hidden trajectory modeling with observation vectors that are based on cepstra and on differential cepstra derived from the cepstra. A method is developed that can automatically train the hidden trajectory model s parameters that correspond to the components of the differential cepstra in the acoustic feature vectors.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in the background.

Method provides an illustrative way to train a hidden trajectory model using cepstra and time ordered differential cepstra. This includes estimating mean target vocal tract resonance VTR vectors for a set of speech units such as phones phonemes syllables or sentences for example. A hidden trajectory model is a two stage model that provides a probability of an observation vector given a speech unit such as a phoneme. In the first stage of the model a probability distribution for vocal tract resonance VTR trajectories is described in terms of a filtered sequence of VTR target distributions. In the second stage of the hidden trajectory model the probability of an observation vector is described in terms of a non linear function of the vocal tract resonance trajectory and a residual model.

Making reference to method begins with step in which a speech signal generated by a trainer reading from a text is received by an analog to digital A D converter . At step the speech signal is converted into digital frames by converting the analog signal into digital samples using A D converter and forming frames of digital samples using frame constructor . At step the frames derived from the speech signal are used to form observed feature vectors for each frame using feature extractor . In one illustrative embodiment A D converter samples the analog speech signal at 16 kHz with 16 bits per sample thereby creating 32 kilobytes of speech data per second and frame constructor creates a new frame every 10 milliseconds that includes 25 milliseconds worth of data for example. Under various embodiments feature extractor may extract observed feature vectors as linear predictive coding LPC cepstral feature vectors perceptual linear prediction PLP cepstral feature vectors mel frequency cepstra feature vectors fast Fourier transform FFT feature vectors or other types of vectors for example.

At step observed cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors are aligned with speech units by a hidden trajectory model HTM alignment component . HTM alignment component uses a dictionary not shown to divide text into speech units. It then aligns the sequences of observed cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors with the speech units using a hidden trajectory model not shown which describes the probability of each speech unit given the sequence of observed cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors . This results in an alignment which associates cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors and thereby the frames associated with the cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors with speech units in the training speech signal.

Method of continues at step to evaluate cepstra and differential cepstra model parameters which may be generally labeled as for each frame of the speech signal by model parameter calculator . As noted below the model parameters may be determined using EQ. 5 below and alignment . Once the model parameters have been determined for each frame k the process continues at step where a conditional distribution is evaluated by a trajectory calculator . For example in an illustrative embodiment the conditional distribution may be evaluated as a probability density function of the time ordered observed feature vectors and the time ordered hidden trajectory vectors and may be evaluated using the time ordered hidden trajectory vectors a parameter free prediction function acting on the time ordered observed cepstra and differential cepstra trajectory vectors and vector and matrix differential cepstra parameters as in EQ. 9 below.

At step trajectory calculator produces trajectory representing a conditional distribution of the cepstra and differential cepstra trajectory vectors using initial targets which in one embodiment are generally accepted values for the vocal tract resonances for the various speech units. Trajectory calculator calculates the mean trajectory by applying filter parameters and initial targets as to EQ. 5 below. The resulting mean trajectory is taken as trajectory .

At step a residual model is trained by a residual model trainer using trajectory . Residual model is trained by taking the difference between observed cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors and cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors predicted using the corresponding value of trajectory .

where r is the residual and ois the observed cepstra feature vector for the kth frame. The residuals r are grouped by speech units and the mean and covariance for each group are computed to produce the residual model . Differentials between time ordered cepstra may also be used for acoustic features and combined with the cepstra features for that purpose these are discussed in more detail further below after the description of the system using the cepstra alone.

At step means are determined for the targets residual model is provided to a target calculator along with observed cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors filter parameters and trajectory . Target calculator determines the mean vocal tract resonance target vectors of each speech unit as elaborated further below.

At step the mean target vectors are assessed by a convergence test to determine if the values have converged. If they have not converged the mean target vectors are provided to trajectory calculator which uses the mean target vectors in EQ. 5 below to re evaluate the distribution of cepstra and differential cepstra features and determine a new sequence of trajectories at step . The new trajectory values are then used to retrain residual model at step as described above. The new residual model and the new trajectories are then used to recalculate the mean target vectors at step .

Steps and may be repeated iteratively until the mean target vectors converge at step . When the mean target vectors converge the mean target vectors are set as the final targets and the process may end at step where the method is finished with training the speech recognition model using differential cepstra and ready to receive subsequent speech signals and provide outputs based on interpretations of the speech signals.

Under one embodiment the first stage of the hidden trajectory model describes the vocal tract resonance trajectory as being generated from segmental targets applied to a bi directional finite impulse response filter as 

where zis the trajectory in the kth time frame for speech unit s tis the VTR target vector for speech unit s at time frame is a coarticulation parameter that indicates the spatial extent of coarticulation and is correlated with speaking effort and 2D 1 represents the length of the filter s impulse response hand determines the temporal extent of coarticulation. In one illustrative embodiment the coarticulation parameter may have a value of 0.6 for all speech units s for example.

Under one embodiment the speech unit dependent target vector tin EQ. 2 is assumed to be a random vector with a Gaussian distribution EQ. 3 

where is the mean of the target vector and is the variance of the target vector which in many embodiments may be assumed to be diagonal. Under one embodiment the model tracks the frequency and bandwidth of four vocal tract resonances. Under such an embodiment the mean contains eight components such that ffffbbbb where frepresents a target frequency and brepresents a corresponding target bandwidth for a vocal tract resonance.

Due to the linearity between z and t shown in EQ. 2 the assumption that the target vector is a Gaussian leads to the VTR trajectory also being a Gaussian such that EQ. 4 

Combining EQS. 2 3 and 4 the mean vector of the Gaussian distribution for the vocal tract resonance trajectory z k is derived as 

where the right hand side of EQ. 5 represents the dot product of filter parameter vector and matrix is a filter parameter vector with individual elements of the vector consisting of equations and is a matrix of target means with a separate row for each speech unit that can be observed during recognition and a separate column for each component of the target vector. In one embodiment 58 different speech unit components such as phonemes may be used for example. This may be representative of a number of identified phonemes assigned to the phonemes used in a particular human language according to its standard dialect and pronunciation. For example Chinese has 58 standard phonemes and Ukrainian and Lithuanian also happen to have 58 standard phonemes. Other natural human languages have anywhere from fewer than a dozen to over 100 phonemes. Any of these numbers of phoneme components or any number of any type of speech segments may be used as components for the target means in various embodiments.

In time is shown along horizontal axis and frequency is shown along vertical axis . shows five target distributions and represented as boxes having target means and respectively. In the height of each box representing a target vector distribution provides an indication of the variance of the distribution. Based on the bi directional filtering of EQ. 5 the mean for the vocal tract resonance trajectory follows the path and has a variance as indicated by the vertical distance between upper band and lower band .

Referring again to EQ. 5 there is no explicit expression for the filter parameter vector in the equation. Instead each can be constructed based on the ordering and identity of the phones phonemes or other speech segments in the sequence in the speech signal in this illustrative embodiment. Specifically each may be generated based on an alignment of training speech data with text. This alignment indicates which target means and smoothing parameters are used to determine the current trajectory mean in EQ. 5. Using these alignments the values of can be determined through an algorithm. For example if instead of using 58 speech units 5 speech units were used with the following form 

where a filter size of D 3 has been used and each filter parameter vector contains five elements. Using EQ. 5 above each fth component of is 

where l is an index for the speech units L is the total number of speech units available in the language such as 58 phoneme speech units as illustratively introduced above and f is an index into the frequency and bandwidth components of the target vector.

Approximating the covariance matrix by a diagonal matrix for each speech unit l the elements of the diagonal are represented a vector EQ. 9 

In EQ. 7 and EQ. 11 and are frame dependent k vectors that are both a function of the speech unit identities and temporal orders in the speech signal but that are independent of the vocal tract resonance dimension.

The second stage of the Hidden Trajectory Model provides a probabilistic mapping from the stochastic Vocal Tract Resonance VTR hidden trajectory zto a stochastic observation trajectory o as functions of a time frame k such that the mapping provides the probability of an observed vector given a hidden trajectory value. Under one embodiment the observation trajectory takes the form of linear predictive coding LPC cepstra and the mapping uses a fixed parameter free non linear prediction function F z and a Gaussian residual model where is the mean vector and is the covariance matrix respectively of the residual model. In one particular embodiment the mapping provides a conditional distribution of cepstra as a Gaussian distribution EQ. 12 

which gives the value of F z for the nth LPC cepstral order where fis the sampling frequency of the speech signal fis a VTR frequency bis a corresponding VTR bandwidth and P is the number of VTR frequencies. and are the model parameters related to the cepstral prediction residual component subject to optimization from the cepstral observation trajectory data o.

The prior distribution of zfor each time frame k given a phonetic unit or state s can be modeled as a Gaussian distribution EQ. 14 

Here the mean vector and the covariance matrix are dependent on the underlying model parameters representing the phonetic targets and on the coarticulatory properties of the stochastic target directed hidden speech dynamics.

To compute the acoustic likelihood p o s the hidden variable zmay be marginalized to obtain the following EQ. 15 

For computational tractability it may be desirable to linearize the non linear prediction function F z . Under one embodiment this may be accomplished using a first order vector Taylor series expansion such that EQ. 17 

where zis the Taylor series expansion point which may be obtained by a high quality VTR or formant tracker in an illustrative embodiment and where F z is the derivative of F z with respect to a VTR dimension such that 

for the pth VTR bandwidth component of z. In other embodiments Taylor series of other orders may be applied or altogether different estimation tools may be used to approximate the prediction function F z to the desired combination of accuracy and computing efficiency.

With the approximation of F z in hand the acoustic likelihood p o s may be estimated as follows EQ. 20 

where EQ. 21 EQ. 22 and are cepstral prediction residual parameters that may be used in the learning algorithm.

As described above the Hidden Trajectory Model HTM uses cepstra as static observation vectors. This can be generalized so that the HTM accounts jointly for the cepstra and their time ordered differentials according to various embodiments. The differential cepstra which can also be referred to as delta cepstra may be defined in one illustrative embodiment as daccording to the following 

The differential cepstra are therefore evaluated as a function of a difference between a first cepstral observation trajectory o and a subsequent second cepstral observation trajectory ofrom a time ordered series of cepstral observation trajectories. Here k can be thought of as a reference time with a time interval before the reference time k and the same time interval after the reference time k. The difference between the two time ordered cepstral observation trajectories is divided by two times the time interval so that the differential cepstra dare defined for interval weighted differences. This formulation of differential cepstra dmay be used in lieu of the cepstral observation trajectory vectors oin EQ. 12 which can also be modified to account for a time ordered sequence of VTR hidden trajectory vectors zcorresponding to the time sequence represented by the differential cepstra d to obtain a conditional distribution of differential cepstra as 

where is a vector valued parameter analogous to a mean for the differential cepstra and is a matrix valued parameter analogous to a covariance matrix for the differential cepstra.

 EQ. 24 can then be joined with EQ. 12 to identify the joint conditional distribution of the cepstra and differential cepstra features according to one illustrative embodiment for performing steps and of method in as described above. The joint conditional distribution is 

A variety of different methods for approximating or otherwise evaluating the joint conditional distribution p o d z z z s can be applied in different embodiments. According to one illustrative embodiment the joint conditional distribution can be evaluated using a first order Taylor series approximation for the non linear function F z as shown in EQ. 17 above as provided as follows with some terms consolidated as shown 

The cepstra differential cepstra joint hidden trajectory vector may further be assumed to have a block diagonal Gaussian distribution as 

where and are the covariances of the hidden trajectory vectors at three different time ordered frames. They are determined by the VTR targets covariance parameters of the HTM and by the coarticulation properties of the VTR dynamics and may be considered fixed for purposes of the cepstral prediction residual parameters.

The acoustic likelihood p o d s may then be computed by marginalizing the hidden trajectory variables as EQ. 30 

such that the covariance matrix is enlarged from its value in the joint conditional likelihood distribution of EQ. 25 above.

The acoustic likelihood p o d s provided by EQ. 31 using joint cepstra and the time ordered differentials of the cepstra as the acoustic features provides a principled and advantageous generalization over using only static cepstra as the acoustic features. The quantity A F z from EQ. 15 in the static cepstra only model is generalized in EQ. 27 with a higher dimension and the quantity bfrom EQ. 15 in the static cepstra only model is also generalized with a higher dimension in EQ. 28 . An analogous expansion can be identified for the time varying covariance matrix . These functions of the intrinsic parameters may be computed and therefore the likelihood computed using the intrinsic parameters derived from the training data. The intrinsic parameters according to one illustrative embodiment include and which may be estimated in the generalized Hidden Trajectory Model using maximum likelihood an illustration of which is elaborated as follows.

It may be assumed that the boundaries of each phone unit denoted by s are given either provided by a database or computed from a Hidden Markov Model system in advance. According to an illustrative embodiment the model parameter calculator from the system of may compute the derivatives of the logarithmic products of the acoustic likelihood p o d s over all frames in the training data with respect to the vector valued parameters and which are related to mean vectors of cepstral prediction residuals. Setting the derivatives to zero and solving for the parameters closed form estimation formulas yield estimated parameters as follows 

For estimating the parameters and covariance matrices of cepstral prediction residuals closed form estimation formulas may not be available. In the present illustrative embodiment estimating these parameters may be simplified by assuming diagonality for the parameters and estimating their diagonal elements. A frame independent approximation may also be used with an approximate estimation formula generalized for joint cepstra and differential cepstra features
