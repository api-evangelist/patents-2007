The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties thereof.

The invention relates in general to microelectromechanical MEMS devices and in particular to MEMS devices that provide deflection out of the plane of the MEMS substrate.

Conventional systems for guiding missiles or projectiles in flight use canards or small wing like structures to steer the projectile. These structures are large approximately 3 in length and require motors to actuate. The stabilizing fins on the projectile have to be increased in size to counteract the effect the canards have of moving the center of pressure forward.

A MEMS control surface can reduce drag and hence increase the range of projectiles by eliminating the drag associated with canards and reducing the drag of the fins. In addition MEMS control surfaces may reduce volume weight and power requirements further increasing the projectile s range. Another added benefit of the MEMS control surface is the reduction of cost associated with batch fabrication techniques.

Known MEMS devices for producing a mechanical deflection include various types of thermally actuated beams including cantilever and arch beams. These beams have proven successful in producing a deflection in the plane of the MEMS substrate. Devices such as projectile control surfaces however require a deflection out of the plane of the MEMS substrate that is in a direction perpendicular to the MEMS substrate.

One MEMS type apparatus that provides out of plane deflection is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5 824 910 issued on Oct. 20 1998 and entitled Miniature Hydrostat Fabricated Using Multiple Microelectromechanical Processes. Another MEMS type apparatus that provides out of plane deflection is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 069 392 issued on May 30 2000 and entitled Microbellows Actuator. These two U.S. patents are expressly incorporated by reference. A third MEMS type apparatus that provides out of plane deflection is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 474 593 issued on Nov. 5 2002 and entitled Guided Bullet. 

It is an aspect of the invention to provide a MEMS device that can provide vertical deflection out of the plane of the MEMS substrate.

It is another aspect of the invention to provide a MEMS device that is operable as a control surface for high speed projectiles.

Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide a MEMS device that provides out of plane deflection with a minimum of moving parts.

One aspect of the invention is a MEMS apparatus including a substrate defining a plane a duct attached to the substrate the duct and the substrate defining a fluid flow channel and a rotatable flap having a flow receiving portion and an extension portion the flow receiving portion being disposed in the fluid flow channel where in an actuated position of the flap a fluid flow against the flow receiving portion causes rotation of the flap and movement of the extension portion out of the plane of the substrate. In a rest position of the flap the extension portion is substantially parallel to the plane of the substrate.

The MEMS apparatus may further include a flap support for rotatably supporting the flap. The flap support may include a pair of supports disposed on the substrate on opposite sides of the flap the flap being rotatably connected to the pair of supports.

In one embodiment the MEMS apparatus includes openings in each of the pair of supports a through hole in the flap and an axle disposed in the through hole and the openings in the supports the axle being free to rotate with respect to the flap and the supports.

In a second embodiment the MEMS apparatus includes openings in each of the pair of supports and an axle fixed to the flap the axle being disposed in the openings in the supports and free to rotate with respect to the supports.

In a third embodiment the MEMS apparatus includes a through hole in the flap and an axle fixed to the pair of supports the axle being disposed in the through hole in the flap and free to rotate with respect to the flap.

In a fourth embodiment the MEMS apparatus includes a pair of torsion springs fixed at first ends to the flap and at second ends to the pair of supports respectively the pair of torsion springs being operable to twist as the flap rotates.

Another aspect of the invention is a projectile comprising a flow surface at least one MEMS apparatus as described above disposed at the flow surface such that in a rest position of the flap the MEMS apparatus is substantially flush with the flow surface and in the actuated position of the flap the extension portion of the flap extends out of a plane of the flow surface.

The rotatable support for flap may be realized in many ways. For example the flap support may comprise a pair of supports and B disposed on the substrate on opposite sides of the flap where the flap is rotatably connected to the pair of supports . shows a pair of supports having openings formed therein. The flow receiving portion of flap includes a through hole . An axle is disposed in the through hole and the openings in the supports where the axle is free to rotate with respect to the flap and the supports .

In another embodiment the axle may be fixed to the flap and free to rotate with respect to the supports . In a further exemplary embodiment the axle may be fixed to the supports and free to rotate with respect to the flap . In yet another embodiment the axle may be fixed to both the flap and the supports where the axle includes a torsion spring or pair of torsion springs that are operable to twist as the flap rotates. It is important to locate the axis of rotation the centerline of the axle vertically above the Z direction the horizontal centerline of the flow receiving portion . In this way the moment created by the fluid force on the flow receiving portion will tend to rotate the flap up and away from the substrate .

The rest position of the flap may be maintained in a variety of ways. For example the apparatus may be sized so that during downward rotation of the flap when the extension portion butts against the front surface of the duct the extension portion is substantially horizontal in relation to the X axis and thus the extension portion is substantially parallel to the substrate . Another exemplary method is to use pins or tabs attached to the inside of the supports as shown in . shows one support having stop pins formed thereon. The stop pins may be located on the supports to control maximum rotation of the flap in both the up and down directions. When the flap reaches a maximum rotation the flow receiving portion of the flap will butt against a stop pin .

In an exemplary embodiment the MEMS apparatus may also be used to steer a projectile. shows a projectile . As used herein a projectile may be a missile rocket or any type of projectile with or without fins that is launched in air or water. shows a portion of a flow surface of a projectile . The flow surface may be the external surface of the projectile or it may be the surface of a fin wing rudder etc. A plurality of MEMS apparatus are disposed in an array on the flow surface . The MEMS apparatus may be arrayed in any manner and number required to steer the projectile . When the extension portions of the flaps are extended upward into the flow stream around surface the flaps will influence the flow stream and alter the path of the projectile . A number of the apparatus may be placed in series such that the flow entering at one end is used to actuate the entire series of flaps.

The source of fluid pressure may be external air combustion products from a combustion chamber and or an onboard stored energy source such as a pressure tank or a compressor. When using external air as a source of fluid pressure the flap will rotate until the external fluid force on the flap is the same as the internal fluid force on the flow receiving portion . In this instance flap rotation may be increased by enlarging the area of the flow receiving portion relative to the extension portion

While the invention has been described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
