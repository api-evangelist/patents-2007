title: Methods for the treatment of disease using immunoglobulins having Fc regions with altered affinities for FcγRand FcγR
abstract: The present invention relates to methods of treating or preventing cancer and other diseases using molecules, particularly polypeptides, more particularly immunoglobulins (e.g., antibodies), comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild-type Fc region, which variant Fc region binds an FcγR that activates a cellular effector (“FcγR,” such as FcγRIIA or FcγRIIIA) and an FcγR that inhibits a cellular effector (“FcγR,” such as FcγRIIA) with an altered Ratio of Affinities relative to the respective binding affinities of such FcγR for the Fc region of the wild-type immunoglobulin. The methods of the invention are particularly useful in preventing, treating, or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or infection where either an enhanced efficacy of effector cell function mediated by FcγR is desired (e.g., cancer, infectious disease) or an inhibited effector cell response mediated by FcγR is desired (e.g., inflammation, autoimmune disease).

This Application claims priority from U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60 869 254 filed on Dec. 8 2006 which application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to methods of treating or preventing cancer and other diseases using molecules particularly polypeptides more particularly immunoglobulins e.g. antibodies comprising a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region which variant Fc region binds an Fc R that activates a cellular effector FC R such as Fc RIIA or Fc RIIIA and an Fc R that inhibits a cellular effector Fc R such as Fc RIIA with an altered Ratio of Affinities relative to the respective binding affinities of such Fc R for the Fc region of the wild type immunoglobulin. The methods of the invention are particularly useful in preventing treating or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with a disease disorder or infection where an enhanced efficacy of effector cell function e.g. ADCC mediated by Fc R is desired e.g. cancer infectious disease. The methods of the invention are also of use in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of therapeutic antibodies the effect of which is mediated by ADCC. Conversely the methods of the invention are particularly useful in preventing treating or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with a disease or disorder in which decreased efficacy of effector cell function mediated by Fc R is desired e.g. inflammation etc. The methods of the invention are thus also of use in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of therapeutic antibodies which attenuate inflammatory processes.

The interaction of antibody antigen complexes with cells of the immune system results in a wide array of responses ranging from effector functions such as antibody dependent cytotoxicity mast cell degranulation and phagocytosis to immunomodulatory signals such as regulating lymphocyte proliferation and antibody secretion. All these interactions are initiated through the binding of the Fc domain of antibodies or immune complexes to specialized cell surface receptors on hematopoietic cells. The diversity of cellular responses triggered by antibodies and immune complexes results from the structural heterogeneity of Fc receptors. Fc receptors share structurally related ligand binding domains which presumably mediate intracellular signaling.

The Fc receptors members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily of proteins are surface glycoproteins that can bind the Fc portion of immunoglobulin molecules. Each member of the family recognizes immunoglobulins of one or more isotypes through a recognition domain on the a chain of the Fc receptor. Fc receptors are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin subtypes. Fc receptors for IgG are referred to as Fc R for IgE as F R and for IgA as Fc R. Different accessory cells bear Fc receptors for antibodies of different isotype and the isotype of the antibody determines which accessory cells will be engaged in a given response reviewed by Ravetch J. V. et al. 19919 457 92 Gerber J. S. et al. 2001 3 131 139 Billadeau D. D. et al. 20022 109 161 1681 Ravetch J. V. et al. 2000290 84 89 Ravetch J. V. et al. 2001 19 275 90 Ravetch J. V. 199478 4 553 60 . The different Fc receptors the cells that express them and their isotype specificity is well known in the art see e.g. 4ed. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd Garland Publishing New York which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Each member of this family is an integral membrane glycoprotein possessing extracellular domains related to a C2 set of immunoglobulin related domains a single membrane spanning domain and an intracytoplasmic domain of variable length. There are three known Fc Rs designated Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD16 . The three receptors are encoded by distinct genes however the extensive homology between the three family members suggest they arose from a common progenitor perhaps by gene duplication.

Fc RII proteins are 40 KDa integral membrane glycoproteins which bind only the complexed IgG due to a low affinity for monomeric Ig 10M . This receptor is the most widely expressed Fc R present on all hematopoietic cells including monocytes macrophages B cells NK cells neutrophils mast cells and platelets. Fc RII has only two immunoglobulin like regions in its immunoglobulin binding chain and hence a much lower affinity for IgG than Fc RI. There are three human Fc RII genes Fc RII A Fc RII B Fc RII C all of which bind IgG in aggregates or immune complexes.

Distinct differences within the cytoplasmic domains of Fc RII A and Fc RII B create two functionally heterogenous responses to receptor ligation. The fundamental difference is that the A isoform initiates intracellular signaling leading to cell activation such as phagocytosis and respiratory burst whereas the B isoform initiates inhibitory signals e.g. inhibiting B cell activation.

Both activating and inhibitory signals are transduced through the Fc Rs following ligation. These diametrically opposing functions result from structural differences among the different receptor isoforms. Two distinct domains within the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the receptor called immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs ITAMs or immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs ITIMS account for the different responses. The recruitment of different cytoplasmic enzymes to these structures dictates the outcome of the Fc R mediated cellular responses. ITAM containing Fc R complexes include Fc RI Fc RIIA Fc RIIIA whereas ITIM containing complexes only include Fc RIIB.

Human neutrophils express the Fc RIIA gene. Fc RIIA clustering via immune complexes or specific antibody cross linking serves to aggregate ITAMs along with receptor associated kinases which facilitate ITAM phosphorylation. ITAM phosphorylation serves as a docking site for Syk kinase activation of which results in activation of downstream substrates e.g. PIK . Cellular activation leads to release of proinflammatory mediators.

The Fc RIIB gene is expressed on B lymphocytes its extracellular domain is 96 identical to Fc RIIA and binds IgG complexes in an indistinguishable manner. The presence of an ITIM in the cytoplasmic domain of Fc RIIB defines this inhibitory subclass of Fc R. Recently the molecular basis of this inhibition was established. When colligated along with an activating Fc R the ITIM in Fc RIIB becomes phosphorylated and attracts the SH2 domain of the inosital polyphosphate 5 phosphatase SHIP which hydrolyzes phosphoinositol messengers released as a consequence of ITAM containing Fc R mediated tyrosine kinase activation consequently preventing the influx of intracellular Ca. Thus crosslinking of Fc RIIB dampens the activating response to Fc R ligation and inhibits cellular responsiveness. B cell activation B cell proliferation and antibody secretion is thus aborted.

A neoplasm or tumor is a neoplastic mass resulting from abnormal uncontrolled cell growth which can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors generally remain localized. Malignant tumors are collectively termed cancers. The term malignant generally means that the tumor can invade and destroy neighboring body structures and spread to distant sites to cause death for review see Robbins and Angell 19762d Ed. W.B. Saunders Co. Philadelphia pp. 68 122 . Cancer can arise in many sites of the body and behave differently depending upon its origin. Cancerous cells destroy the part of the body in which they originate and then spread to other part s of the body where they start new growth and cause more destruction.

More than 1.2 million Americans develop cancer each year. Cancer is the second leading case of death in the United States and if current trends continue cancer is expected to be the leading cause of the death by the year 2010. Lung and prostate cancer are the top cancer killers for men in the United States. Lung and breast cancer are the top cancer killers for women in the United States. One in two men in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer at some time during his lifetime. One in three women in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer at some time during her lifetime.

A cure for cancer has yet to be found. Current treatment options such as surgery chemotherapy and radiation treatment are oftentimes either ineffective or present serious side effects.

Currently cancer therapy may involve surgery chemotherapy hormonal therapy and or radiation treatment to eradicate neoplastic cells in a patient See for example Stockdale 1998 Principles of Cancer Patient Management in vol. 3 Rubenstein and Federman eds. Chapter 12 Section IV . Recently cancer therapy could also involve biological therapy or immunotherapy. All of these approaches pose significant drawbacks for the patient. Surgery for example may be contraindicated due to the health of the patient or may be unacceptable to the patient. Additionally surgery may not completely remove the neoplastic tissue. Radiation therapy is only effective when the neoplastic tissue exhibits a higher sensitivity to radiation than normal tissue and radiation therapy can also often elicit serious side effects. Hormonal therapy is rarely given as a single agent and although can be effective is often used to prevent or delay recurrence of cancer after other treatments have removed the majority of the cancer cells. Biological therapies immunotherapies are limited in number and may produce side effects such as rashes or swellings flu like symptoms including fever chills and fatigue digestive tract problems or allergic reactions.

With respect to chemotherapy there are a variety of chemotherapeutic agents available for treatment of cancer. A significant majority of cancer chemotherapeutics act by inhibiting DNA synthesis either directly or indirectly by inhibiting the biosynthesis of the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate precursors to prevent DNA replication and concomitant cell division See for example Gilman et al. Goodman and Gilman s Eighth Ed. Pergamom Press New York 1990 . These agents which include alkylating agents such as nitrosourea anti metabolites such as methotrexate and hydroxyurea and other agents such as etoposides campathecins bleomycin doxorubicin daunorubicin etc. although not necessarily cell cycle specific kill cells during S phase because of their effect on DNA replication. Other agents specifically colchicine and the vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine and vincristine interfere with microtubule assembly resulting in mitotic arrest. Chemotherapy protocols generally involve administration of a combination of chemotherapeutic agents to increase the efficacy of treatment.

Despite the availability of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents chemotherapy has many drawbacks See for example Stockdale 1998 Principles Of Cancer Patient Management in 3 Rubenstein and Federman eds. ch. 12 sect. 10 . Almost all chemotherapeutic agents are toxic and chemotherapy causes significant and often dangerous side effects including severe nausea bone marrow depression immunosuppression etc. Additionally even with administration of combinations of chemotherapeutic agents many tumor cells are resistant or develop resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents. In fact those cells resistant to the particular chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment protocol often prove to be resistant to other drugs even those agents that act by mechanisms different from the mechanisms of action of the drugs used in the specific treatment this phenomenon is termed pleiotropic drug or multidrug resistance. Thus because of drug resistance many cancers prove refractory to standard chemotherapeutic treatment protocols.

There is a significant need for alternative cancer treatments particularly for treatment of cancer that has proved refractory to standard cancer treatments such as surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. A promising alternative is immunotherapy in which cancer cells are specifically targeted by cancer antigen specific antibodies. Major efforts have been directed at harnessing the specificity of the immune response for example hybridoma technology has enabled the development of tumor selective monoclonal antibodies See Green M. C. et al. 2000 26 269 286 Weiner L M 1999 26 suppl. 14 43 51 and in the past few years the Food and Drug Administration has approved the first MAbs for cancer therapy Rituxin anti CD20 for non Hodgkin s Lymphoma and Herceptin anti c erb 2 HER 2 for metastatic breast cancer Suzanne A. Eccles 20013 86 90 . However the potency of antibody effector function e.g. to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC is an obstacle to such treatment. Methods to improve the efficacy of such immunotherapy are thus needed.

Inflammation is a process by which the body s white blood cells and chemicals protect our bodies from infection by foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses. It is usually characterized by pain swelling warmth and redness of the affected area. Chemicals known as cytokines and prostaglandins control this process and are released in an ordered and self limiting cascade into the blood or affected tissues. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection and may result in the redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain. These changes when occurring for a limited period in the relevant area work to the benefit of the body.

In autoimmune and or inflammatory disorders the immune system triggers an inflammatory response when there are no foreign substances to fight and the body s normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues by mistakenly attacking self. There are many different autoimmune disorders which affect the body in different ways. For example the brain is affected in individuals with multiple sclerosis the gut is affected in individuals with Crohn s disease and the synovium bone and cartilage of various joints are affected in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. As autoimmune disorders progress destruction of one or more types of body tissues abnormal growth of an organ or changes in organ function may result. The autoimmune disorder may affect only one organ or tissue type or may affect multiple organs and tissues. Organs and tissues commonly affected by autoimmune disorders include red blood cells blood vessels connective tissues endocrine glands e.g. the thyroid or pancreas muscles joints and skin. Examples of autoimmune disorders include but are not limited to Hashimoto s thyroiditis pernicious anemia Addison s disease type 1 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus dermatomyositis Sjogren s syndrome dermatomyositis lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis autoimmune inner ear disease myasthenia gravis Reiter s syndrome Graves disease autoimmune hepatitis familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis.

Rheumatoid arthritis RA and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis are types of inflammatory arthritis. Arthritis is a general term that describes inflammation in joints. Some but not all types of arthritis are the result of misdirected inflammation. Besides rheumatoid arthritis other types of arthritis associated with inflammation include the following psoriatic arthritis Reiter s syndrome ankylosing spondylitis arthritis and gouty arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a type of chronic arthritis that occurs in joints on both sides of the body such as both hands wrists or knees . This symmetry helps distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from other types of arthritis. In addition to affecting the joints rheumatoid arthritis may occasionally affect the skin eyes lungs heart blood or nerves.

Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1 of the world s population and is potentially disabling. There are approximately 2.9 million incidences of rheumatoid arthritis in the United States. Two to three times more women are affected than men. The typical age that rheumatoid arthritis occurs is between 25 and 50. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis affects 71 000 young Americans aged eighteen and under affecting six times as many girls as boys.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder where the body s immune system improperly identifies the synovial membranes that secrete the lubricating fluid in the joints as foreign. Inflammation results and the cartilage and tissues in and around the joints are damaged or destroyed. In severe cases this inflammation extends to other joint tissues and surrounding cartilage where it may erode or destroy bone and cartilage and lead to joint deformities. The body replaces damaged tissue with scar tissue causing the normal spaces within the joints to become narrow and the bones to fuse together. Rheumatoid arthritis creates stiffness swelling fatigue anemia weight loss fever and often crippling pain. Some common symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include joint stiffness upon awakening that lasts an hour or longer swelling in a specific finger or wrist joints swelling in the soft tissue around the joints and swelling on both sides of the joint. Swelling can occur with or without pain and can worsen progressively or remain the same for years before progressing.

The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is based on a combination of factors including the specific location and symmetry of painful joints the presence of joint stiffness in the morning the presence of bumps and nodules under the skin rheumatoid nodules results of X ray tests that suggest rheumatoid arthritis and or positive results of a blood test called the rheumatoid factor. Many but not all people with rheumatoid arthritis have the rheumatoid factor antibody in their blood. The rheumatoid factor may be present in people who do not have rheumatoid arthritis. Other diseases can also cause the rheumatoid factor to be produced in the blood. That is why the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is based on a combination of several factors and not just the presence of the rheumatoid factor in the blood.

The typical course of the disease is one of persistent but fluctuating joint symptoms and after about 10 years 90 of sufferers will show structural damage to bone and cartilage. A small percentage will have a short illness that clears up completely and another small percentage will have very severe disease with many joint deformities and occasionally other manifestations of the disease. The inflammatory process causes erosion or destruction of bone and cartilage in the joints. In rheumatoid arthritis there is an autoimmune cycle of persistent antigen presentation T cell stimulation cytokine secretion synovial cell activation and joint destruction. The disease has a major impact on both the individual and society causing significant pain impaired function and disability as well as costing millions of dollars in healthcare expenses and lost wages. See for example the NIH website and the NIAID website .

Currently available therapy for arthritis focuses on reducing inflammation of the joints with anti inflammatory or immunosuppressive medications. The first line of treatment of any arthritis is usually anti inflammatories such as aspirin ibuprofen and Cox 2 inhibitors such as celecoxib and rofecoxib. Second line drugs include gold methotrexate and steroids. Although these are well established treatments for arthritis very few patients remit on these lines of treatment alone. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis have led to the use of methotrexate in combination with antibodies to cytokines or recombinant soluble receptors. For example recombinant soluble receptors for tumor necrosis factor TNF have been used in combination with methotrexate in the treatment of arthritis. However only about 50 of the patients treated with a combination of methotrexate and anti TNF agents such as recombinant soluble receptors for TNF show clinically significant improvement. Many patients remain refractory despite treatment. Difficult treatment issues still remain for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Many current treatments have a high incidence of side effects or cannot completely prevent disease progression. So far no treatment is ideal and there is no cure. Novel therapeutics are needed that more effectively treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders.

Infectious agents that cause disease fall into five groups viruses bacteria fungi protozoa and helminths worms . The remarkable variety of these pathogens has caused the natural selection of two crucial features of adaptive immunity. First the advantage of being able to recognize a wide range of different pathogens has driven the development of receptors on B and T cells of equal or greater diversity. Second the distinct habitats and life cycles of pathogens have to be countered by a range of distinct effector mechanisms. The characteristic features of each pathogen are its mode of transmission its mechanism of replication its pathogenesis or the means by which it causes disease and the response it elicits.

The record of human suffering and death caused by smallpox cholera typhus dysentery malaria etc. establishes the eminence of the infectious diseases. Despite the outstanding successes in control afforded by improved sanitation immunization and antimicrobial therapy the infectious diseases continue to be a common and significant problem of modern medicine. The most common disease of mankind the common cold is an infectious disease as is the feared modern disease AIDS. Some chronic neurological diseases that were thought formerly to be degenerative diseases have proven to be infectious. There is little doubt that the future will continue to reveal the infectious diseases as major medical problems.

An enormous number of human and animal diseases result from virulent and opportunistic infections from any of the above mentioned infectious agents see Belshe Ed. 1984 PSG Publishing Littleton Mass. .

One category of infectious diseases are viral infections for example. Viral diseases of a wide array of tissues including the respiratory tract CNS skin genitourinary tract eyes ears immune system gastrointestinal tract and musculoskeletal system affect a vast number of humans of all ages see Table 328 2 In Wyngaarden and Smith 198818Ed. W.B. Saunders Co. Philadelphia pp. 1750 1753 . Although considerable effort has been invested in the design of effective anti viral therapies viral infections continue to threaten the lives of millions of people worldwide. In general attempts to develop anti viral drugs have focused on several stages of viral life cycle See e.g. Mitsuya et al 19915 2369 2381 discussing HIV . However a common drawback associated with using of many current anti viral drugs is their deleterious side effects such as toxicity to the host or resistance by certain viral strains.

The invention relates to methods of treating or preventing cancer and other diseases disorders and infections using molecules preferably polypeptides and more preferably immunoglobulins e.g. antibodies comprising a variant Fc region having one or more amino acid modifications e.g. substitutions but also including insertions or deletions in one or more regions which modification s alter relative to a wild type Fc region the Ratio of Affinities of the variant Fc region to an activating FC R such as Fc RIIA or Fc RIIIA relative to an inhibiting Fc R such as Fc RIIB 

Of particular interest are Ratios of Affinities in which either Fc RIIIA or Fc RIIA is the Fc Rand Fc RIIB is the Fc R. Where an Fc variant has a Ratio of Affinities greater than 1 the methods of the invention have particular use in providing a therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a disease disorder or infection or the amelioration of a symptom thereof where an enhanced efficacy of effector cell function e.g. ADCC mediated by Fc R is desired e.g. cancer or infectious disease. Such an increased Ratio of Affinities may result from the Fc region of the molecule having relative to a wild type Fe an increase in affinity to an Fc R e.g. Fc RIIIA or Fc RIIA coupled with either an unchanged affinity to an Fc R e.g. Fc RIIB or a decrease in affinity to such Fc R. Alternatively an increased Ratio of Affinities may result from the Fc region of such molecule exhibiting an increase in affinity to both an Fc Rand an Fc R relative to a wild type Fe provided that the increase in affinity to the Fc Rexceeds the increase in affinity to the Fc R or may result from the Fc region of such molecule exhibiting a decreased affinity to both the Fc Rand an Fc R relative to a wild type Fe provided that the decrease in affinity to the Fc Ris less than the decrease in affinity to the Fc R or may result from an unchanged affinity to an FC Rcoupled with a decrease in affinity to an Fc R.

Where an Fv variant has a Ratio of Affinities less than 1 the methods of the invention have particular use in providing a therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a disease or disorder or the amelioration of a symptom thereof where a decreased efficacy of effector cell function mediated by Fc R is desired e.g. autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. Such a decreased Ratio of Affinities may result from the Fe region of the molecule having relative to a wild type Fc a decrease in affinity to an FC R e.g. Fc RIIIA or Fc RIIA coupled with either an unchanged affinity to an FC R e.g. Fc RIIB or an increase in affinity to such FC R. Alternatively a decreased Ratio of Affinities may result from the Fc region of such molecule exhibiting a decrease in affinity to both an Fc Rand an FC R relative to a wild type Fe provided that the decrease in affinity to the Fc Rexceeds the decrease in affinity to the Fc R or may result from the Fc region of such molecule exhibiting an increased affinity to both an Fc Rand an Fc R relative to a wild type Fe provided that the increase in affinity to the FC Ris less than the increase in affinity to the Fc R or may result from an unchanged affinity to an FC Rcoupled with an increase in affinity to an FC R.

Current approaches to optimize the Fc region function e.g. antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC activity in therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and soluble polypeptides fused to Fc regions have focused on a limited number of single amino acid changes based on structural analysis and or computer aided designs. Alternative approaches in engineering Fc regions have focused on the glycosylation of the Fc region to optimize Fc region function. The validity of using an Fc variant s Ratio of Affinities to assess its therapeutic potential has been suggested with respect to Fc variants whose sequences were derived using computer algorithms to search sequence structure space Lazar G. A. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103 4005 4010 2006 . This approach identified four Fc variants 1 S239D 2 1322E 3 S239D and 1322E and 4 S239D 1332E and A330L all of which bound Fc RIIIa as well as Fc RIIb with greater affinity than wild type Lazar G. A. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103 4005 4010 2006 . In contrast the present invention is based in part on selecting desired variant Fc containing molecules that exhibit an altered Ratio of Affinities for Fc RIII and Fc RII from an unbiased library of Fc variants. This approach enabled the identification of a larger universe of desired Fc variants as well as variants having Ratios of Affinities far in excess of those reported by Lazar G. A. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103 4005 4010 2006 . The present invention encompasses methods for engineering Fc regions and identification and screening of novel Fe variants outside the expected regions identified by structural studies. Expected regions as used herein refer to those regions that based on structural and or biochemical studies are in contact with an Fc ligand.

The therapeutic or prophylactic molecules that are used in accordance with the methods of the invention thus comprise variant Fc regions comprising one or more amino acid modifications that exhibit an altered Ratio of Affinities especially wherein the FC Ris either Fc RIIA or Fc RIIIA and the Fc Ris Fc RIIB. In a preferred embodiment the molecules of the invention further specifically bind Fc RIIB via the Fc region with a lower affinity than a comparable molecule i.e. having the same amino acid sequence as the molecule of the invention except for the one or more amino acid modifications in the Fc region comprising the wild type Fc region binds Fc RIIB. In some embodiments the invention encompasses molecules with variant Fc regions having one or more amino acid modifications which modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA and enhance the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIB relative to a comparable molecule with a wild type Fc region. In other embodiments the invention encompasses molecules with variant Fc regions having one or more amino acid modifications which modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA but do not alter the affinity of the variant Fc regions for Fc RIIB relative to a comparable molecule with a wild type Fc region. A preferred embodiment is a variant Fc region that has enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIA but reduced affinity for Fc RIIB relative to a comparable molecule with a wild type Fc region.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fe modifications including but not limited to modifications that alter effector function. The invention encompasses combining an Fc variant of the invention with other Fe modifications to provide additive synergistic or novel properties in antibodies or Fe fusions. Preferably the Fc variants of the invention enhance the phenotype of the modification with which they are combined. For example if an Fc variant of the invention is combined with a mutant known to bind Fc RIIIA with a higher affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region the combination with a mutant of the invention results in a greater fold enhancement in Fc RIIIA affinity.

In one embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants such as those disclosed in Duncan et al 1988 Nature 332 563 564 Lund et al. 1991 J. Immunol 147 2657 2662 Lund et al 1992 Mol Immunol 29 53 59 Alegre et al 1994 Transplantation 57 1537 1543 Hutchins et al. 1995 Proc Natl.

In certain embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with one or more of the Fc variants i.e. amino acid modifications relative to a wild type Fc region presented in tables 4 5 9 and 10 infra.

The invention encompasses molecules that are homodimers or heterodimers of Fc regions. Heterodimers comprising Fc regions refer to molecules where the two Fc chains have the same or different sequences. In some embodiments in the heterodimeric molecules comprising variant Fc regions each chain has one or more different modifications from the other chain. In other embodiments in the heterodimeric molecules comprising variant Fc regions one chain contains the wild type Fc region and the other chain comprises one or more modifications. Methods of engineering heterodimeric Fc containing molecules are known in the art and encompassed within the invention.

In some embodiments the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region which variant Fc region binds an Fc Rbut does not bind an Fc Ror binds an Fc Rwith a reduced affinity relative to a comparable molecule comprising the wild type Fc region as determined by standard assays e.g. in vitro assays known to one skilled in the art. In an alternative embodiment the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region which variant Fc region binds an Fc R does not bind an Fc Ror binds an FC Rwith reduced affinity relative to a comparable molecule comprising the wild type Fc region as determined by standard assays e.g. in vitro assays known to one skilled in the art. In a specific embodiment the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region which variant Fc region only binds one Fc R wherein said Fc R is Fc IIIA. In another specific embodiment the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region which variant Fc region only binds one Fc R wherein said Fc R is Fc RIIA. In yet another embodiment the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region which variant Fc region only binds one Fc R wherein said Fc R is Fc RIIB.

The affinities and binding properties of the molecules of the invention for an Fc R are initially determined using in vitro assays biochemical or immunological based assays known in the art for determining Fc Fc R interactions i.e. specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc R including but not limited to ELISA assay surface plasmon resonance assay immunoprecipitation assays See Section 6.2 . Preferably the binding properties of the molecules of the invention are also characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more Fc R mediator effector cell functions See Section 6.2.2 .

As used herein the term Fc region is used to define a C terminal region of an IgG heavy chain. Although the boundaries may vary slightly the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is defined to stretch from Cys226 to the carboxy terminus. The Fc region of an IgG comprises two constant domains CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region also referred to as C 2 domain usually extends from amino acid 231 to amino acid 338. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather two N linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG.

Throughout the present specification the numbering of the residues in an IgG heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al. 5Ed. Public Health Service NH1 MD 1991 expressly incorporated herein by references. The EU index as in Kabat refers to the numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.

The hinge region is generally defined as stretching from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1. Hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues forming inter heavy chain S S bonds in the same positions.

As used herein the terms antibody and antibodies refer to monoclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies human antibodies humanized antibodies synthetic antibodies chimeric antibodies polyclonal antibodies camelized antibodies single chain Fvs scFv single chain antibodies Fab fragments F ab fragments disulfide linked bispecific Fvs sdFv intrabodies and anti idiotypic anti Id antibodies including e.g. anti Id and anti anti Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention and epitope binding fragments of any of the above. In particular antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules i.e. molecules that contain an antigen binding site. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD IgA and IgY class e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA or subclass.

As used herein the term variant Fc region is intended to denote an Fc region that has been modified by substitution insertion or deletion of one or more amino acid residues relative to the Fc region of the unmodified molecule i.e. the wild type immunoglobulin . The present invention relates to molecules that possess Fc regions having an altered Ratio of Affinities for an Fc R that activates a cellular effector function i.e. an FC R such as Fc RIIA or Fc RIIIA relative to an Fc R that inhibits a cellular effector function i.e. an Fc R such as Fc RIIB 

Thus for any particular molecule having a variant Fc region the molecule s Ratio of Affinities is determined by calculating the difference in affinity of the variant Fc region of the molecule to an Fc R for example to Fc RIIA or to Fc RIIIA relative to the affinity of a wild type immunoglobulin to such Fc R e.g. Affinityof the variant Fc region Affinityof the wild type immunoglobulin and dividing such difference by the difference in affinity to an Fc R for example Fc RIIB of the variant Fc region of the molecule relative to the affinity of a wild type immunoglobulin to such Fc R e.g. Affinityof the variant Fc region Affinityof the wild type immunoglobulin . An increased Ratio of Affinities may result from the Fc region of the molecule having relative to a wild type Fc an increase in affinity to an FC R for example to Fc RIIA or to Fc RIIIA coupled with either an unchanged affinity to an Fc R for example Fc RIIB or a decrease in affinity to such Fc R. Alternatively an increased Ratio of Affinities may result from the Fc region of such molecule exhibiting an increase in affinity to both an Fc Rand an Fc R relative to a wild type Fc provided that the increase in affinity to the Fc Rexceeds the increase in affinity to the Fc R i.e. binding to the Fc Ris greatly increased compared to binding to the Fc R which is merely increased or may result from the Fc region of such molecule exhibiting a decreased affinity to both an Fc Rand an Fc R relative to a wild type Fc provided that the decrease in affinity to the Fc Ris less than the decrease in affinity to an Fc R i.e. binding to the Fc Ris greatly decreased compared to binding to the Fc R which is merely decreased or may result from an unchanged affinity to an Fc Rcoupled with a decrease in affinity to an Fc R. A decreased Ratio of Affinities may result from the Fc region of the molecule having relative to a wild type Fc a decrease in affinity to an Fc Rcoupled with either an unchanged affinity to an Fc Ror an increase in affinity to an Fc R. Alternatively a decreased Ratio of Affinities may result from the Fc region of such molecule exhibiting a decrease in affinity to both an Fc Rand an Fc R relative to a wild type Fc provided that the decrease in affinity to the Fc Rexceeds the decrease in affinity to the Fc R i.e. binding to the Fc Ris greatly decreased compared to binding to the Fc R which is merely decreased or may result from the Fc region of such molecule exhibiting an increased affinity to both an Fc Rand an Fc R relative to a wild type Fc provided that the increase in affinity to the Fc Ris less than the increase in affinity to the an Fc R i.e. binding to the Fc Ris greatly increased compared to binding to he Fc R which is merely increased or may result from an unchanged affinity to an Fc Rcoupled with an increase in affinity to an Fc R.

As used herein the term derivative in the context of polypeptides or proteins refers to a polypeptide or protein that comprises an amino acid sequence which has been altered by the introduction of amino acid residue substitutions deletions or additions. The term derivative as used herein also refers to a polypeptide or protein which has been modified i.e by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the polypeptide or protein.

In some embodiments the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region having an amino acid modification at one or more of the following positions 119 125 132 133 141 142 147 149 162 166 185 192 202 205 210 214 217 219 215 216 217 218 219 221 222 223 224 225 227 288 229 231 232 233 235 240 241 242 243 244 246 247 248 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 258 261 262 263 268 269 270 272 273 274 275 276 279 280 281 282 284 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 295 298 300 301 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 315 316 317 318 319 320 323 326 327 328 330 333 334 335 337 339 340 343 344 345 347 348 352 353 354 355 358 359 360 361 362 365 366 367 369 370 371 372 375 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 404 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 414 415 416417 419 420 421 422 423 424 427 428 431 433 435 436 438 440 441 442 443 446 447. Preferably such mutations result in molecules that have an altered affinity for an Fc R and or have an altered effector cell mediated function as determined using methods disclosed and exemplified herein and known to one skilled in the art.

The invention encompasses molecules comprising variant Fc regions consisting of or comprising any of the mutations listed in the table below in Table 4.

In yet other embodiments the invention encompasses molecules comprising variant Fc regions having more than two amino acid modifications. A non limiting example of such variants is listed in the table below Table 5 . The invention encompasses mutations listed in Table 5 which further comprise one or more amino acid modifications such as those disclosed herein.

In some embodiments the molecules preferably the immunoglobulins of the invention further comprise one or more glycosylation sites so that one or more carbohydrate moieties are covalently attached to the molecule. Preferably the antibodies of the invention with one or more glycosylation sites and or one or more modifications in the Fc region have an enhanced antibody mediated effector function e.g. enhanced ADCC activity. In some embodiments the invention further comprises antibodies comprising one or more modifications of amino acids that are directly or indirectly known to interact with a carbohydrate moiety of the antibody including but not limited to amino acids at positions 241 243 244 245 245 249 256 258 260 262 264 265 296 299 and 301. Amino acids that directly or indirectly interact with a carbohydrate moiety of an antibody are known in the art see e.g. Jefferis et al. 1995 44 111 7 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The invention encompasses antibodies that have been modified by introducing one or more glycosylation sites into one or more sites of the antibodies preferably without altering the functionality of the antibody e.g. binding activity to Fc R. Glycosylation sites may be introduced into the variable and or constant region of the antibodies of the invention. As used herein glycosylation sites include any specific amino acid sequence in an antibody to which an oligosaccharide i.e. carbohydrates containing two or more simple sugars linked together will specifically and covalently attach. Oligosaccharide side chains are typically linked to the backbone of an antibody via either N or O linkages. N linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of an oligosaccharide moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of an oligosaccharide moiety to a hydroxyamino acid e.g. serine threonine. The antibodies of the invention may comprise one or more glycosylation sites including N linked and O linked glycosylation sites. Any glycosylation site for N linked or O linked glycosylation known in the art may be used in accordance with the instant invention. An exemplary N linked glycosylation site that is useful in accordance with the methods of the present invention is the amino acid sequence Asn X Thr Ser wherein X may be any amino acid and Thr Ser indicates a threonine or a serine. Such a site or sites may be introduced into an antibody of the invention using methods well known in the art to which this invention pertains. See for example J. D. Watson et al. W.H. Freeman and Company New York 1983 chapter 8 pp. 106 116 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. An exemplary method for introducing a glycosylation site into an antibody of the invention may comprise modifying or mutating an amino acid sequence of the antibody so that the desired Asn X Thr Ser sequence is obtained.

In some embodiments the invention encompasses methods of modifying the carbohydrate content of an antibody of the invention by adding or deleting a glycosylation site. Methods for modifying the carbohydrate content of antibodies are well known in the art and encompassed within the invention see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 218 149 EP 0 359 096 B1 U.S. Publication No. US 2002 0028486 WO 03 035835 U.S. Publication No. 2003 0115614 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 218 149 6 472 511 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In other embodiments the invention encompasses methods of modifying the carbohydrate content of an antibody of the invention by deleting one or more endogenous carbohydrate moieties of the antibody. In a specific embodiment the invention encompasses shifting the glycosylation site of the Fc region of an antibody by modifying position 297 e.g. from asparagine to a residue without an available amine group e.g. glutamine and or positions adjacent to 297. In a specific embodiment the invention encompasses modifying position 296 so that position 296 and not position 297 is glycosylated.

It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that aside from amino acid substitutions the present invention contemplates other modifications of the Fc region amino acid sequence in order to generate an Fc region variant with one or more altered properties e.g. altered effector function. The invention contemplates deletion of one or more amino acid residues of the Fc region in order to reduce binding to an Fc R. Preferably no more than 5 no more than 10 no more than 20 no more than 30 no more than 50 Fc region residues will be deleted according to this embodiment of the invention. The Fc region herein comprising one or more amino acid deletions will preferably retain at least about 80 and preferably at least about 90 and most preferably at least about 95 of the wild type Fc region. In some embodiments one or more properties of the molecules are maintained such as for example non immunogenicity Fc RIIIA binding Fc RIIA binding or a combination of these properties.

In alternate embodiments the invention encompasses amino acid insertion to generate the Fc region variants which variants have altered properties including altered effector function. In one specific embodiment the invention encompasses introducing at least one amino acid residue for example one to two amino acid residues and preferably no more than 10 amino acid residues adjacent to one or more of the Fe region positions identified herein. In alternate embodiments the invention further encompasses introducing at least one amino acid residue for example one to two amino acid residues and preferably no more than 10 amino acid residues adjacent to one or more of the Fc region positions known in the art as impacting Fc R interaction and or binding.

The invention further encompasses incorporation of unnatural amino acids to generate the Fc variants of the invention. Such methods are known to those skilled in the art such as those using the natural biosynthetic machinery to allow incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins see e.g. Wang et al. 2002 Chem. Comm. 1 1 11 Wang et al. 2001 Science 292 498 500 van Hest et al. 2001. Chem. Comm. 19 1897 1904 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternative strategies focus on the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of amino acyl tRNA see e.g. Tang et al. 2001 J. Am. Chem. 123 44 11089 11090 Kiick et al. 2001 FEBS Lett. 505 3 465 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The affinities and binding properties of the Fc variants or fragments thereof of use in the invention are initially determined using a yeast display system preferably combined with in vitro assays biochemical or immunological based assays known in the art for determining Fc Fc R interactions i.e. specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc R including but not limited to ELISA assay surface plasmon resonance assay immunoprecipitation assays See Section 6.2.1 . In certain embodiments candidate Fe variants identified using the yeast display system are further incorporated into an antibody or fragment thereof for testing in said in vitro assay. Preferably the binding properties of the molecules of the invention are also characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more Fc R mediator effector cell functions See Section 6.2.5 . Such methods have previously been disclosed by the inventors see e.g. U.S Patent Application Publications 2005 0037000 and 2005 0064514 and International Patent Application Publication WO 04 063351 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and have been used to identify and characterize novel Fe mutations based on binding characteristics to Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB see e.g. Table 6.

In most preferred embodiments the molecules of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models such as those disclosed herein and or known in the art as those in in vitro based assays. However the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo. A representative flow chart of the screening and characterization of molecules of the invention is described in .

The invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region that binds with a greater affinity to one or more Fc Rs. Such molecules preferably mediate effector function more effectively as discussed infra. In other embodiments the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region that bind with a weaker affinity to one or more Fc Rs. Reduction or elimination of effector function is desirable in certain cases for example in the case of antibodies whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing a target antigen. Reduction or elimination of effector function would be desirable in cases of autoimmune disease where one would block Fc R activating receptors in effector cells This type of function would be present in the host cells . In general increased effector function would be directed to tumor and foreign cells.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fe modifications including but not limited to modifications that alter effector function. The invention encompasses combining an Fc variant of the invention with other Fe modifications to provide additive synergistic or novel properties in antibodies or Fe fusions. Preferably the Fc variants of the invention enhance the phenotype of the modification with which they are combined. For example if an Fc variant of the invention is combined with a mutant known to bind Fc RIIIA with a higher affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region the combination with a mutant of the invention results in a greater fold enhancement in Fe RIIIA affinity.

In one embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants such as those disclosed in Duncan et al 1988 Nature 332 563 564 Lund et al. 1991 J. Immunol. 147 2657 2662 Lund et al 1992 Mol Immunol 29 53 59 Alegre et al 1994 Transplantation 57 1537 1543 Hutchins et al. 1995 Proc Natl.

In some embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention are incorporated into an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises one or more engineered glycoforms i.e. a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to a molecule comprising an Fc region wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent molecule comprising an Fc region. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method known to one skilled in the art for example by using engineered or variant expression strains by co expression with one or more enzymes for example DI N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnTI11 by expressing a molecule comprising an Fc region in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms or by modifying carbohydrate s after the molecule comprising Fc region has been expressed. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art and include but are not limited to those described in Umana et al 1999 Nat. Biotechnol 17 176 180 Davies et al. 20017 Biotechnol Bioeng 74 288 294 Shields et al 2002 J Biol Chem 277 26733 26740 Shinkawa et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278 3466 3473 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 U.S. Ser.

GlycoMAb glycosylation engineering technology GLYCART biotechnology AG Zurich Switzerland each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. See e.g. WO 00061739 EA01229125 US 20030115614 Okazaki et al. 2004 JMB 336 1239 49 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be optimized for a variety of properties. Properties that may be optimized include but are not limited to enhanced or reduced affinity for an Fc R enhanced or reduced effector function. In a preferred embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to possess enhanced affinity for a human activating Fc R preferably Fc R Fc RIIA Fc RIIc Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIIB most preferably Fc RIIIA. In an alternate preferred embodiment the Fc variants are optimized to possess reduced affinity for the human inhibitory receptor Fc RIIB. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans for example enhanced effector function and greater anti cancer potency as described and exemplified herein. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced tumor elimination in mouse xenograft tumor models.

In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to have reduced affinity for a human Fc R including but not limited to Fc RI Fc RIIA Fc RIIB Fc RIIc Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIIB. These embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans for example reduced effector function and reduced toxicity.

In alternate embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention possess enhanced or reduced affinity for Fc Rs from non human organisms including but not limited to mice rats rabbits and monkeys. Fc variants that are optimized for binding to a non human Fc R may find use in experimentation. For example mouse models are available for a variety of diseases that enable testing of properties such as efficacy toxicity and pharmacokinetics for a given drug candidate. As is known in the art cancer cells can be grafted or injected into mice to mimic a human cancer a process referred to as xenografting. Testing of antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse Fc Rs may provide valuable information with regard to the efficacy of the antibody or Fc fusion its mechanism of action and the like. In certain embodiments molecules of the invention comprising a variant human Fc region are tested in transgenic mice expressing one or more human Fc receptors e.g. Fc RIIIA Fc RIIA Fc RIIB .

While it is preferred to alter binding to an Fc R the instant invention further contemplates Fc variants with altered binding affinity to the neonatal receptor FcRn . Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action Fc region variants with improved affinity for FcRn are anticipated to have longer serum half lives and such molecules will have useful applications in methods of treating mammals where long half life of the administered polypeptide is desired e.g. to treat a chronic disease or disorder. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action Fc region variants with decreased FcRn binding affinity on the contrary are expected to have shorter half lives and such molecules may for example be administered to a mammal where a shortened circulation time may be advantageous e.g. for in vivo diagnostic imaging or for polypeptides which have toxic side effects when left circulating in the blood stream for extended periods. Fc region variants with decreased FcRn binding affinity are anticipated to be less likely to cross the placenta and thus may be utilized in the treatment of diseases or disorders in pregnant women.

In other embodiments these variants may be combined with other known Fc modifications with altered FcRn affinity such as those disclosed in International Publication Nos. WO 98 23289 and WO 97 34631 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 277 375 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The invention encompasses any other method known in the art for generating antibodies having an increased half life in vivo for example by introducing one or more amino acid modifications i.e. substitutions insertions or deletions into an IgG constant domain or FcRn binding fragment thereof preferably a Fc or hinge Fc domain fragment . See e.g. International Publication Nos. WO 98 23289 and WO 97 34631 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 277 375 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety to be used in combination with the Fc variants of the invention. Further antibodies of the invention can be conjugated to albumin in order to make the antibody or antibody fragment more stable in vivo or have a longer half life in vivo. The techniques well known in the art see e.g. International Publication Nos. WO 93 15199 WO 93 15200 and WO 01 77137 and European Patent No. EP 413 622 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The variant s described herein may be subjected to further modifications often times depending on the intended use of the variant. Such modifications may involve further alteration of the amino acid sequence substitution insertion and or deletion of amino acid residues fusion to heterologous polypeptide s and or covalent modifications. Such further modifications may be made prior to simultaneously with or following the amino acid modification s disclosed herein which results in altered properties such as an alteration of Fc receptor binding and or ADCC activity.

Alternatively or additionally the invention encompasses combining the amino acid modifications disclosed herein with one or more further amino acid modifications that alter C1q binding and or complement dependent cytoxicity function of the Fc region as determined in vitro and or in vivo. Preferably the starting molecule of particular interest herein is usually one that binds to C1q and displays complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . The further amino acid substitutions described herein will generally serve to alter the ability of the starting molecule to bind to C1q and or modify its complement dependent cytotoxicity function e.g. to reduce and preferably abolish these effector functions. In other embodiments molecules comprising substitutions at one or more of the described positions with improved C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function are contemplated herein. For example the starting molecule may be unable to bind C1q and or mediate CDC and may be modified according to the teachings herein such that it acquires these further effector functions. Moreover molecules with preexisting C1q binding activity optionally further having the ability to mediate CDC may be modified such that one or both of these activities are altered e.g. enhanced. In some embodiments the invention encompasses variant Fc regions with altered CDC activity without any alteration in C1q binding. In yet other embodiments the invention encompasses variant Fc regions with altered CDC activity and altered C1q binding.

To generate an Fc region with altered C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function the amino acid positions to be modified are generally selected from positions 270 322 326 327 329 331 333 and 334 where the numbering of the residues in an IgG heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 199 . These amino acid modifications may be combined with one or more Fc modifications disclosed herein to provide a synergistic or additive effect on C1q binding and or CDC activity. In other embodiments the invention encompasses Fc variants with altered C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function comprising an amino acid substitution at position 396 with leucine and at position 255 with leucine or an amino acid substitution at position 396 with leucine and at position 419 with histidine an amino acid substitution at position 396 with leucine and at position 370 with glutamic acid an amino acid substitution at position 396 with leucine and at position 240 with alanine an amino acid substitution at position 396 with leucine and at position 392 with threonine an amino acid substitution at position 247 with leucine and at position 421 with lysine. The invention encompasses any known modification of the Fc region which alters C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function such as those disclosed in Idusogie et al. 2001166 4 2571 5 Idusogie et al. 2000 164 8 4178 4184 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In specific embodiments the invention encompasses variant Fc regions with improved C1q binding and improved Fc RIII binding e.g. having both improved ADCC activity and improved CDC activity. In alternative embodiments the invention encompasses a variant Fc region with reduced CDC activity and or reduced ADCC activity. In other embodiments one may increase only one of these activities and optionally also reduce the other activity e.g. to generate an Fc region variant with improved ADCC activity but reduced CDC activity and vice versa.

Examples of such Fc variants previously identified by the authors are provided in Tables 7 and 8 infra.

In some embodiments the immunoglobulins of the invention with enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA have at least 2 fold at least 4 fold at least 8 fold at least 10 fold higher phagocytosis activity relative to an immunoglobulin comprising a wild type Fc region.

In a specific embodiment the invention encompasses an immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region with one or more amino acid modifications with an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA such that the immunoglobulin has an enhanced effector function e.g. antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or phagocytosis. In a specific embodiment the one or more amino acid modifications which increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA and increase the ADCC activity of the immunoglobulin comprise a substitution at position 379 with methionine or a substitution at position 243 with isoleucine and at position 379 with leucine or a substitution at position 288 with asparagine at position 330 with serine and at position 396 with leucine or a substitution at position 243 leucine and at position 255 with leucine or a substitution at position 334 with glutamic acid at position 359 with asparagine and at position 366 with serine or a substitution at position 288 with methionine and at position 334 with glutamic acid or a substitution at position 334 with glutamic acid and at position 292 with leucine or a substitution at position 316 with aspartic acid at position 378 with valine and at position 399 with glutamic acid or a substitution at position 315 with isoleucine at position 379 with methionine and at position 399 with glutamic acid or a substitution at position 243 with isoleucine at position 379 with leucine and at position 420 with valine or a substitution at position 247 with leucine and at position 421 with lysine or a substitution at position 248 with methionine or a substitution at position 392 with threonine and at position 396 with leucine or a substitution at position 293 with valine at position 295 with glutamic acid and at position 327 with threonine or a substitution at position 268 with asapragine and at position 396 with leucine or a substitution at position 319 with phenylalanine at position 352 with leucine and at position 396 with leucine or a substitution at position 243 with leucine at position 292 with proline at position 300 with leucine at position 305 with isoleucine and at position 396 with leucine or a substitution at position 243 with leucine at position 292 with proline at position 300 with leucine and at position 396 with leucine or a substitution at position 243 with leucine at position 292 with proline and at position 300 with leucine.

In another specific embodiment the one or more amino acid modifications which increase the ADCC activity of the immunoglobulin is any of the mutations listed below in table 9.

Alternatively or additionally it may be useful to combine the above amino acid modifications or any other amino acid modifications disclosed herein with one or more further amino acid modifications that alter C1q binding and or complement dependent cytoxicity function of the Fc region. The starting molecule of particular interest herein is usually one that binds to C1q and displays complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . The further amino acid substitutions described herein will generally serve to alter the ability of the starting molecule to bind to C1q and or modify its complement dependent cytotoxicity function e.g. to reduce and preferably abolish these effector functions. However molecules comprising substitutions at one or more of the described positions with improved C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function are contemplated herein. For example the starting molecule may be unable to bind C1q and or mediate CDC and may be modified according to the teachings herein such that it acquires these further effector functions. Moreover molecules with preexisting C1q binding activity optionally further having the ability to mediate CDC may be modified such that one or both of these activities are enhanced.

As disclosed above one can design an Fc region with altered effector function e.g. by modifying C1q binding and or FcR binding and thereby changing CDC activity and or ADCC activity. For example one can generate a variant Fc region with improved C1q binding and improved Fc RIII binding e.g. having both improved ADCC activity and improved CDC activity. Alternatively where one desires that effector function be reduced or ablated one may engineer a variant Fc region with reduced CDC activity and or reduced ADCC activity. In other embodiments one may increase only one of these activities and optionally also reduce the other activity e.g. to generate an Fc region variant with improved ADCC activity but reduced CDC activity and vice versa.

The invention encompasses specific variants of the Fc region that have been identified using the methods of the invention from a yeast library of mutants after 2nd 4th round of sorting are listed in Table 10. Table 10 summarizes the various mutants that were identified using the methods of the invention. The mutants were assayed using an ELISA assay for determining binding to Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB. The mutants were also tested in an ADCC assay by cloning the Fc variants into a ch 4 4 20 antibody using methods disclosed and exemplified herein. Bolded items refer to experiments in which the ch4 4 20 were purified prior the ADCC assay. The antibody concentration used was in the range 0.5 g mL 1.0 g mL.

In preferred embodiments the invention provides modified immunoglobulin molecules e.g. antibodies with variant Fc regions having one or more amino acid modifications which one or more amino acid modifications increase the affinity of the molecule for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA. Such immunoglobulins include IgG molecules that naturally contain Fc R binding regions e.g. Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIB binding region or immunoglobulin derivatives that have been engineered to contain an Fc R binding region e.g. Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIB binding region . The modified immunoglobulins of the invention include any immunoglobulin molecule that binds preferably immunospecifically i.e. competes off non specific binding as determined by immunoassays well known in the art for assaying specific antigen antibody binding an antigen and contains an Fc R binding region e.g. a FC RIIIA and or Fc RIIB binding region . Such antibodies include but are not limited to polyclonal monoclonal bi specific multi specific human humanized chimeric antibodies single chain antibodies Fab fragments F ab fragments disulfide linked Fvs and fragments containing either a VL or VH domain or even a complementary determining region CDR that specifically binds an antigen in certain cases engineered to contain or fused to an Fe R binding region.

In some embodiments the molecules of the invention comprise portions of an Fc region. As used herein the term portion of an Fc region refers to fragments of the Fc region preferably a portion with effector activity and or Fc R binding activity or a comparable region of a mutant lacking such activity . The fragment of an Fc region may range in size from 5 amino acids to the entire Fc region minus one amino acid. The portion of an Fc region may be missing up to 10 up to 20 up to 30 amino acids from the N terminus or C terminus.

The IgG molecules of the invention are preferably IgG1 subclass of IgGs but may also be any other IgG subclasses of given animals. For example in humans the IgG class includes IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4 and mouse IgG includes IgG1 IgG2a IgG2b IgG2c and IgG3.

The immunoglobulins and other polypeptides used herein may be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably the antibodies are human rodent e.g. mouse and rat donkey sheep rabbit goat guinea pig camel horse or chicken. As used herein human antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulin and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins as described infra and for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 939 598 by Kucherlapati et al.

The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific bispecific trispecific or of greater multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of a polypeptide or may be specific for heterologous epitopes such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material. See e.g. PCT publications WO 93 17715 WO 92 08802 WO 91 00360 WO 92 05793 Tutt et al. 147 60 69 1991 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 474 893 4 714 681 4 925 648 5 573 920 5 601 819 Kostelny et al. 148 1547 1553 1992.

Multispecific antibodies have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. While such molecules normally will only bind two antigens i.e. bispecific antibodies BsAbs antibodies with additional specificities such as trispecific antibodies are encompassed by the instant invention. Examples of BsAbs include without limitation those with one arm directed against a tumor cell antigen and the other arm directed against a cytotoxic molecule.

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Millstein et al. Nature 305 537 539 1983 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. EMBO J. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. Methods in Enzymology 121 210 1986 . According to another approach described in WO96 27011 a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. See e.g. Tutt et al. J. Immunol. 147 60 1991 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are otherwise modified i.e. by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from binding antigen and or generating an anti idiotypic response. For example but not by way of limitation the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified e.g. by glycosylation acetylation pegylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage acetylation formylation metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin etc. Additionally the derivative may contain one or more non classical amino acids.

For some uses including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays it may be preferable to use chimeric humanized or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a constant region derived from a human immunoglobulin. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g. Morrison 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. 4 214 1986 Gillies et al. 125 191 202 1989 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 807 715 4 816 567 and 4 816 397 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non human species that bind the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from the non human species and framework regions and constant domains from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See e.g. Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 Riechmann et al. 332 323 1988 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including for example CDR grafting EP 239 400 PCT publication WO 91 09967 U.S. Pat.

6.2 Screening of Molecules with Variant Fc Regions for Enhanced Fc RIII Binding and Characterization of Same

In preferred embodiments screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc R affinities e.g. enhanced Fc RIIIA affinity are done using the yeast display technology in combination with one or more biochemical based assays preferably in a high throughput manner as described herein or as disclosed in U.S Patent Application Publications 2005 0037000 and 2005 0064514 and International Patent Application Publication WO 04 063351 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The one or more biochemical assays can be any assay known in the art for identifying Fc Fc R interaction i.e. specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc R including but not limited to an ELISA assay surface plasmon resonance assays immunoprecipitation assay affinity chromatography and equilibrium dialysis. In some embodiments screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc R affinities e.g. enhanced Fc RIIIA affinity are done using the yeast display technology as described herein in combination with one or more functional based assays preferably in a high throughput manner. The functional based assays can be any assay known in the art for characterizing one or more Fc R mediated effector cell functions such as those described herein in Section 6.2.7. Non limiting examples of effector cell functions that can be used in accordance with the methods of the invention include but are not limited to antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC antibody dependent phagocytosis phagocytosis opsonization opsonophagocytosis cell binding rosetting C1q binding and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. In some embodiments screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc R affinities e.g. enhanced Fc RIIIA affinity are done using the yeast display technology as described herein in combination with one or more biochemical based assays in combination or in parallel with one or more functional based assays preferably in a high throughput manner.

The term specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc R refers to an interaction of the Fc region and a particular Fc R which has an affinity constant of at least about 150 nM in the case of monomeric Fc RIIIA and at least about 60 nM in the case of dimeric Fc RIIB as determined using for example an ELISA or surface plasmon resonance assay e.g. a BIAcore . The affinity constant of an Fc region for monomeric Fc RIIIA may be 150 nM 200 nM or 300 nM. The affinity constant of an Fc region for dimeric Fc RIIB may be 60 nM 80 nM 90 nM or 100 nM. Dimeric Fc RIIB for use in the methods of the invention may be generated using methods known to one skilled in the art. Typically the extracellular region of Fc RIIB is covalently linked to a heterologous polypeptide which is capable of dimerization so that the resulting fusion protein is a dimer e.g. see U.S. Application No. 60 439 709 filed on Jan. 13 2003 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A specific interaction generally is stable under physiological conditions including for example conditions that occur in a living individual such as a human or other vertebrate or invertebrate as well as conditions that occur in a cell culture such conditions as used for maintaining and culturing mammalian cells or cells from another vertebrate organism or an invertebrate organism.

In a specific embodiment screening for and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions and altered Fc R affinities comprise displaying the molecule comprising a variant Fc region on the yeast surface and characterizing the binding of the molecule comprising the variant Fc region to a Fc R one or more using a biochemical assay for determining Fc Fc R interaction preferably an ELISA based assay. Once the molecule comprising a variant Fc region has been characterized for its interaction with one or more Fc Rs and determined to have an altered affinity for one or more Fc Rs by at least one biochemical based assay e.g. an ELISA assay the molecule maybe engineered into a complete immunoglobulin using standard recombinant DNA technology methods known in the art and the immunoglobulin comprising the variant Fc region expressed in mammalian cells for further biochemical characterization. The immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention is introduced e.g. replacing the Fc region of the immunoglobulin can be any immunoglobulin including but not limited to polyclonal antibodies monoclonal antibodies bispecific antibodies multi specific antibodies humanized antibodies and chimeric antibodies. In preferred embodiments a variant Fc region is introduced into an immunoglobulin specific for a cell surface receptor a tumor antigen or a cancer antigen.

The present invention encompasses engineering methods to generate Fc variants including but not limited to computational design strategies library generation methods and experimental production and screening methods. These strategies may be applied individually or in various combinations to engineer the Fc variants of the instant invention.

In most preferred embodiments the engineering methods of the invention comprise methods in which amino acids at the interface between an Fc region and the Fc ligand are not modified. Fc ligands include but are not limited to Fc Rs C1q FcRn C3 mannose receptor protein A protein G mannose receptor and undiscovered molecules that bind Fc. Amino acids at the interface between an Fc region and an Fc ligand is defined as those amino acids that make a direct and or indirect contact between the Fc region and the ligand play a structural role in determining the conformation of the interface or are within at least 3 angstroms preferably at least 2 angstroms of each other as determined by structural analysis such as x ray crystallography and molecular modeling. The amino acids at the interface between an Fc region and an Fc ligand include those amino acids that make a direct contact with an Fc R based on crystallographic and structural analysis of Fc Fc R interactions such as those disclosed by Sondermann et al. 2000 Nature 406 267 273 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with Fc R are amino acids 234 239 hinge region amino acids 265 269 B C loop amino acids 297 299 C E loop and amino acids 327 332 F G loop. In some embodiments the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprise modification of at least one residue that does not make a direct contact with an Fc R based on structural and crystallographic analysis e.g. is not within the Fc Fc R binding site.

Preferably the engineering methods of the invention do not modify any of the amino acids as identified by Shields et al. which are located in the CH2 domain of an Fc region proximal to the hinge region e.g. Leu234 Pro238 Ala327 Pro329 and affect binding of an Fc region to all human Fc Rs.

In other embodiments the invention encompasses Fc variants with altered Fc R affinities and or altered effector functions such that the Fc variant does not have an amino acid modification at a position at the interface between an Fc region and the Fc ligand. Preferably such Fc variants in combination with one or more other amino acid modifications which are at the interface between an Fc region and the Fc ligand have a further impact on the particular altered property e.g. altered Fc R affinity. Modifying amino acids at the interface between Fc and an Fc ligand may be done using methods known in the art for example based on structural analysis of Fc ligand complexes. For example but not by way of limitation by exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Fc positions that impact the binding interface variants can be engineered that sample new interface conformations some of which may improve binding to the Fc ligand some of which may reduce Fc ligand binding and some of which may have other favorable properties. Such new interface conformations could be the result of for example direct interaction with Fc ligand residues that form the interface or indirect effects caused by the amino acid modifications such as perturbation of side chain or backbone conformations

The invention encompasses engineering Fc variants comprising any of the amino acid modifications disclosed herein in combination with other modifications in which the conformation of the Fc carbohydrate at position 297 is altered. The invention encompasses conformational and compositional changes in the N297 carbohydrate that result in a desired property for example increased or reduced affinity for an Fc R. Such modifications may further enhance the phenotype of the original amino acid modification of the Fc variants of the invention. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of actions such a strategy is supported by the observation that the carbohydrate structure and conformation dramatically affect Fc Fc R and Fc C1q binding Umaha et al. 1999 Nat Biotechnol 17 176 180 Davies et al. 2001 Biotechnol Bioeng 74 288 294 Mimura et al. 2001 J Biol Chem 276 45539 Radaev et al. 2001 J Biol Chem 276 16478 16483 Shields et al. 2002 J Biol Chem 277 26733 26740 Shinkawa et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278 3466 3473 .

Another design strategy for generating Fc variants in accordance with the invention is provided in which the Fc region is reengineered to eliminate the structural and functional dependence on glycosylation. This design strategy involves the optimization of Fc structure stability solubility and or Fc function for example affinity of Fc for one or more Fc ligands in the absence of the N297 carbohydrate. In one approach positions that are exposed to solvent in the absence of glycosylation are engineered such that they are stable structurally consistent with Fc structure and have no tendency to aggregate. Approaches for optimizing aglycosylated Fc may involve but are not limited to designing amino acid modifications that enhance aglycoslated Fe stability and or solubility by incorporating polar and or charged residues that face inward towards the Cg2 Cg2 dimer axis and by designing amino acid modifications that directly enhance the aglycosylated Fc Fc R interface or the interface of aglycosylated Fc with some other Fc ligand.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fc modifications including but not limited to modifications that alter effector function. The invention encompasses combining an Fc variant of the invention with other Fc modifications to provide additive synergistic or novel properties in antibodies or Fc fusions. Such modifications may be in the CH1 CH2 or CH3 domains or a combination thereof. Preferably the Fc variants of the invention enhance the property of the modification with which they are combined. For example if an Fc variant of the invention is combined with a mutant known to bind Fc RIIIA with a higher affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region the combination with a mutant of the invention results in a greater fold enhancement in Fc RIIIA affinity.

In one embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants such as those disclosed in Duncan et al 1988 Nature 332 563 564 Lund et al. 1991 J. Immunol. 147 2657 2662 Lund et al 1992 Mol Immunol 29 53 59 Alegre et al 1994 Transplantation 57 1537 1543 Hutchins et al. 1995 Proc Natl.

Nos. 5 624 821 5 885 573 6 194 551 PCT WO 00 42072 PCT WO 99 58572 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The invention encompasses characterization of the molecules of the invention e.g. an antibody comprising a variant Fc region identified by the yeast display technology and Fc R Fc binding assays disclosed in U.S Patent Application Publications 2005 0037000 and 2005 0064514 and International Patent Application Publication WO 04 063351 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies engineered according to the methods of the invention using assays known to those skilled in the art for identifying the effector cell function of the molecules. In particular the invention encompasses characterizing the molecules of the invention for Fc R mediated effector cell function. Examples of effector cell functions that can be assayed in accordance with the invention include but are not limited to antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity phagocytosis opsonization opsonophagocytosis C1q binding and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Any cell based or cell free assay known to those skilled in the art for determining effector cell function activity can be used For effector cell assays see Perussia et al. 2000121 179 92 Baggiolini et al. 1998 44 10 841 8 Lehmann et al. 2000 243 1 2 229 42 Brown E J. 199445 147 64 Munn et al. 1990 172 231 237 Abdul Majid et al. 2002 55 70 81 Ding et al. 19988 403 411 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

In one embodiment the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc R mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes. Alternatively the Fc R mediated phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention may be assayed in other phagocytes e.g. neutrophils polymorphonuclear leuckocytes PMN human peripheral blood monocytes monocyte derived macrophages which can be obtained using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art e.g. see Brown E J. 199445 147 164 . In one embodiment the function of the molecules of the invention is characterized by measuring the ability of THP 1 cells to phagocytose fluoresceinated IgG opsonized sheep red blood cells SRBC by methods previously described Tridandapani et al. 2000275 20480 7 . For example an exemplary assay for measuring phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions with enhanced affinities for Fc RIIIA comprises of treating THP 1 cells with a molecule of the invention or with a control antibody that does not bind to Fc RIIIA comparing the activity levels of said cells wherein a difference in the activities of the cells e.g. resetting activity the number of THP 1 cells binding IgG coated SRBC adherence activity the total number of SRBC bound to THP 1 cells and phagocytic rate would indicate the functionality of the molecule of the invention. It can be appreciated by one skilled in the art that this exemplary assay can be used to assay any of the molecules identified by the methods of the invention.

Another exemplary assay for determining the phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention is an antibody dependent opsonophagocytosis assay ADCP which can comprise the following coating a target bioparticle such as labeled FITC Molecular Probes or FITC with i wild type 4 4 20 antibody an antibody to fluorescein See Bedzyk et al 1989264 3 1565 1569 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as the control antibody for Fc R dependent ADCP or ii 4 4 20 antibody harboring the D265A mutation that knocks out binding to Fc RIII as a background control for Fc R dependent ADCP iii 4 4 20 antibody carrying variant Fc regions identified by the methods of the invention and produced as exemplified in Example 7.6 and forming the opsonized particle adding any of the osponized particles described i iii to THP 1 effector cells a monocytic cell line available from ATCC in a 60 1 ratio to allow Fc R mediated phagocytosis to occur preferably incubating the cells and FITC antibody at 37 C. for 1.5 hour adding trypan blue after incubation preferably at room temperature for 2 3 min. to the cells to quench the fluorescence of the bacteria that are adhered to the outside of the cell surface without being internalized transferring cells into a FACS buffer e.g. 0.1 BSA in PBS 0.1 sodium azide analyzing the fluorescence of the THP1 cells using FACS e.g. BD FACS Calibur . Preferably the THP 1 cells used in the assay are analyzed by FACS for expression of Fc R on the cell surface. THP 1 cells express both CD32A and CD64. CD64 is a high affinity Fc R that is blocked in conducting the ADCP assay in accordance with the methods of the invention. The THP 1 cells are preferably blocked with 100 g mL soluble IgG1 or 10 human serum. To analyze the extent of ADCP the gate is preferably set on THP 1 cells and median fluorescence intensity is measured. The ADCP activity for individual mutants is calculated and reported as a normalized value to the wild type chMab 4 4 20 obtained. The opsonized particles are added to THP 1 cells such that the ratio of the opsonized particles to THP 1 cells is 30 1 or 60 1. In most preferred embodiments the ADCP assay is conducted with controls such as FITC in medium FITC and THP 1 cells to serve as Fc R independent ADCP activity FITC THP 1 cells and wild type 4 4 20 antibody to serve as Fc R dependent ADCP activity FITC THP 1 cells 4 4 20 D265A to serve as the background control for Fc R dependent ADCP activity .

In another embodiment the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc R mediated ADCC activity in effector cells e.g. natural killer cells using any of the standard methods known to those skilled in the art See e.g. Perussia et al. 2000121 179 92 . An exemplary assay for determining ADCC activity of the molecules of the invention is based on a Cr release assay comprising of labeling target cells with Cr NaCrO this cell membrane permeable molecule is commonly used for labeling since it binds cytoplasmic proteins and although spontaneously released from the cells with slow kinetics it is released massively following target cell necrosis osponizing the target cells with the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions combining the opsonized radiolabeled target cells with effector cells in a microtitre plate at an appropriate ratio of target cells to effector cells incubating the mixture of cells for 16 18 hours at 37 C. collecting supernatants and analyzing radioactivity. The cytotoxicity of the molecules of the invention can then be determined for example using the following formula lysis experimental cpm target leak cpm detergent lysis cpm target leak cpm 100 . Alternatively lysis ADCC AICC maximum release spontaneous release . Specific lysis can be calculated using the formula specific lysis lysis with the molecules of the invention lysis in the absence of the molecules of the invention. A graph can be generated by varying either the target effector cell ratio or antibody concentration.

In yet another embodiment the molecules of the invention are characterized for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC see e.g. Ding et al 1998 8 403 11 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Preferably the effector cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention are peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC that are preferably purified from normal human blood using standard methods known to one skilled in the art e.g. using Ficoll Paque density gradient centrifugation. Preferred effector cells for use in the methods of the invention express different Fe R activating receptors. The invention encompasses effector cells THP 1 expressing Fc RI Fc RIIA and Fc RIIB and monocyte derived primary macrophages derived from whole human blood expressing both Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB to determine if Fc antibody mutants show increased ADCC activity and phagocytosis relative to wild type IgG1 antibodies.

The human monocyte cell line THP 1 activates phagocytosis through expression of the high affinity receptor Fc RI and the low affinity receptor Fc RIIA Fleit et al. 1991 J. Leuk. Biol. 49 556 . THP 1 cells do not constitutively express Fc RIIA or Fc RIIB. Stimulation of these cells with cytokines effects the FcR expression pattern Pricop et al. 2000 J. Immunol. 166 531 7 . Growth of THP 1 cells in the presence of the cytokine IL4 induces Fc RIIB expression and causes a reduction in Fc RIIA and Fc RI expression. Fc RIIB expression can also be enhanced by increased cell density Tridandapani et al. 2002277 5082 9 . In contrast it has been reported that IFN can lead to expression of Fc RIIIA Pearse et al. 1993 90 4314 8 . The presence or absence of receptors on the cell surface can be determined by FACS using common methods known to one skilled in the art. Cytokine induced expression of Fc R on the cell surface provides a system to test both activation and inhibition in the presence of Fc RIIB. If THP 1 cells are unable to express the Fc RIIB the invention also encompasses another human monocyte cell line U937. These cells have been shown to terminally differentiate into macrophages in the presence of IFN and TNF Koren et al. 1979279 328 331 .

Fc R dependent tumor cell killing is mediated by macrophage and NK cells in mouse tumor models Clynes et al. 199895 652 656 . The invention encompasses the use of elutriated monocytes from donors as effector cells to analyze the efficiency Fc mutants to trigger cell cytotoxicity of target cells in both phagocytosis and ADCC assays. Expression patterns of Fc RI Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB are affected by different growth conditions. Fc R expression from frozen elutriated monocytes fresh elutriated monocytes monocytes maintained in 10 FBS and monocytes cultured in FBS GM CSF and or in human serum may be determined using common methods known to those skilled in the art. For example cells can be stained with Fc R specific antibodies and analyzed by FACS to determine FcR profiles. Conditions that best mimic macrophage in vivo Fc R expression is then used for the methods of the invention.

In some embodiments the invention encompasses the use of mouse cells especially when human cells with the right Fc R profiles are unable to be obtained. In some embodiments the invention encompasses the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 ATCC which can be transfected with human Fc RIIIA and stable transfectants isolated using methods known in the art see e.g. Ralph et al J. 119 950 4 . Transfectants can be quantitated for Fc RIIIA expression by FACS analysis using routine experimentation and high expressors can be used in the ADCC assays of the invention. In other embodiments the invention encompasses isolation of spleen peritoneal macrophage expressing human Fc R from knockout transgenic mice such as those disclosed herein.

Lymphocytes may be harvested from peripheral blood of donors PBM using a Ficoll Paque gradient Pharmacia . Within the isolated mononuclear population of cells the majority of the ADCC activity occurs via the natural killer cells NK containing Fc RIIIA but not Fc RIIB on their surface. Results with these cells indicate the efficacy of the mutants on triggering NK cell ADCC and establish the reagents to test with elutriated monocytes.

Target cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention include but are not limited to breast cancer cell lines e.g. SK BR 3 with ATCC accession number HTB 30 see e.g. Tremp et al. 197633 41 B lymphocytes cells derived from Burkitts lymphoma e.g. Raji cells with ATCC accession number CCL 86 see e.g. Epstein et al. 196534 231 240 and Daudi cells with ATCC accession number CCL 213 see e.g. Klein et al. 196828 1300 10 . The target cells must be recognized by the antigen binding site of the immunoglobulin to be assayed.

The ADCC assay is based on the ability of NK cells to mediate cell death via an apoptotic pathway. NK cells mediate cell death in part by Fc RIIIA s recognition of IgG bound to an antigen on a cell surface. The ADCC assays used in accordance with the methods of the invention may be radioactive based assays or fluorescence based assays. The ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprises labeling target cells e.g. SK BR 3 MCF 7 OVCAR3 Raji Daudi cells opsonizing target cells with an antibody that recognizes a cell surface receptor on the target cell via its antigen binding site combining the labeled opsonized target cells and the effector cells at an appropriate ratio which can be determined by routine experimentation harvesting the cells detecting the label in the supernatant of the lysed target cells using an appropriate detection scheme based on the label used. The target cells may be labeled either with a radioactive label or a fluorescent label using standard methods known in the art. For example the labels include but are not limited to Cr NaCrO and the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand 2 2 6 2 terpyridine 6 6 dicarboxylate TDA .

In a specific preferred embodiment a time resolved fluorimetric assay is used for measuring ADCC activity against target cells that have been labeled with the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand 2 2 6 2 terpyridine 6 6 dicarboxylate TDA . Such fluorimetric assays are known in the art e.g. see Blomberg et al. 1996193 199 206 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly target cells are labeled with the membrane permeable acetoxymethyl diester of TDA bis acetoxymethyl 2 2 6 2 terpyridine 6 6 dicarboxylate BATDA which rapidly diffuses across the cell membrane of viable cells. Intracellular esterases split off the ester groups and the regenerated membrane impermeable TDA molecule is trapped inside the cell. After incubation of effector and target cells e.g. for at least two hours up to 3.5 hours at 37 C. under 5 CO the TDA released from the lysed target cells is chelated with Eu3 and the fluorescence of the Europium TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time resolved fluorometer e.g. Victor 1420 Perkin Elmer Wallac .

In another specific embodiment the ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprises the following steps Preferably 4 5 10target cells e.g. SK BR 3 MCF 7 OVCAR3 Raji cells are labeled with bis acetoxymethyl 2 2 6 2 terpyridine t 6 dicarboxylate DELFIA BATDA Reagent Perkin Elmer Wallac . For optimal labeling efficiency the number of target cells used in the ADCC assay should preferably not exceed 5 06. BATDA reagent is added to the cells and the mixture is incubated at 37 C. preferably under 5 CO for at least 30 minutes. The cells are then washed with a physiological buffer e.g. PBS with 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole and media containing 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole. The labeled target cells are then opsonized coated with a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region i.e. an immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region of the invention including but not limited to a polyclonal antibody a monoclonal antibody a bispecific antibody a multi specific antibody a humanized antibody or a chimeric antibody. In preferred embodiments the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region used in the ADCC assay is specific for a cell surface receptor a tumor antigen or a cancer antigen. The immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention is introduced may specifically bind any cancer or tumor antigen such as those listed in Section 6.4. Additionally the immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention is introduced may be any therapeutic antibody specific for a cancer antigen such as those listed in Section 6.4. In some embodiments the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region used in the ADCC assay is an anti fluoresceine monoclonal antibody 4 4 20 Kranz et al 1982 257 12 6987 6995 a mouse human chimeric anti CD20 monoclonal antibody 2H7 Liu et al 1987139 3521 6 or a humanized antibody Ab4D5 against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 p185 HER2 Carter et al. 199289 4285 9 . The target cells in the ADCC assay are chosen according to the immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention has been introduced so that the immunoglobulin binds a cell surface receptor of the target cell specifically. Preferably the ADCC assays of the invention are performed using more than one engineered antibody e.g. anti Her2 neu 4 4 20 2B6 Rituxan and 2H7 harboring the Fc variants of the invention. In a most preferred embodiment the Fc variants of the invention are introduced into at least 3 antibodies and their ADCC activities are tested. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action examining at least 3 antibodies in these functional assays will diminish the chance of eliminating a viable Fc mutation erroneously.

Opsonized target cells are added to effector cells e.g. PBMC to produce effector target ratios of approximately 50 1 75 1 or 100 1. In a specific embodiment when the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region has the variable domain of 4 4 20 the effector target is 75 1. The effector and target cells are incubated for at least two hours up to 3.5 hours at 37 C. under 5 CO. Cell supernatants are harvested and added to an acidic europium solution e.g. DELFIA Europium Solution Perkin Elmer Wallac . The fluorescence of the Europium TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time resolved fluorometer e.g. Victor 1420 Perkin Elmer Wallac . Maximal release MR and spontaneous release SR are determined by incubation of target cells with 1 TX 100 and media alone respectively. Antibody independent cellular cytotoxicity AICC is measured by incubation of target and effector cells in the absence of antibody. Each assay is preferably performed in triplicate. The mean percentage specific lysis is calculated as Experimental release ADCC AICC MR SR 100.

The invention encompasses characterization of the Fc variants in both NK dependent and macrophage dependent ADCC assays. Fc variants of the invention have altered phenotypes such as an altered effector function as assayed in an NK dependent or macrophage dependent assay.

The invention encompasses assays known in the art and exemplified herein to bind C1q and mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . To determine C1q binding a C1q binding ELISA may be performed. An exemplary assay may comprise the following assay plates may be coated overnight at 4C with polypeptide variant or starting polypeptide control in coating buffer. The plates may then be washed and blocked. Following washing an aliquot of human C1q may be added to each well and incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature. Following a further wash 100 uL of a sheep anti complement C1q peroxidase conjugated antibody may be added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plate may again be washed with wash buffer and 100 ul of substrate buffer containing OPD O phenylenediamine dihydrochloride Sigma may be added to each well. The oxidation reaction observed by the appearance of a yellow color may be allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and stopped by the addition of 100 ul of 4.5 NH2 SO4. The absorbance may then read at 492 405 nm.

A preferred variant in accordance with the invention is one that displays a significant reduction in C1q binding as detected and measured in this assay or a similar assay. Preferably the molecule comprising an Fc variant displays about 50 fold reduction about 60 fold about 80 fold or about 90 fold reduction in C1q binding compared to a control antibody having a nonmutated IgG1 Fc region. In the most preferred embodiment the molecule comprising an Fc variant does not bind C1q i.e. the variant displays about 100 fold or more reduction in C1q binding compared to the control antibody.

Another exemplary variant is one which has a better binding affinity for human C1q than the molecule comprising wild type Fc region. Such a molecule may display for example about two fold or more and preferably about five fold or more improvement in human C1q binding compared to the parent molecule comprising wild type Fc region. For example human C1q binding may be about two fold to about 500 fold and preferably from about two fold or from about five fold to about 1000 fold improved compared to the molecule comprising wild type Fc region.

To assess complement activation a complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC assay may be performed e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 1996 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly various concentrations of the molecule comprising a variant Fc region and human complement may be diluted with buffer. Cells which express the antigen to which the molecule comprising a variant Fc region binds may be diluted to a density of about 1 10cells ml. Mixtures of the molecule comprising a variant Fc region diluted human complement and cells expressing the antigen may be added to a flat bottom tissue culture 96 well plate and allowed to incubate for 2 hrs at 37 C and 5 CO2 to facilitate complement mediated cell lysis. 50 L of alamar blue Accumed International may then be added to each well and incubated overnight at 37 C. The absorbance is measured using a 96 well fluorometer with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. The results may be expressed in relative fluorescence units RFU . The sample concentrations may be computed from a standard curve and the percent activity as compared to nonvariant molecule i.e. a molecule comprising wild type Fc region is reported for the variant of interest.

In some embodiments an Fc variant of the invention does not activate complement. Preferably the variant does not appear to have any CDC activity in the above CDC assay. The invention also pertains to a variant with enhanced CDC compared to a parent molecule a molecule comprising wild type Fc region e.g. displaying about two fold to about 100 fold improvement in CDC activity in vitro or in vivo e.g. at the IC50 values for each molecule being compared . Complement assays may be performed with guinea pig rabbit or human serum. Complement lysis of target cells may be detected by monitoring the release of intracellular enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase LDH as described in Korzeniewski et al. 1983 64 3 313 20 and Decker et al. 1988 115 1 61 9 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety or the release of an intracellular table such as europium chromium 51 or indium 111 in which target cells are labeled as described herein.

The molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions may also be assayed using any surface plasmon resonance based assays known in the art for characterizing the kinetic parameters of Fc Fc R interaction binding. Any SPR instrument commercially available including but not limited to BIAcore Instruments available from Biacore AB Uppsala Sweden IAsys instruments available from Affinity Sensors Franklin Mass.

For a review of SPR based technology see Mullet et al. 200022 77 91 Dong et al 200282 303 23 Fivash et al 19989 97 101 Rich et al. 200011 54 61 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Additionally any of the SPR instruments and SPR based methods for measuring protein protein interactions described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 373 577 6 289 286 5 322 798 5 341 215 6 268 125 are contemplated in the methods of the invention all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Briefly SPR based assays involve immobilizing a member of a binding pair on a surface and monitoring its interaction with the other member of the binding pair in solution in real time. SPR is based on measuring the change in refractive index of the solvent near the surface that occurs upon complex formation or dissociation. The surface onto which the immobilization occurs is the sensor chip which is at the heart of the SPR technology it consists of a glass surface coated with a thin layer of gold and forms the basis for a range of specialized surfaces designed to optimize the binding of a molecule to the surface. A variety of sensor chips are commercially available especially from the companies listed supra all of which may be used in the methods of the invention. Examples of sensor chips include those available from BIAcore AB Inc. e.g. Sensor Chip CM5 SA NTA and HPA. A molecule of the invention may be immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip using any of the immobilization methods and chemistries known in the art including but not limited to direct covalent coupling via amine groups direct covalent coupling via sulfhydryl groups biotin attachment to avidin coated surface aldehyde coupling to carbohydrate groups and attachment through the histidine tag with NTA chips.

In some embodiments the kinetic parameters of the binding of molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions e.g. immunoglobulins comprising variant Fc region to an Fc R may be determined using a BIAcore instrument e.g. BIAcore instrument 1000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . Any Fc R can be used to assess the interaction with the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions. In a specific embodiment the Fc R is Fc RIIIA preferably a soluble monomeric Fc RIIIA. For example in one embodiment the soluble monomeric Fc RIIIA is the extracellular region of Fc RIIIA joined to the linker AVITAG sequence see U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 439 498 filed on Jan. 9 2003 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 456 041 filed on Mar. 19 2003 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . In another specific embodiment the Fc R is Fc RIIB preferably a soluble dimeric FC RIIB. For example in one embodiment the soluble dimeric Fc RIIB protein is prepared in accordance with the methodology described in U.S. Provisional application No. 60 439 709 filed on Jan. 13 2003 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

An exemplary assay for determining the kinetic parameters of a molecule comprising a variant Fc region wherein the molecule is the 4 4 20 antibody to an Fc R using a BIAcore instrument comprises the following BSA FITC is immobilized on one of the four flow cells of a sensor chip surface preferably through amine coupling chemistry such that about 5000 response units RU of BSA FITC is immobilized on the surface. Once a suitable surface is prepared 4 4 20 antibodies carrying the Fc mutations are passed over the surface preferably by one minute injections of a 20 g mL solution at a 5 L mL flow rate. The level of 4 4 20 antibodies bound to the surface ranges between 400 and 700 RU. Next dilution series of the receptor Fc RIIA and Fc RIIB Fc fusion protein in HBS P buffer 20 mM HEPES 150 mM NaCl 3 mM EDTA pH 7.5 are injected onto the surface at 100 L min. Antibody regeneration between different receptor dilutions is carried out preferably by single 5 second injections of 100 mM NaHCOpH 9.4 3M NaCl. Any regeneration technique known in the art is contemplated in the method of the invention.

Once an entire data set is collected the resulting binding curves are globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the SPR instrument manufacturer e.g. BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . These algorithms calculate both the Kand K from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant Kis deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants i.e. K K . More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluaion Software Handbook BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . The analysis of the generated data may be done using any method known in the art. For a review of the various methods of interpretation of the kinetic data generated see Myszka 19978 50 7 Fisher et al. 19945 389 95 O Shannessy 19945 65 71 Chaiken et al. 1992201 197 210 Morton et al. 1995227 176 85 O Shannessy et al. 1996236 275 83 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

In preferred embodiments the kinetic parameters determined using an SPR analysis e.g. BIAcore may be used as a predictive measure of how a molecule of the invention will function in a functional assay e.g. ADCC. An exemplary method for predicting the efficacy of a molecule of the invention based on kinetic parameters obtained from an SPR analysis may comprise the following determining the Kvalues for binding of a molecule of the invention to Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB plotting 1 K wt K mut for Fc RIIIA 2 K mut K wt for Fc RIIB against the ADCC data. Numbers higher than one show a decreased dissociation rate for Fc RIIIA and an increased dissociation rate for Fc RIIB relative to wild type and possess and enhanced ADCC function.

The present invention also includes polynucleotides that encode the molecules including the polypeptides and antibodies of the invention identified by the methods of the invention. The polynucleotides encoding the molecules of the invention may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined by any method known in the art.

Once the nucleotide sequence of the molecules e.g. antibodies that are identified by the methods of the invention is determined the nucleotide sequence may be manipulated using methods well known in the art e.g. recombinant DNA techniques site directed mutagenesis PCR etc. see for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 20013rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 John Wiley Sons NY which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties to generate for example antibodies having a different amino acid sequence for example by generating amino acid substitutions deletions and or insertions.

In a specific embodiment when the nucleic acids encode antibodies one or more of the CDRs are inserted within framework regions using routine recombinant DNA techniques. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions and preferably human framework regions see e.g. Chothia et al. 1998278 457 479 for a listing of human framework regions .

In another embodiment human libraries or any other libraries available in the art can be screened by standard techniques known in the art to clone the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention.

Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding molecules of the invention i.e. antibodies has been obtained the vector for the production of the molecules may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the coding sequences for the molecules of the invention and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. See for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 19902d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 John Wiley Sons NY .

An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of a molecule identified by the methods of the invention i.e. an antibody can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques e.g. electroporation liposomal transfection and calcium phosphate precipitation and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the molecules of the invention. In specific embodiments the expression of the molecules of the invention is regulated by a constitutive an inducible or a tissue specific promoter.

The host cells used to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention may be either bacterial cells such as or preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins Foecking et al. 199845 101 Cockett et al. 19908 2 .

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the molecules of the invention may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express the molecules of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. and transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing coding sequences for the molecules identified by the methods of the invention yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing the sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV and tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 293T 3T3 cells lymphatic cells see U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 715 Per C.6 cells human retinal cells developed by Crucell harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaceinia virus 7.5K promoter .

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. 19832 1791 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye 198513 3101 3109 Van Heeke Schuster 198924 5503 5509 and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free gluta thione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non essential regions e.g. the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter e.g. the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts e.g. see Logan Shenk 198481 355 359 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see Bittner et al. 1987153 51 544 .

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK Hela COS MDCK 293 293T 3T3 WT38 BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT20 and T47D CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express an antibody of the invention may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibodies of the invention. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibodies of the invention.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al 197711 223 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski 199248 202 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 198022 817 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 198077 357 O Hare et al 198178 1527 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg 198178 2072 neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 12 488 505 Wu and Wu 1991 3 87 95 Tolstoshev 199332 573 596 Mulligan 1993260 926 932 and Morgan and Anderson 199362 191 217 May 199311 5 155 215 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. eds. 1993 John Wiley Sons NY Kriegler 1990 Stockton Press NY and in Chapters 12 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds 1994 John Wiley Sons NY. Colberre Garapin et al 1981150 1 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin Santerre et al. 1984 Gene 30 147 .

The expression levels of an antibody of the invention can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel Vol. 3 Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing an antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the nucleotide sequence of the antibody production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al 19833 257 .

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot 1986322 52 Kohler 198077 2197 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomie DNA.

Once a molecule of the invention i.e. antibodies has been recombinantly expressed it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of polypeptides or antibodies for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of polypeptides or antibodies.

The present invention encompasses administering one or more of the molecules of the invention e.g. antibodies to an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably a human for preventing treating or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with a disease disorder or infection. The molecules of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment or prevention of a disease or disorder where an enhanced efficacy of effector cell function e.g. ADCC mediated by Fc R is desired. The methods and compositions of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment or prevention of primary or metastatic neoplastic disease i.e. cancer and infectious diseases. Molecules of the invention may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein. As detailed below the molecules of the invention can be used in methods of treating or preventing cancer particularly in passive immunotherapy autoimmune disease inflammatory disorders or infectious diseases.

The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with other therapeutic agents known in the art for the treatment or prevention of a cancer autoimmune disease inflammatory disorders or infectious diseases. In a specific embodiment molecules of the invention may be used in combination with monoclonal or chimeric antibodies lymphokines or hematopoietic growth factors such as e.g. IL 2 IL 3 and IL 7 which for example serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the molecules and increase immune response. The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with one or more drugs used to treat a disease disorder or infection such as for example anti cancer agents anti inflammatory agents or anti viral agents e.g. as detailed in Sections 6.4.1.2 and 6.4.2.1 below.

The invention encompasses methods and composition for treatment or prevention of cancer or metastasis in a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising a variant Fc region.

Molecules of the invention i.e. polypeptides antibodies comprising variant Fc regions can be used to prevent inhibit or reduce the growth of primary tumors or metastasis of cancerous cells. In one embodiment the molecule of the invention comprises a variant Fc that binds Fe RIIIA and or Fc RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region binds Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA and or said variant Fc region has an enhanced effector function e.g. ADCC CDC phagocytosis opsonization etc. Such molecules can be used alone to treat or prevent cancer. In another embodiment the molecule of the invention comprises a variant Fc region that binds Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region binds Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA and further binds Fc RIIB with a lower affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region binds Fc RIIB and or said variant Fc region has an enhanced effector function e.g. ADCC CDC phagocytosis opsonization etc. Such molecules can also be used alone to treat or prevent cancer.

In some embodiments the invention encompasses methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of cancer in a subject with Fc R polymorphisms such as those homozygous for the Fc RIIIA 158V or Fc RIIIA 158F alleles. In some embodiments the invention encompasses engineering therapeutic antibodies e.g. tumor specific monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the methods of the invention such that the engineered antibodies have enhanced efficacy in patients homozygous for the low affinity allele of Fc RIIIA 158F . In other embodiments the invention encompasses engineering therapeutic antibodies e.g. tumor specific monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the methods of the invention such that the engineered antibodies have enhanced efficacy in patients homozygous for the high affinity allele of Fc RIIIA 158V .

In some embodiments the engineered antibodies of the invention are particularly effective in treating and or preventing non Hodgkin s lymphoma NHL . The engineered antibodies of the invention are therapeutically more effective than current therapeutic regimens for NHL including but not limited to chemotherapy and immunotherapy using anti CD20 mAb Rituximab. The efficacy of anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies however depends on the Fc R polymorphism of the subject Carton et al. 2002 99 754 8 Weng et al. 2003 21 21 3940 7 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . These receptors are expressed on the surface of the effector cells and mediate ADCC. High affinity alleles of the low affinity activating receptors improve the effector cells ability to mediate ADCC. The methods of the invention allow engineering anti CD20 antibodies harboring Fc mutations to enhance their affinity to Fc R on effector cells via their altered Fc domains. The engineered antibodies of the invention provide better immunotherapy reagents for patients regardless of their Fc R polymorphism.

An exemplary method for determining the efficacy of the engineered anti CD20 antibodies in a subject may include the following Plasmids harboring chimeric anti HER2 neu heavy chain genes with Fc mutations that show substantially increased killing in ADCC can be used as a backbone to transfer in the variable domain from the Rituximab heavy chain gene. The variable region from the anti HER2 neu Fe variant is replaced with the variable region from Rituximab. Plasmids containing wild type Fc domains or a D265A mutation to abrogate FcR binding or the anti CD20 Fe variants are transiently cotransfected with the Rituximab light chain gene into 293H cells conditioned media and the antibody is purified over a protein G column using routine methods.

Anti CD20 mAbs harboring the Fc variants are tested by ADCC using a cultured B cell line to determine the ability of the Fc mutations to enhance ADCC. Standard ADCC is performed using methods disclosed herein. Lymphocytes are harvested from peripheral blood using a Ficoll Paque gradient Pharmacia . Target Daudi cells a B cell line expressing CD20 are loaded with Europium PerkinElmer and incubated with effectors for 4 hrs at 37 C. Released Europium is detected using a fluorescent plate reader Wallac . The resulting ADCC data indicates the efficacy of the Fc variants to trigger NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and establish which anti CD20 Fc variants can be tested with both patient samples and elutriated monocytes. Fc variants showing the greatest potential for enhancing the efficacy of the anti CD20 antibody are then tested in an ADCC assay using PBMCs from patients. PBMC from healthy donors are used as effector cells. In vitro ADCC assays using anti CD20 variants and Rituximab are performed in primary lymphoma cells from patients with follicular lymphoma. The specific Fc R polymorphism of the donors is determined and cataloged using methods known in the art. ADCC assay is performed by effector cells from patients with different Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIA genotypes.

According to an aspect of the invention molecules e.g. antibodies of the invention comprising variant Fc regions enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy by increasing the potency of the antibody effector function relative to a molecule containing the wild type Fc region e.g. ADCC CDC phagocytosis opsonization etc. In a specific embodiment antibody dependent cellular toxicity and or phagocytosis of tumor cells is enhanced using the molecules of the invention with variant Fc regions. Molecules of the invention may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy cancer treatment by enhancing at least one antibody mediated effector function. In one particular embodiment a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment by enhancing the complement dependent cascade. In another embodiment of the invention the molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment by enhancing the phagocytosis and or opsonization of the targeted tumor cells. In another embodiment of the invention the molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region enhances the efficacy of treatment by enhancing antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC in destruction of the targeted tumor cells.

The invention further contemplates engineering therapeutic antibodies e.g. tumor specific monoclonal antibodies for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic antibody for example by enhancing the effector function of the therapeutic antibody e.g. ADCC . Preferably the therapeutic antibody is a cytotoxic and or opsonizing antibody. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that once molecules of the invention with desired binding properties e.g. molecules with variant Fc regions with at least one amino acid modification which modification enhances the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA relative to a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region have been identified See Section 6.2 and Table 10 according to the methods of the invention therapeutic antibodies may be engineered using standard recombinant DNA techniques and any known mutagenesis techniques as described in Section 6.2.2 to produce engineered therapeutic carrying the identified mutation sites with the desired binding properties. Any of the therapeutic antibodies listed in Table 11 that have demonstrated therapeutic utility in cancer treatment may be engineered according to the methods of the invention for example by modifying the Fc region to have an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA compared to a therapeutic antibody having a wild type Fc region and used for the treatment and or prevention of a cancer characterized by a cancer antigen. Other therapeutic antibodies include those against pathogenic agents such as those against Serotype 6B see e.g. Sun et al. 1999 Infection and Immunity 67 3 1172 9.

The Fc variants of the invention may be incorporated into therapeutic antibodies such as those disclosed herein or other Fc fusion clinical candidates i.e. a molecule comprising an Fc regions which has been approved for us in clinical trials or any other molecule that may benefit from the Fc variants of the instant invention humanized affinity matured modified or engineered versions thereof.

The invention also encompasses engineering any other polypeptide comprising an Fc region which has therapeutic utility including but not limited to ENBREL according to the methods of the invention in order to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of such polypeptides for example by enhancing the effector function of the polypeptide comprising an Fc region.

Accordingly the invention provides methods of preventing or treating cancer characterized by a cancer antigen using a therapeutic antibody that binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic and has been modified at one or more sites in the Fc region according to the invention to bind Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA with a higher affinity than the parent therapeutic antibody and or mediates effector function e.g. ADCC phagocytosis more effectively. In another embodiment the invention provides methods of preventing or treating cancer characterized by a cancer antigen using a therapeutic antibody that binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic and has been engineered according to the invention to bind Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA with a higher affinity and bind Fc RIIB with a lower affinity than the parent therapeutic antibody and or mediates effector function e.g. ADCC phagocytosis more effectively. The therapeutic antibodies that have been engineered according to the invention are useful for prevention or treatment of cancer since they have an enhanced cytotoxic activity e.g. enhanced tumor cell killing and or enhanced for example ADCC activity or CDC activity .

Cancers associated with a cancer antigen may be treated or prevented by administration of a therapeutic antibody that binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic and has been engineered according to the methods of the invention to have for example an enhanced effector function. In one particular embodiment the therapeutic antibodies engineered according to the methods of the invention enhance the antibody mediated cytotoxic effect of the antibody directed at the particular cancer antigen.

In a specific embodiment a molecule of the invention e.g. an antibody comprising a variant Fc region or a therapeutic monoclonal antibody engineered according to the methods of the invention inhibits or reduces the growth of primary tumor or metastasis of cancerous cells by at least 99 at least 95 at least 90 at least 85 at least 80 at least 75 at least 70 at least 60 at least 50 at least 45 at least 40 at least 45 at least 35 at least 30 at least 25 at least 20 or at least 10 relative to the growth of primary tumor or metastasis in the absence of said molecule of the invention.

The invention further encompasses administering the molecules of the invention in combination with other therapies known to those skilled in the art for the treatment or prevention of cancer including but not limited to current standard and experimental chemotherapies hormonal therapies biological therapies immunotherapies radiation therapies or surgery. In some embodiments the molecules of the invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more anti cancer agents therapeutic antibodies e.g. antibodies listed in Table 11 or other agents known to those skilled in the art for the treatment and or prevention of cancer See Section 6.4.1.2 .

In certain embodiments one or more molecule of the invention is administered to a mammal preferably a human concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer. The term concurrently is not limited to the administration of prophylactic or therapeutic agents at exactly the same time but rather it is meant that a molecule of the invention and the other agent are administered to a mammal in a sequence and within a time interval such that the molecule of the invention can act together with the other agent to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For example each prophylactic or therapeutic agent e.g. chemotherapy radiation therapy hormonal therapy or biological therapy may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time however if not administered at the same time they should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Each therapeutic agent can be administered separately in any appropriate form and by any suitable route. In various embodiments the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered less than 1 hour apart at about 1 hour apart at about 1 hour to about 2 hours apart at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart no more than 24 hours apart or no more than 48 hours apart. In preferred embodiments two or more components are administered within the same patient visit.

In other embodiments the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered at about 2 to 4 days apart at about 4 to 6 days apart at about 1 week part at about 1 to 2 weeks apart or more than 2 weeks apart. In preferred embodiments the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a time frame where both agents are still active. One skilled in the art would be able to determine such a time frame by determining the half life of the administered agents.

In certain embodiments the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are cyclically administered to a subject. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first agent for a period of time followed by the administration of a second agent and or third agent for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies and or improves the efficacy of the treatment.

In certain embodiments prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a cycle of less than about 3 weeks about once every two weeks about once every 10 days or about once every week. One cycle can comprise the administration of a therapeutic or prophylactic agent by infusion over about 90 minutes every cycle about 1 hour every cycle about 45 minutes every cycle. Each cycle can comprise at least 1 week of rest at least 2 weeks of rest at least 3 weeks of rest. The number of cycles administered is from about 1 to about 12 cycles more typically from about 2 to about 10 cycles and more typically from about 2 to about 8 cycles.

In yet other embodiments the therapeutic and prophylactic agents of the invention are administered in metronomic dosing regimens either by continuous infusion or frequent administration without extended rest periods. Such metronomic administration can involve dosing at constant intervals without rest periods. Typically the therapeutic agents in particular cytotoxic agents are used at lower doses. Such dosing regimens encompass the chronic daily administration of relatively low doses for extended periods of time. In preferred embodiments the use of lower doses can minimize toxic side effects and eliminate rest periods. In certain embodiments the therapeutic and prophylactic agents are delivered by chronic low dose or continuous infusion ranging from about 24 hours to about 2 days to about 1 week to about 2 weeks to about 3 weeks to about 1 month to about 2 months to about 3 months to about 4 months to about 5 months to about 6 months. The scheduling of such dose regimens can be optimized by the skilled oncologist.

In other embodiments courses of treatment are administered concurrently to a mammal i.e. individual doses of the therapeutics are administered separately yet within a time interval such that molecules of the invention can work together with the other agent or agents. For example one component may be administered one time per week in combination with the other components that may be administered one time every two weeks or one time every three weeks. In other words the dosing regimens for the therapeutics are carried out concurrently even if the therapeutics are not administered simultaneously or within the same patient visit.

When used in combination with other prophylactic and or therapeutic agents the molecules of the invention and the prophylactic and or therapeutic agent can act additively or more preferably synergistically. In one embodiment a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more therapeutic agents in the same pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents in separate pharmaceutical compositions. In still another embodiment a molecule of the invention is administered prior to or subsequent to administration of another prophylactic or therapeutic agent. The invention contemplates administration of a molecule of the invention in combination with other prophylactic or therapeutic agents by the same or different routes of administration e.g. oral and parenteral. In certain embodiments when a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with another prophylactic or therapeutic agent that potentially produces adverse side effects including but not limited to toxicity the prophylactic or therapeutic agent can advantageously be administered at a dose that falls below the threshold that the adverse side effect is elicited.

The dosage amounts and frequencies of administration provided herein are encompassed by the terms therapeutically effective and prophylactically effective. The dosage and frequency further will typically vary according to factors specific for each patient depending on the specific therapeutic or prophylactic agents administered the severity and type of cancer the route of administration as well as age body weight response and the past medical history of the patient. Suitable regimens can be selected by one skilled in the art by considering such factors and by following for example dosages reported in the literature and recommended in the Physician s Desk Reference 56ed. 2002 .

In some embodiments molecules of the invention comprise a variant Fc region having one or more amino acid modifications in one or more regions which modification increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIB but decreases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA. Molecules of the invention with such binding characteristics are useful in regulating the immune response e.g. in inhibiting the immune response in connection with autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. Although not intending to be bound by any mechanism of action molecules of the invention with an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIB and a decreased affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA may lead to dampening of the activating response to Fc R and inhibition of cellular responsiveness.

In some embodiments a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region is not an immunoglobulin and comprises at least one amino acid modification which modification increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIB relative to a molecule comprising a wild type Fc region. In other embodiments said molecule further comprises one or more amino acid modifications which modifications decreases the affinity of the molecule for an activating Fc R. In some embodiments the molecule is a soluble i.e. not membrane bound Fc region. The invention contemplates other amino acid modifications within the soluble Fc region which modulate its affinity for various Fc receptors including those known to one skilled in the art as described herein. In other embodiments the molecule e.g. the Fc region comprising at least one or more amino acid modification is modified using techniques known to one skilled in the art and as described herein to increase the in vivo half life of the Fc region. Such molecules have therapeutic utility in treating and or preventing an autoimmune disorder.

The invention further encompasses using a composition of the invention to induce an immune response against an antigenic or immunogenic agent including but not limited to cancer antigens and infectious disease antigens examples of which are disclosed infra . The vaccine compositions of the invention comprise one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents to which an immune response is desired wherein the one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents is coated with a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity to Fc RIIIA. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action coating an antigenic or immunogenic agent with a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity to Fc RIIIA enhances the immune response to the desired antigenic or immunogenic agent by inducing humoral and cell mediated responses. The vaccine compositions of the invention are particularly effective in eliciting an immune response preferably a protective immune response against the antigenic or immunogenic agent.

In some embodiments the antigenic or immunogenic agent in the vaccine compositions of the invention comprises a virus against which an immune response is desired. The viruses may be recombinant or chimeric and are preferably attenuated. Production of recombinant chimeric and attenuated viruses may be performed using standard methods known to one skilled in the art. The invention encompasses a live recombinant viral vaccine or an inactivated recombinant viral vaccine to be formulated in accordance with the invention. A live vaccine may be preferred because multiplication in the host leads to a prolonged stimulus of similar kind and magnitude to that occurring in natural infections and therefore confers substantial long lasting immunity. Production of such live recombinant virus vaccine formulations may be accomplished using conventional methods involving propagation of the virus in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo followed by purification.

In a specific embodiment the recombinant virus is non pathogenic to the subject to which it is administered. In this regard the use of genetically engineered viruses for vaccine purposes may require the presence of attenuation characteristics in these strains. The introduction of appropriate mutations e.g. deletions into the templates used for transfection may provide the novel viruses with attenuation characteristics. For example specific missense mutations which are associated with temperature sensitivity or cold adaptation can be made into deletion mutations. These mutations should be more stable than the point mutations associated with cold or temperature sensitive mutants and reversion frequencies should be extremely low. Recombinant DNA technologies for engineering recombinant viruses are known in the art and encompassed in the invention. For example techniques for modifying negative strand RNA viruses are known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 166 057 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Alternatively chimeric viruses with suicide characteristics may be constructed for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. Such viruses would go through only one or a few rounds of replication within the host. When used as a vaccine the recombinant virus would go through limited replication cycle s and induce a sufficient level of immune response but it would not go further in the human host and cause disease. Alternatively inactivated killed virus may be formulated in accordance with the invention. Inactivated vaccine formulations may be prepared using conventional techniques to kill the chimeric viruses. Inactivated vaccines are dead in the sense that their infectivity has been destroyed. Ideally the infectivity of the virus is destroyed without affecting its immunogenicity. In order to prepare inactivated vaccines the chimeric virus may be grown in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo purified by zonal ultracentrifugation inactivated by formaldehyde or propiolactone and pooled.

In certain embodiments completely foreign epitopes including antigens derived from other viral or non viral pathogens can be engineered into the virus for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. For example antigens of non related viruses such as HIV gp160 gp120 gp41 parasite antigens e.g. malaria bacterial or fungal antigens or tumor antigens can be engineered into the attenuated strain.

Virtually any heterologous gene sequence may be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations. Preferably heterologous gene sequences are moieties and peptides that act as biological response modifiers. Preferably epitopes that induce a protective immune response to any of a variety of pathogens or antigens that bind neutralizing antibodies may be expressed by or as part of the chimeric viruses. For example heterologous gene sequences that can be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention include but are not limited to influenza and parainfluenza hemagglutinin neuraminidase and fusion glycoproteins such as the HN and F genes of human PIV3. In yet another embodiment heterologous gene sequences that can be engineered into the chimeric viruses include those that encode proteins with immuno modulating activities. Examples of immuno modulating proteins include but are not limited to cytokines interferon type 1 gamma interferon colony stimulating factors interleukin 1 2 4 5 6 12 and antagonists of these agents.

In yet other embodiments the invention encompasses pathogenic cells or viruses preferably attenuated viruses which express the variant antibody on their surface.

In alternative embodiments the vaccine compositions of the invention comprise a fusion polypeptide wherein an antigenic or immunogenic agent is operatively linked to a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA. Engineering fusion polypeptides for use in the vaccine compositions of the invention is performed using routine recombinant DNA technology methods and is within the level of ordinary skill.

The invention further encompasses methods to induce tolerance in a subject by administering a composition of the invention. Preferably a composition suitable for inducing tolerance in a subject comprises an antigenic or immunogenic agent coated with a variant antibody of the invention wherein the variant antibody has a higher affinity to Fc RIIB. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action such compositions are effective in inducing tolerance by activating the Fc RIIB meditated inhibitory pathway.

The invention provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions comprising molecules of the invention i.e. antibodies polypeptides comprising variant Fc regions. The invention also provides methods of treatment prophylaxis and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disease disorder or infection by administering to a subject an effective amount of a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention.

Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a composition comprising molecules of the invention i.e. antibodies polypeptides comprising variant Fc regions e.g. encapsulation in liposomes microparticles microcapsules recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or fusion protein receptor mediated endocytosis See e.g. Wu and Wu 1987262 4429 4432 construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector etc. Methods of administering a molecule of the invention include but are not limited to parenteral administration e.g. intradermal intramuscular intraperitoneal intravenous and subcutaneous epidural and mucosal e.g. intranasal and oral routes . In a specific embodiment the molecules of the invention are administered intramuscularly intravenously or subcutaneously. The compositions may be administered by any convenient route for example by infusion or bolus injection by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings e.g. oral mucosa rectal and intestinal mucosa etc. and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition pulmonary administration can also be employed e.g. by use of an inhaler or nebulizer and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 019 968 5 985 320 5 985 309 5 934 272 5 874 064 5 855 913 5 290 540 and 4 880 078 and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92 19244 WO 97 32572 WO 97 44013 WO 98 31346 and WO 99 66903 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The invention also provides that the molecules of the invention i.e. antibodies polypeptides comprising variant Fc regions are packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of antibody. In one embodiment the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted e.g. with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg more preferably at least 10 mg at least 15 mg at least 25 mg at least 35 mg at least 45 mg at least 50 mg or at least 75 mg. The lyophilized molecules of the invention should be stored at between 2 and 8 C. in their original container and the molecules should be administered within 12 hours preferably within 6 hours within 5 hours within 3 hours or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment molecules of the invention are supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the molecule fusion protein or conjugated molecule. Preferably the liquid form of the molecules of the invention are supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 1 mg ml more preferably at least 2.5 mg ml at least 5 mg ml at least 8 mg ml at least 10 mg ml at least 15 mg kg at least 25 mg ml at least 50 mg ml at least 100 mg ml at least 150 mg ml at least 200 mg ml of the molecules.

The amount of the composition of the invention which will be effective in the treatment prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and the seriousness of the condition and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.

For antibodies encompassed by the invention the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.0001 mg kg to 100 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Preferably the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.0001 mg kg and 20 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 10 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 5 mg kg 0.0001 and 2 mg kg 0.0001 and 1 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 0.75 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 0.5 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg to 0.25 mg kg 0.0001 to 0.15 mg kg 0.0001 to 0.10 mg kg 0.001 to 0.5 mg kg 0.01 to 0.25 mg kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Generally human antibodies have a longer half life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention or fragments thereof may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration of the antibodies by modifications such as for example lipidation.

In one embodiment the dosage of the molecules of the invention administered to a patient are 0.01 mg to 1000 mg day when used as single agent therapy. In another embodiment the molecules of the invention are used in combination with other therapeutic compositions and the dosage administered to a patient are lower than when said molecules are used as a single agent therapy.

In a specific embodiment it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment this may be achieved by for example and not by way of limitation local infusion by injection or by means of an implant said implant being of a porous non porous or gelatinous material including membranes such as sialastic membranes or fibers. Preferably when administering a molecule of the invention care must be taken to use materials to which the molecule does not absorb.

In another embodiment the compositions can be delivered in a vesicle in particular a liposome See Langer 249 1527 1533 1990 Treat et al in Lopez Berestein and Fidler eds. Liss New York pp. 353 365 1989 Lopez Berestein ibid. pp. 3 17 327 see generally ibid. .

In yet another embodiment the compositions can be delivered in a controlled release or sustained release system. Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more molecules of the invention. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 526 938 PCT publication WO 91 05548 PCT publication WO 96 20698 Ning et al 1996 Intratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained Release Gel 39 179 189 Song et al 1995 Antibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long Circulating Emulsions 50 372 397 Cleek et al 1997 Biodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application 24 853 854 and Lam et al. 1997 Microencapsulation of Recombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for Local Delivery 24 759 760 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment a pump may be used in a controlled release system See Langer supra Sefton 198714 20 Buchwald et al. 1980 Surgery 88 507 and Saudek et al 1989321 574 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled release of antibodies see e.g. Langer and Wise eds. CRC Pres. Boca Raton Fla. 1974 Controlled Drug Bioavailability Drug Product Design and Performance Smolen and Ball eds. Wiley New York 1984 Ranger and Peppas 1983 23 61 See also Levy et al 1985228 190 During et al. 1989 Ann. Neurol. 25 351 Howard et al. 19897 1 105 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 679 377 5 916 597 5 912 015 5 989 463 5 128 326 PCT Publication No. WO 99 15154 and PCT Publication No. WO 99 20253 .

In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target e.g. the lungs thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson in Medical Applications of Controlled Release supra vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 . In another embodiment polymeric compositions useful as controlled release implants are used according to Dunn et al. See U.S. Pat. No. 5 945 155 . This particular method is based upon the therapeutic effect of the in situ controlled release of the bioactive material from the polymer system. The implantation can generally occur anywhere within the body of the patient in need of therapeutic treatment. In another embodiment a non polymeric sustained delivery system is used whereby a non polymeric implant in the body of the subject is used as a drug delivery system. Upon implantation in the body the organic solvent of the implant will dissipate disperse or leach from the composition into surrounding tissue fluid and the non polymeric material will gradually coagulate or precipitate to form a solid microporous matrix See U.S. Pat. No. 5 888 533 .

For antibodies the therapeutically or prophylactically effective dosage administered to a subject is typically 0.1 mg kg to 200 mg kg of the subject s body weight. Preferably the dosage administered to a subject is between 0.1 mg kg and 20 mg kg of the subject s body weight and more preferably the dosage administered to a subject is between 1 mg kg to 10 mg kg of the subject s body weight. The dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced also by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration e.g. into the lung of the antibodies or fusion proteins by modifications such as for example lipidation.

The invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutic antibody e.g. tumor specific monoclonal antibody that is specific for a particular cancer antigen comprising one or more amino acid modifications in the Fc region as determined in accordance with the instant invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

In a specific embodiment the term pharmaceutically acceptable means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals and more particularly in humans. The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant e.g. Freund s adjuvant complete and incomplete excipient or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents.

Several aspects of the pharmaceutical compositions prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are preferably tested in vitro in a cell culture system and in an animal model organism such as a rodent animal model system for the desired therapeutic activity prior to use in humans. For example assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific pharmaceutical composition is desired include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture and exposed to or otherwise contacted with a pharmaceutical composition of the invention and the effect of such composition upon the tissue sample is observed. The tissue sample can be obtained by biopsy from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most effective prophylactic or therapeutic molecule s for each individual patient. In various specific embodiments in vitro assays can be carried out with representative cells of cell types involved in an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder e.g. T cells to determine if a pharmaceutical composition of the invention has a desired effect upon such cell types.

Combinations of prophylactic and or therapeutic agents can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to use in humans. Such animal model systems include but are not limited to rats mice chicken cows monkeys pigs dogs rabbits etc. Any animal system well known in the art may be used. In a specific embodiment of the invention combinations of prophylactic and or therapeutic agents are tested in a mouse model system. Such model systems are widely used and well known to the skilled artisan. Prophylactic and or therapeutic agents can be administered repeatedly. Several aspects of the procedure may vary. Said aspects include the temporal regime of administering the prophylactic and or therapeutic agents and whether such agents are administered separately or as an admixture.

Preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are for example transgenic mice expressing human Fc Rs on mouse effector cells e.g. any mouse model described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 396 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety can be used in the present invention. Transgenic mice for use in the methods of the invention include but are not limited to mice carrying human Fc RIIA mice carrying human Fc RIIA mice carrying human Fc RIIB and human Fc RIIIA mice carrying human Fc RIIB and human Fc RIIA.

Preferably mutations showing the highest levels of activity in the functional assays described above will be tested for use in animal model studies prior to use in humans. Antibodies harboring the Fc mutants identified using the methods of the invention and tested in ADCC assays including ch4D5 and ch520C9 two anti Erb B2 antibodies and chCC49 an anti TAG72 antibody are preferred for use in animal models since they have been used previously in xenograft mouse model Hudsiak et al. 19899 1165 72 Lewis et al 199337 255 63 Bergman et al. 2001 7 2050 6 Johnson et al. 19951387 93 . Sufficient quantities of antibodies may be prepared for use in animal models using methods described supra for example using mammalian expression systems and IgG purification methods disclosed and exemplified herein. A typical experiment requires at least about 5.4 mg of mutant antibody. This calculation is based on average quantities of wild type antibody required to protect 8 10 30 g mice following a loading dose of 4 g g and a weekly maintenance dose 2 g g for ten weeks. invention encompasses tumor cell lines as a source for xenograft tumors such as SK BR 3 BT474 and HT29 cells which are derived from patients with breast adenocarcinoma. These cells have both Erb B2 and the prolactin receptors on their surface. The SK BR 3 cells have been used successfully in both ADCC and xenograft tumor models. In other assays OVCAR3 cells derived from a human ovarian adenocarcinoma may be used. These cells express the antigen TAG72 on the cell surface and can be used in conjunction with the chCC49 antibody. The use of different antibodies and multiple tumor models will circumvent loss of any specific mutations due to an antibody specific Fc mutant incompatibility.

Mouse xenograft models may be used for examining efficacy of mouse antibodies generated against a tumor specific target based on the affinity and specificity of the CDR regions of the antibody molecule and the ability of the Fc region of the antibody to elicit an immune response Wu et al. 2001 Trends Cell Biol. 11 S2 9 . Transgenic mice expressing human Fc Rs on mouse effector cells are unique and are tailor made animal models to test the efficacy of human Fc Fc R interactions. Pairs of Fc RIIIA Fc RIIIB and Fc RIIA transgenic mouse lines generated in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch Through a licensing agreement with Rockefeller U. and Sloan Kettering Cancer center can be used such as those listed in the Table 13 below.

Preferably Fc mutants showing both enhanced binding to Fc RIIIA and reduced binding to Fc RIIB increased activity in ADCC and phagocytosis assays are tested in animal model experiments. The animal model experiments examine the increase in efficacy of Fc mutant bearing antibodies in Fc RIIIA transgenic nude mCD 16A knockout mice compared to a control which has been administered native antibody. Preferably groups of 8 10 mice are examined using a standard protocol. An exemplary animal model experiment may comprise the following steps in a breast cancer model 2 10SK BR 3 cells are injected subcutaneously on day 1 with 0.1 mL PBS mixed with Matrigel Becton Dickinson . Initially a wild type chimeric antibody and isotype control are administered to establish a curve for the predetermined therapeutic dose intravenous injection of 4D5 on day 1 with an initial dose of 4 g g followed by weekly injections of 2 g g. Tumor volume is monitored for 6 8 weeks to measure progress of the disease. Tumor volume should increase linearly with time in animals injected with the isotype control. In contrast very little tumor growth should occur in the group injected with 4D5. Results from the standard dose study are used to set an upper limit for experiments testing the Fc mutants. These studies are done using subtherapeutic doses of the Fc mutant containing antibodies. A one tenth dose was used on xenograft models in experiments done in Fc RIIB knockout mice see Clynes et al. 20006 443 6 with a resultant block in tumor cell growth. Since the mutants of the invention preferably show an increase in Fc RIIIA activation and reduction in Fc RIIB binding the mutants are examined at one tenth therapeutic dose. Examination of tumor size at different intervals indicates the efficacy of the antibodies at the lower dose. Statistical analysis of the data using t test provides a way of determining if the data is significant. Fc mutants that show increased efficacy are tested at incrementally lower doses to determine the smallest possible dose as a measure of their efficacy.

The anti inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be determined by using various experimental animal models of inflammatory arthritis known in the art and described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L. Arthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals in Arthritis and Allied Conditions A Textbook of Rheumatology McCarty et al. eds. Chapter 30 Lee and Febiger 1993 . Experimental and spontaneous animal models of inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune rheumatic diseases can also be used to assess the anti inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention. The following are some assays provided as examples and not by limitation.

The principle animal models for arthritis or inflammatory disease known in the art and widely used include adjuvant induced arthritis rat models collagen induced arthritis rat and mouse models and antigen induced arthritis rat rabbit and hamster models all described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L. Arthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals in Arthritis and Allied Conditions A Textbook of Rheumatology McCarty et al. eds. Chapter 30 Lee and Febiger 1993 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The anti inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be assessed using a carrageenan induced arthritis rat model. Carrageenan induced arthritis has also been used in rabbit dog and pig in studies of chronic arthritis or inflammation. Quantitative histomorphometric assessment is used to determine therapeutic efficacy. The methods for using such a carrageenan induced arthritis model is described in Hansra P. et al. Carrageenan Induced Arthritis in the Rat 24 2 141 155 2000 . Also commonly used are zymosan induced inflammation animal models as known and described in the art.

The anti inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can also be assessed by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan induced paw edema in the rat using a modification of the method described in Winter C. A. et al. Carrageenan Induced Edema in Hind Paw of the Rat as an Assay for Anti inflammatory Drugs 111 544 547 1962 . This assay has been used as a primary in vivo screen for the anti inflammatory activity of most NSAIDs and is considered predictive of human efficacy. The anti inflammatory activity of the test prophylactic or therapeutic agents is expressed as the percent inhibition of the increase in hind paw weight of the test group relative to the vehicle dosed control group.

Additionally animal models for inflammatory bowel disease can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention Kim et al. 1992 Scand. 27 529 537 Strober 198530 12 Suppl 3S 10S . Ulcerative cholitis and Crohn s disease are human inflammatory bowel diseases that can be induced in animals. Sulfated polysaccharides including but not limited to amylopectin carrageen amylopectin sulfate and dextran sulfate or chemical irritants including but not limited to trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid TNBS and acetic acid can be administered to animals orally to induce inflammatory bowel diseases.

Animal models for autoimmune disorders can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention. Animal models for autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes thyroid autoimmunity sytemic lupus eruthematosus and glomerulonephritis have been developed Flanders et al. 199929 235 246 Krogh et al. 199981 511 515 Foster 199919 12 24 .

Further any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for autoimmune and or inflammatory diseases.

Toxicity and efficacy of the prophylactic and or therapeutic protocols of the instant invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD ED. Prophylactic and or therapeutic agents that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While prophylactic and or therapeutic agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and thereby reduce side effects.

The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the prophylactic and or therapeutic agents for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent used in the method of the invention the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC i.e. the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography.

The anti cancer activity of the therapies used in accordance with the present invention also can be determined by using various experimental animal models for the study of cancer such as the SCID mouse model or transgenic mice or nude mice with human xenografts animal models such as hamsters rabbits etc. known in the art and described in 1999 eds. Fiebig and Burger 1999 Karger 1991 eds. Boven and Winograd and 1997 ed. Teicher herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Preferred animal models for determining the therapeutic efficacy of the molecules of the invention are mouse xenograft models. Tumor cell lines that can be used as a source for xenograft tumors include but are not limited to SKBR3 and MCF7 cells which can be derived from patients with breast adenocarcinoma. These cells have both erbB2 and prolactin receptors. SKBR3 cells have been used routinely in the art as ADCC and xenograft tumor models. Alternatively OVCAR3 cells derived from a human ovarian adenocarcinoma can be used as a source for xenograft tumors.

The protocols and compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. Therapeutic agents and methods may be screened using cells of a tumor or malignant cell line. Many assays standard in the art can be used to assess such survival and or growth for example cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring H thymidine incorporation by direct cell count by detecting changes in transcriptional activity of known genes such as proto oncogenes e.g. fos myc or cell cycle markers cell viability can be assessed by trypan blue staining differentiation can be assessed visually based on changes in morphology decreased growth and or colony formation in soft agar or tubular network formation in three dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation etc.

Compounds for use in therapy can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to testing in humans including but not limited to in rats mice chicken cows monkeys rabbits hamsters etc. for example the animal models described above. The compounds can then be used in the appropriate clinical trials.

Further any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for treatment or prevention of cancer inflammatory disorder or autoimmune disease.

Having now generally described the invention the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention unless specified.

Fc mutants exhibiting altered affinity to Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB were determined from yeast display technology and Fc R Fc interaction assays as disclosed in U.S Patent Application Publications 2005 0037000 and 2005 0064514 and International Patent Application Publication WO 04 063351 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Effects of the mutant in in vitro assays was assed by determining kinetic parameters of the binding of ch4 4 20 antibodies harboring the Fc mutants using a BIAcore assay BIAcore instrument 1000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . The Fc RIIIA used in this assay was a soluble monomeric protein the extracellular region of Fc RIIIA joined to the linker AVITAG sequence while the Fc RIIB used in this assay was a soluble dimeric protein both were prepared as described in U.S Patent Application Publications 2005 0037000 and 2005 0064514 and International Patent Application Publication WO 04 063351. Briefly the Fc RIIB used was the extracellular domain of Fc RIIB fused to the hinge CH2 CH3 domain of human IgG2.

BSA FITC 36 g mL in 10 mM Acetate Buffer at pH 5.0 was immobilized on one of the four flow cells flow cell 2 of a sensor chip surface through amine coupling chemistry by modification of carboxymethyl groups with mixture of NHS EDC such that about 5000 response units RU of BSA FITC was immobilized on the surface. Following this the unreacted active esters were capped off with an injection of 1M Et NH2. Once a suitable surface was prepared ch 4 4 20 antibodies carrying the Fc mutations were passed over the surface by one minute injections of a 20 g mL solution at a 5 L mL flow rate. The level of ch 4 4 20 antibodies bound to the surface ranged between 400 and 700 RU. Next dilution series of the receptor Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB Fc fusion protein in HBS P buffer 10 mM HEPES 150 mM NaCl 0.005 Surfactant P20 3 mM EDTA pH 7.4 were injected onto the surface at 100 L min. Antibody regeneration between different receptor dilutions was carried out by single 5 second injections of 100 mM NaHCOpH 9.4 3M NaCl.

The same dilutions of the receptor were also injected over a BSA FITC surface without any ch 4 4 20 antibody at the beginning and at the end of the assay as reference injections.

Once an entire data set was collected the resulting binding curves were globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the manufacturer BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . These algorithms calculate both the Kand K from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant Kis deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants i.e. K K . More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluaion Software Handbook BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. .

Binding curves for two different concentrations 200 nM and 800 nM for Fc RIIIA and 200 nM and 400 nM for Fc RIIB fusion protein were aligned and responses adjusted to the same level of captured antibodies and the reference curves were subtracted from the experimental curves. Association and dissociation phases were fitted separately. Dissociation rate constant was obtained for interval 32 34 sec of the dissociation phase association phase fit was obtained by a 1 1 Langmuir model and base fit was selected on the basis Rand chicriteria.

The kinetic parameters Kand K that were determined from the BIAcore analysis correlated with the binding characteristic of the mutants as determined by an ELISA assay and the functional activity of the mutants as determined in an ADCC assay. Specifically as seen in Table 14 mutants that had an enhanced ADCC activity relative to the wild type protein and had an enhanced binding to Fc RIIIA as determined by an ELISA assay had an improved Kfor Fc RIIIA i.e. a lower K . Therefore a lower Kvalue for Fc RIIIA for a mutant Fc protein relative to a wild type protein may be likely to have an enhanced ADCC function. On the other hand as seen in Table 15 mutants that had an enhanced ADCC activity relative to the wild type protein and had a reduced binding for Fc RIIB Fc fusion protein as determined by an ELISA assay had a higher Kfor Fc RIIB Fc fusion protein.

Thus the Kvalues for Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB can be used as predictive measures of how a mutant will behave in a functional assay such as an ADCC assay. In fact ratios of Kvalues for Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB Fc fusion protein of the mutants to the wild type protein were plotted against ADCC data . Specifically in the case of Kvalues for Fc RIIIA the ratio of K wt K mutant was plotted against the ADCC data and in the case of Kvalues for Fc RIIB the ratio of K mut K wt was plotted against the ADCC data. Numbers higher than one 1 show a decreased dissociation rate for Fc RIIIA and an increased dissociation rate for Fc RIIB Fc relative to wild type. Mutants that fall within the indicated box have a lower off rate for Fc RIIIA binding and a higher off rate for Fc RIIB Fc binding and possess an enhanced ADCC function.

The following mutant screens were aimed at identifying additional sets of mutants that show improved binding to Fc RIIIA and reduced binding to Fc RIIB. Secondary screening of selected Fc variants was performed by ELISA followed by testing for ADCC in the 4 4 20 system. Mutants were than selected primarily based on their ability to mediate ADCC via 4 4 20 using Fluorescein coated SK BR3 cells as targets and isolated PBMC from human donors as the effector cell population. Fc mutants that showed a relative increase in ADCC e.g. an enhancement by a factor of 2 were than cloned into anti HER2 neu or anti CD20 chAbs and tested in an ADCC assay using the appropriate tumor cells as targets. The mutants were also analyzed by BIAcore and their relative Kwere determined.

Screen 1 Sequential solid phase depletion and selection using Magnetic beads coated with Fc RIIB followed by selection with magnetic beads coated with Fc RIIIA. The aim of this screen was identification of Fc mutants that either no longer bind Fc RIIB or show reduced binding to Fc RIIB. A 10 fold excess of the na ve library 10cells was incubated with magnetic beads My One Dynal coated with Fc RIIB. Yeast bound to beads were separated from the non bound fraction by placing the tube containing the mixture in a magnetic field. Those yeast cells that were not bound to the beads were removed and placed in fresh media. They were next bound to beads that were coated with Fc RIIIA. Yeast bound to beads were separated from the nonbound fraction by placing the tube containing the mixture in a magnetic field. Nonbound yeast were removed and the bound cells were removed by vigorous vortexing. The recovered cells were regrown in glucose containing media and reinduced in selective media containing galactose. The selection process was repeated. The final culture was than used to harvest DNA. Inserts containing the Fc domain were amplified by PCR and cloned into 4 4 20. Approximately 90 Fc mutants were screened by 4 4 20 ELISA and ADCC assays and the resultant positive mutants are shown in Table 16.

Screens 2 3 Mutants Selected by FACS Equilibrium and Kinetic Screening The first library screen identified a mutation at position 396 changing the amino acid from Proline to Leucine P396L . This Fc variant showed increased binding to both Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB. A second library was constructed using P396L as a base line. PCR mutagenesis was used to generate 107 mutants each of which contained the P396L mutation and contained additional nucleotide changes. The P396L library was screened using two sets of conditions.

An equilibrium screen was performed using biotinylated Fc RIIIA linker avitag as a monomer using methods already described. Approximately 10 fold excess of library 10cells was incubated in a 0.5 mL of approximately 7 nM Fc RIIIA for 1 hr. The mixture was sorted by FACS selecting top 1.2 of binders. Selected yeast cells were grown in selective media containing glucose and reinduced in selective media containing galactose. The equilibrium screen was repeated a second time and the sort gate was set to collect the top 0.2 of binders. The selected yeast cells were then grown under selective conditions in glucose. This culture was than used to harvest DNA. Inserts containing the Fc domain were amplified by PCR and cloned into the nucleotide sequence encoding 4 4 20 variable domain using methods already described. Approximately 90 Fc mutants were screened by 4 4 20 ELISA and ADCC and the resultant positive mutants are shown in Table 17.

A kinetic screen was also implemented to identify mutants with improved Kin binding Fc RIIIA. Conditions were established for screening the P396L library using a strain with the P396L Fc variant displayed on the yeast surface. Briefly cells grown under inducing conditions were incubated with 0.1 M biotinylated Fc RIIIA linker avitag monomer for 1 hr. The cells were washed to remove the labeled ligand. Labeled cells were then incubated for different times with 0.1 M unlabeled Fc RIIIA linker avitag monomer washed and then stained with SA PE for FACS analysis . Cells were also stained with goat anti human Fc to show that the Fc display was maintained during the experiment.

Based on the competition study it was determined that a 1 minute incubation resulted in approximately 50 loss of cell staining. This time point was chosen for the kinetic screen using the P396L library. Approximately 10 fold excess of library 10cells was incubated with 0.1 M biotinylated Fc RIIIA linker avitag monomer in a 0.5 mL volume. Cells were washed and then incubated for 1 minute with unlabeled ligand. Subsequently the cells were washed and labeled with SA PE. The mixture was sorted by FACS selecting the top 0.3 of binders. Selected yeast cells were grown in selective media containing glucose and reinduced in selective media containing galactose. The kinetic screen was repeated a second time and the sort gate was set to collect the top 0.2 of binders. The nonselected P396L library was compared to the yeast cells selected for improved binding by FACS . The histograms show the percentage of cells that are costained with both Fc RIIIA PE and goat anti human Fc FITC upper right .

The selected yeast cells from the second sort were then grown under selective conditions in glucose. This culture was than used to harvest DNA. Inserts containing the Fc domain were amplified by PCR and cloned into the nucleotide sequence encoding 4 4 20 variable domain using methods described above. Approximately 90 Fc mutants were screened by 4 4 20 ELISA and ADCC and the resultant positive mutants are shown in Table 18.

Screens 4 and 5 Combining the Solid Phase Fc RIIB Depletion Step with Fc RIIIA Selection by FACs Sort Using the Fc RIIIA 158V Allele

Analysis of Fc variants from Screen 1 showed that the mutations that were selected from the secondary screen had improved binding to both Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB. Therefore the data suggested that sequential depletion and selection using magnetic beads solid phase under the established conditions did not efficiently select for differential binding of Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB. Therefore in order to screen more effectively for mutants that bind Fc RIIIA while having reduced or no binding to Fc RIIB the solid phase Fc RIIB depletion step was combined with Fc RIIIA selection by FACs sort. This combination identified Fc variants that bind Fc RIIIA with greater or equal affinity than wild type Fc.

A 10 fold excess of the na ve library 10 was incubated with magnetic beads coated with Fc RIIB. Yeast bound to beads were separated from the non bound fraction by placing the tube containing the mixture in a magnetic field. Those yeast cells that were not bound to the beads were removed and placed in fresh media and subsequently reinduced in media containing galactose. The Fc RIIB depletion by magnetic beads was repeated 5 times. The resulting yeast population was analyzed and found to show greater than 50 cell staining with goat anti human Fc and a very small percentage of cells were stained with Fc RIIIA. These cells were then selected twice by a FACS sort using 0.1 M biotinylated Fc RIIIA linker avitag data not shown . The Fc RIIIA was the 158V allotype. Yeast cells were analyzed for both Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB binding after each sort and compared to binding by wild type Fc domain A B .

The selected yeast cells from the second sort were then grown under selective conditions in glucose. This culture was then used to harvest DNA. Inserts containing the Fc domain were amplified by PCR and cloned into the nucleotide sequence encoding 4 4 20 variable domain. Approximately 90 Fc mutants were screened by 4 4 20 ELISA and ADCC and the resultant positive mutants are shown in Table 19 mutants 61 66 .

Screening of Fc mutants using the 158F allele of Fc RIIIA Two different alleles of Fc RIIIA receptor exist that have different binding affinities for the IgG1 Fe domain Koene et al. 199790 1109 1114 Wu et al. 1997100 1059 70 . The 158F allele binds to the Fc domain with a binding constant 5 10 fold lower than the 158V allele. Previously all of the Fc screens using yeast display were done using the high binding 158V allele as a ligand. In this experiment Fc mutants were selected from the Fc RIIB depleted yeast population using biotinylated Fc RIIIA158F linker avitag monomer as a ligand. The sort gate was set to select the top 0.25 percent Fc RIIIA 158F binders. The resulting enriched population was analyzed by FACS . Individual clones were then isolated and their binding to different Fc Rs were analyzed by FACS . Analysis of individual clones from the population resulted in the identification of a single mutant harboring 5 mutations MgFc67 V284M S298N K334E R355W R416S which had an enhanced binding to Fc RIIIA and a reduced binding to Fc RIIB.

Mutants that were selected in the above screens were then analyzed using a standard ADCC assay to determine the relative rates of lysis mediated by ch4 4 20 harboring the Fc mutants. ch4 4 20 antibodies carrying the Fc variants were constructed using methods already described above. SK BR3 cells were used as targets and effector cells were PBMC that were isolated from donors using a Ficoll gradient as described supra Section 7.7 . The ADCC activity results for the mutants are summarized in Table 20.

As seen in Table 23 mutants isolated using the above primary and secondary screens based on Fc RIIB depletion and Fc RIIIA selection showed enhanced ADCC activity relative to wild type.

Mutants 37 38 39 41 43 were analyzed using 0.5 g mL ch4 4 20. All other antibodies were tested at 1 g mL. All rates were normalized to wild type ch4 4 20 IgG1 .

Mutants were additionally cloned into the heavy chain of antitumor monoclonal antibody 4D5 anti HER2 neu and anti CD20 monoclonal antibody 2H7 by replacing the Fc domain of these monoclonal antibodies. These chimeric monoclonal antibodies were expressed and purified and tested in an ADCC assay using standard methods by transient transfection into 293H cells and purification over protein G column. The chimeric 4D5 antibodies were tested in an ADCC assay using SK BR3 cells as targets whereas the chimeric 2H7 antibodies were tested in an ADCC assay using Daudi cells as targets .

Secondary Screen of Mutants via BIAcore Mutants that were selected in the above screens were then analyzed by BIAcore to determine the kinetic parameters for binding Fc RIIIA 158V and Fc RIIB. The method used was similar to that disclosed in Section 7.1 supra.

The data displayed are Kvalues relative to wild type off rates as determined from experiments using the Fc mutants in the ch4 4 20 monoclonal antibody. Relative numbers greater than one indicate a decrease in Krate. Numbers less than one indicate an increase in off rate.

Mutants that showed a decrease in off rates for Fc RIIIA were MgFc38 K392 P396L MgFc43 Y319F P352L P396L MgFc42 D221E D270E V308A Q311H P396L G402D MgFc43b K288R T307A K344E P396L MgFc44 K334N P396L MgFc46 P217S P396L MgFc49 K261N K210M P396L . Mutants that showed a decrease in off rate for Fc RIIB were MgFc38 K392 P396L MgFc39 E293V Q295E A327T MgFc43 K288R T307A K344E P396L MgFc44 K334N P396L . The Biacore data is summarized in Table 21.

Fc variants that show improved binding to Fc RIIIA were tested by PBMC based ADCC using 60 1 effector target ratio. Two different tumor model systems were used as targets SK BR3 anti HER2 neu and Daudi anti CD20 . Percent specific Lysis was quantitated for each mutant. Linear regression analysis was used to plot the data setting the maximal percent lysis at 100 .

ADCC is activated on immune system effector cells via a signal transduction pathway that is triggered by an interaction between low affinity Fc R and an immune complex. Effector cell populations were derived from either primary blood or activated monocyte derived macrophages MDM . Target cells were loaded with europium and incubated with chimeric MAb and subsequently incubated with effector cell populations. Europium works the same way as Cr but it is non radioactive and the released europium is detected in a fluorescent plate reader. Lymphocytes harvested from peripheral blood of donors PBM using a Ficoll Paque gradient Pharmacia contain primarily natural killer cells NK . The majority of the ADCC activity will occur via the NK containing Fc RIIIA but not Fc RIIB on their surface.

Experiments were performed using two different target cell populations SK BR 3 and Daudi expressing HER2 neu and CD20 respectively. ADCC assays were set up using Ch4 4 20 FITC coated SK BR 3 Ch4D5 SKBR3 and Rituxan Daudi data not shown . Chimeric MAbs were modified using Fc mutations identified. Fe mutants were cloned into Ch4D5. Purified Ab was used to opsonize SK BR 3 cells or Daudi cells. Fc mutants were cloned into Ch4D5.

RESULTS. Fc mutants showed improved PBMC mediated ADCC activity in SK BR3 cells . The plot shows linear regression analysis of a standard ADCC assay. Antibody was titrated over 3 logs using an effector to target ratio of 75 1. lysis Experimental release SR MR SR 100.

Fc R dependent tumor cell killing is mediated by macrophage and NK cells in mouse tumor models Clynes et al. 1998 PNAS USA 95 652 6 . Elutriated monocytes from donors were used as effector cells to analyze the efficiency Fc mutants to trigger cell cytotoxicity of target cells in ADCC assays. Expression patterns of Fc RI Fc R3A and Fc R2B are affected by different growth conditions. Fc R expression from frozen monocytes cultured in media containing different combinations of cytokines and human serum were examined by FACS using FcR specific MAbs. Panels A O . Cultured cells were stained with Fc R specific antibodies and analyzed by FACS to determine MDM Fc R profiles. Conditions that best mimic macrophage in vivo Fc R expression i.e. showed the greatest fraction of cells expressing CD16 and CD32B were used in a monocyte derived macrophage MDM based ADCC assay. For the experiment in Panels A O frozen elutriated monocytes were grown for 8 days in DMEM and 20 FBS containing either M CSF condition 1 or GM CSF condition 2 . For the experiment in frozen elutriated monocytes were cultured for 2 days in DMEM and 20 FBS containing GM CSF IL 2 and IFN prior to ADCC assay. Serum free conditions have also been developed which allow for high levels of CD16 and CD32B expression data not shown . Briefly purified monocytes were grown for 6 8 days in Macrophage SFM Invitrogen containing GM CSF M CSF IL 6 IL 10 and IL 10. While the incidence of CD32B CD16 cells in these cultures is highest using a mixture of cytokines combinations of two of more cytokines will also enhance Fc R expression M CSF IL 6 M CSF IL 10 or M CSF IL 1 . For ADCC assays IFN is added for the final 24 48 hours.

MDM based ADCC required incubation times of 16 hrs to observe target cell killing. Target cells were loaded with Indium 111 which is retained for long incubations within the target cells. Indium release was quantitated using a gamma counter. All other reagents Abs and target cells were similar to the PBMC based ADCC assay. ADCC activity due to Fc RI can be efficiently blocked using the anti Fc RI blocking antibody M21 Ancell . The assay conditions differ slightly from the PBMC based assay. 20 1 target to effector 18 14 hr incubation at 37 C.

Fc mutants that show improved PBMC ADCC increased binding to Fc RIIIA or decreased binding to Fc RIIB were tested .

Fc mutants were originally identified based on their increased binding to Fc RIIIA. These mutants were subsequently validated for their improved affinity for all low affinity receptors and in many cases improved activity in ADCC mediated by PBMC. In vivo antibody mediated cytotoxicity can occur through multiple mechanisms. In addition to ADCC other possible mechanisms include complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC and apoptosis. The binding of C1q to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin initiates as cascade resulting in cell lysis by CDC. The interaction between C1q and the Fc has been studied in a series of Fc mutants. The results of these experiments indicate that C1q and the low affinity FcR bind to overlapping regions of the Fc however the exact contact residues within the Fc vary.

Mutants that showed improved ADCC in the PBMC based assay were examined for their effect in CDC. Antibodies were analyzed in the anti CD20 Ch mAb 2H7. We detected improved CDC for each mutant ch mAb tested. Interestingly even though these mutants were selected for their improved ADCC they also show enhanced CDC

Materials and Methods. CDC assay was used to test the Fc mutants using anti CD20 and Daudi cells as targets. Guinea Pig Serum was used as the source for complement US Biological . The CDC assay was similar to PBMC based ADCC. Target cells were loaded with europium and opsonized with ChMAb. However complement guinea pig serum was added instead of effector cells. shows a flow chart of the assay. Anti CD20 ChMab over 3 orders of magnitude was titrated. lysis was calculated. Daudi cells 3 10 were labeled with BADTA reagent. 1 10cells were aliquoted into wells in a 96 well plate. Antibodies were titrated into the wells using 3 fold dilutions. The opsonization reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 40 minutes at 37 C. in 5 CO. Guinea pig serum was added to a final conc. of 20 . The reaction was allowed to proceed for 3.5 hrs at 37 C. in 5 CO. Subsequently 100 uls of cell media was added to the reaction and cells were spun down. For detection 20 uls of the supernatant was added to 200 uls of the Europium solution and the plates were read in the Victor2 Wallac .

RESULTS All mutants that show improved binding for either activating FcR or C1q were placed in the CDC assay . Fc mutants that showed enhanced binding to Fc RIIIA also showed improved complement activity Each of the mutants show enhanced complement activity compared to wild type. The mutants tested are double mutants. In each case one of the mutations present is P396L.

To determine whether the increase in CDC correlated with increased binding of C1q to IgG1 Fc binding between the two proteins was measured in real time using surface plasmon resonance. In order to examine the binding between C1q and an IgG1 Fc the Fc variants were cloned into an anti CD32B ch mAb 2B6. This allowed us to capture the wt and mutant antibodies to the glass slide via soluble CD32B protein . Three of the four mutants tested in CDC were also examined in the Biacore. All 3 showed greatly enhanced Kcompare to wild type Fc . BIAcore format for C1q binding to 2B6 mutants demonstrate enhanced binding of mutants with P396L mutation . Mutation D270E can reduce C1q binding at different extent. A summary of the kinetic analysis of Fc R and C1q binding is depicted in the Table 22 below.

Based on a selection for Fc mutants that reduce binding to Fc RIIB and increase binding to Fc RIIA 131H a number of mutations including D270E were identified. Each mutation was tested individually for binding to the low affinity Fc receptors and their allelic variants.

D270E had the binding characteristics that suggested it would specifically reduce Fc RIIB binding. D270E was tested in combination with mutations that were previously identified based on their improved binding to all FcR.

Results. As shown in Tables 23 and 24 and addition of D270E mutation enhances Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIA H131 binding and reduces binding to Fc RIIB. shows the plot of MDM ADCC data against the Koff as determined for CD32A H131H binding for select mutants.

Kinetic parameters of binding of chimeric 4D5 antibodies harboring Fe mutants to the two allotypes of Fc RIIIA Fc RIIA 131H and Fc RIIB were analyzed by BIAcore using a method similar to that disclosed in Section 7.8 supra. The two allotypes of Fc RIIIA Fc RIIIA 158V and Fc RIIIA 158F are described in further detail in Section 7.9 supra.

Both allotypes of Fc RIIIA used in this assay were soluble monomeric proteins the extracellular region of Fc RIIIA joined to the linker AVITAG sequence as described in Section 7.1. The Fc RIIB and Fc RIIA used in this assay were soluble dimeric proteins i.e. the extracellular domain of Fc RIIB or Fc RIIA fused to the hinge CH2 CH3 domain of human IgG2 as described in Section 7.1 supra.

Details of BIAcore methodology and analysis are found in Section 7.1. In this assay variant Fc regions were cloned into a chimeric 4D5 antibody which is specific for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 neu . The antigen HER2 neu was immobilized on one of the flow cells of the sensor chip. The chimeric 4D5 antibodies carrying the Fc mutations were then passed over the surface by 3 minute injections of a 300 nM solution at 5 l min flow rate. Next dilution series of the receptor in HBS P buffer 10 mM HEPES 150 mM NaCL 0.005 Surfactant P20 3 mMEDTA pH7.4 were injected onto the surface at 100 l min.

Binding curves for two different concentrations of receptor 400 nM and 800 nM for both Fc RIIIA V158 and Fc RIIIA 158F 100 nM and 200 nM for both Fc RIIA and Fc RIIB were aligned and responses adjusted to the same levels of captured antibodies and reference curves subtracted from experimental curves. Association and dissociation phases were separately fitted.

Binding of Fc RIIIA allotype 158 V and 158F Fc RIIB and Fc RIIA 131H were analyzed and resonance responses were normalized at the level of response obtained for a wild type chimeric 4D5 antibody. Kinetic parameters for the binding of the Fc Rs to the chimeric 4D5 antibody were obtained by fitting the data at two different Fc R concentrations 400 nM and 800 nM for both Fc RIIIA V158 and Fc RIIIA 158F 100 nM and 200 nM for both Fc RIIA and Fc RIIB.

Table 25 presents the off rate for each of the four receptors analyzed in association with the indicated variant Fc regions.

Table 26 presents the results of an duplicate study wherein the Kvalues of the chimeric 4D5 antibodies were computed relative to wild type off rates. Relative numbers greater than one indicate a decrease in Krate. Numbers less than one indicate an increase in Krate.

Fc mutations identified in Example 7.7 as comprising increased affinity for Fc IIIA and or Fc IIA were analyzed for their relative ADCC activity.

Details regarding ADCC assays are found in Section 7.1 and in U.S Patent Application Publications 2005 0037000 and 2005 0064514 and International Patent Application Publication WO 04 063351 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In this assay HT29 colon carcinoma cells ATCC Accession No. HTB 38 loaded with Indium 111 were used as targets and effector cells were PBMC that were isolated from donors using a Ficoll gradient. Target cells were opsonized with chimeric 4D5 antibodies comprising the variant Fc regions at final concentrations of 2 5000 ng ml. Opsonized target cells were then added to effector cells to produce an effector target ratio of 50 1 and incubated for 18 hours at 37 C. 5 CO. After incubation cells were centrifuged at 220 g for five minutes at 10 C. The level of Indium 111 in the supernatant was recorded by a gamma counter.

Chimeric 4D5 antibodies comprising variant Fc regions MGFc88 F243L R292P Y300L V305I P396L MGFc88A F243L R292P Y300L P396L and MGFc155 F243L R292P Y300L were selected based on enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc IIA and tested for their ADCC activity. A B show that the Fc variants tested exhibit enhanced ADCC activity relative to wild type antibody at opsonization concentrations above 20 ng ml in a concentration dependent manner. The data indicate that Fc mutants identified as comprising increased affinity for Fc RIIIA are also likely to exhibit enhanced ADCC activity.

Fc mutations identified as comprising enhanced affinity for Fc IIIA and or Fc IIA were further analyzed for relative efficacy of tumor control using an in vivo tumor model system.

Antibodies harboring Fc mutants were tested for anti tumor activity in a murine xenograft system. Balbc nude mice are subcutaneously injected with 5 10Daudi cells and subsequently monitored for general signs of illness e.g. weight gain loss and grooming activity. Without treatment this model system results in 100 mortality with an average survival time of approximately 2 weeks post tumor cell inoculation. Treatment consists of doses of wild type antibody or antibody comprising a variant Fc region administered at weekly intervals. Animals administered buffer alone at the same intervals serve as a control. Tumor weight is calculated based on the estimated volume of the subcutaneous tumor according to the formula width length 2.

At weekly intervals mice inoculated with Daudi cells received wild type humanized 2B6 h2B6 humanized 2B6 comprising mutant FcMG0088 F243L R292P Y300L V305I P396L h2B6 0088 or buffer alone. Wild type and Fc mutant h2B6 antibody showed similar levels of tumor suppression at the highest dose schedule tested weekly doses of 25 g A and B . However significant differences in antibody efficacy were observed when dosages were reduced. 100 and 10 fold reduction in wild type h2B6 dosages provided no greater tumor control than administration of buffer alone A . In contrast h2B6 0088 provided significant protection at weekly doses of 2.5 g and at least limited protection at weekly doses of 0.25 g B .

The protection conferred by even the lowest dose of Fc mutant antibody was confirmed in survival comparisons. At 11 weeks 4 out of 7 mice remained alive in the group treated with 0.25 g doses of h2B6 0088 compared to only 1 out of 7 in the group treated with the same dose of wild type h2B6 A B 

7.10 Fc Mutant Mediated Tumor Growth Control in a Human Fc Receptor Expressing Transgenic Mouse Tumor Model

Fc mutations identified as comprising enhanced affinity for Fc IIIA and or Fc IIA were further analyzed for relative efficacy of tumor control using an in vivo xenograft human Fc receptor transgenic mouse tumor model system.

Humanized antibodies against human CD32B h2B6 or HER2 neu h4D5 harboring Fc mutations were tested for anti tumor activity in a murine xenograft system in which mouse Fc IIIA CD16 was replaced with its human orthologue CD16A huCD16A . Immunodeficient mice were injected with 5 10tumor cells and subsequently monitored for general signs of illness e.g. weight gain loss and grooming activity. Treatment consists of doses of wild type antibody or antibody comprising a variant Fc region administered at daily or weekly intervals as stated . Animals administered buffer alone or antibody comprising mutation N297Q which abrogates binding to any Fc R at the same intervals serve as a control. Tumor weight was calculated based on the estimated volume of the subcutaneous tumor according to the formula width length 2.

At weekly intervals beginning two weeks subsequent to tumor injection RAG1 C57BI 6 mice subcutaneously injected with Raji cells CD32B expressing tumor cells received wild type humanized 2B6 h2B6 Rituxan humanized 2B6 comprising mutant FcMG0088 F243L R292P Y300L V305I P396L h2B6 0088 FcMg88 or MGA321 or buffer alone. Wild type and Fc mutant h2B6 antibody showed similar levels of tumor growth suppression at weekly doses of 250 g and 25 g . However significant differences in antibody efficacy were observed when the dosage was reduced to 2.5 g At this dosage wild type h2B6 provided limited tumor growth control compared with administration of buffer alone in contrast the 2.5 g dosage of h2B6 0088 delayed tumor progression by as much as one week . In another experiment the efficacy of the lower dosages of Fc optimized MGA321 tested were equivalent to controls PBS or Rituxin at equivalent dosages however administration of the highest dosage 250 g of Fc optimized h2B6 antibody provided significant tumor growth control compared with wild type h2B6 and buffer alone treated mice .

The protection conferred by the Fc mutant antibody was confirmed in survival comparisons. Nude FoxN1 mice were intraperitoneally injected with EL4 CD32B cells and then treated on days 0 1 2 3 and 6 with IP administered humanized 2B6 1.3 or humanized 2B6 1.3 comprising mutant 31 60 P247L D270E N421K h2B6 1.3 3160 . At 14 weeks at least 90 of mice treated with h2B6 1.3 3160 survived compared with 55 or less in the group treated with the same dose of wild type h2B6 1.3 and .

In a further survival experiments in the same system mice were treated with IP administered humanized 2B6 3.5 humanized 2B6 3.5 comprising mutant FcMG0088 F243L R292P Y300L V3051 P396L h2B6 3.5 0088 humanized 2B6 3.5 N297Q negative control or buffer alone. At 14 weeks all mice treated with h2B6 3.5 0088 survived compared with 30 in the group treated with the same dose of wild type h2B6 3.5 and 

The protective effects of antibodies comprising variant Fc regions was further tested in transgenic mice carrying human CD32A in addition to the mCD16 huCD16A genotype using the EL4 CD32B model described supra. Treatment with wild type h2B6 or negative control h2B6 3.5 N297Q resulted in only 20 at 100 days post tumor inoculation treatment with Fc optimized antibody h2B6 3.5 0088 increased survival by 10 with 30 survival at 100 days post inoculation .

The effect of the expression of hCD16A and or hCD32A in the transgenic murine EL4 CD32B tumor model on treatment with h2B6 antibodies was further investigated using nude FoxN1 mice positive for hCD16A positive for both hCD16A and hCD32A or positive for hCD32A each on a mCD16 background. Transgenic were intraperitoneally injected with EL4 CD32B cells and then treated at day 0 1 2 and 3 with wild type humanized 2B6 3.5 h2B6 3.5 humanized 2B6 3.5 comprising mutant FcMG0088 F243L R292P Y300L V3051 P396L h2B6 3.5 88 h2B6 N297Q h2B6 3.5 N297Q negative control or buffer alone. At 100 days post tumor inoculation all CD16A positive mice treated with h2B6 3.5 88 survived compared with 50 or less survival in the groups treated with the same dose of wild type h2B6 3.5 or controls . In mice harboring human CD32A in addition to the mCD16 huCD16A genotype survival was not more than 25 at 100 days post inoculation regardless of treatment . In mice expressing hCD32A but not hCD16 only mice in the Fc optimized treatment group treated with h2B6 3.5 88 survived longer than 1 month with 25 survival at 100 days post inoculation .

The effect of different time courses of treatment with Fc optimized antibodies h2B6 0088 MGA321 on mouse survival was also investigated. Intraperitoneal injection of mice with MGA321 immediately after tumor injection conferred survival on 75 100 of mice either at a single or multiple doses over consecutive days or weeks . When MGA321 was first administered a day or later subsequent to tumor introduction it conferred a maximum of 40 survival even when administered in multiple doses over days or weeks .

A HER2 neu positive tumor model was established by IP injection of mSKOV3 cells HER2 neu expressing ovarian tumor cells into mCD16 knockout nude FoxN1 mice that also carried and expressed human CD16A or both human CD16A and human CD32A. At 8 weekly intervals starting at time 0 inoculated mice were subcutaneously injected with wild type chimeric antibody against human HER2 neu ch4D5 ch4D5 comprising FcMG0088 F243L R292P Y300L V305I P396L ch4D5 0088 ch4D5 comprising N297Q aglycosylated negative control ch4D5 N297Q or buffer alone. Treatment with ch4D5 0088 suppressed tumor growth for the entire course of the experiment 10 weeks in transgenic mice positive for human CD16A on the mCD16 background or in transgenic mice harboring human CD32A in addition to the mCD16 huCD16A genotype or B respectively .

The protection conferred by the Fc mutant ch4D5 antibody was confirmed in survival comparisons. Knockout mCD16 mCD16 nude N N mice transgenic for human CD16A were intraperitoneally injected with mSKOV3 cells and then treated with wild type chimeric 4D5 ch4D5 ch4D5 comprising FcMG0088 F243L R292P Y300L V305I P396L ch4D5 N297Q negative control or buffer alone. Tumor inoculated mice received six doses beginning at day 0 day of tumor inoculation of 100 g or 1 g of the antibody delivered IP respectively . At 14 weeks 60 of mice treated with 100 g ch4D5 0088 survived compared with 40 in the group treated with the same dose of wild type ch4D5 and 

A chimeric 4D5 comprising mutant MGFc0155 F243L R292P Y300L ch4D5 0155 or mutant MCFc3160 P247L D270E N421K ch4D5 3160 were tested alongside wild type ch4D5 ch4D5 N297Q and ch4D5 0088 as described supra. Mice received eight weekly intraperitoneal treatments starting at day 0 tumor inoculation with 100 g antibody. In mice receiving doses of 100 g 100 of the group treated with ch4D5 0155 were alive at 130 days post inoculation compared with 85 of those treated with ch4D5 0088 and 50 of those treated with ch4D5 3160. In contrast only approximately 30 of mice given wild type ch4D5 were still alive at day 130. All mice treated with buffer alone or ch4D5 N297Q died within 14 weeks and 10 weeks respectively after tumor injection . At a 10 fold lower dosage Fc optimized antibodies were less efficacious in enhancing survival compared with wild type ch4D5. While ch4D5 0155 was most effective at enhancing survival at earlier time points at 18 weeks 60 of mice in the group treated with ch4D5 0155 or ch4D5 0088 survived compared with 50 of wild type treated and 25 of ch 4D5 3160 treated .

In another set of survival experiments Knockout mCD16 mCD16 nude N N mice transgenic for human CD16A or transgenic for both human CD16A hCD16 and human CD32A hCD32A were intraperitoneally injected with mSKOV3 cells and then starting at day 0 given eight weekly treatments with wild type ch4D5 ch4D5 0088 ch4D5 N297Q or buffer alone. At seven weeks post tumor injection all ch4D5 0088 treated and hCD16 positive mice were alive whereas only 30 of Ch4D5 N297Q and 10 of buffer treated hCD16 positive mice survived . In nude mice harboring human CD32A in addition to the mCD16 huCD16A genotype 50 or the mice treated with ch4D5 0088 were alive after eight weeks compared with those that received ch4D5 N297Q 15 alive at eight weeks or buffer alone all dead before six weeks .

Immunoglobulins whose Fc regions had been mutated in the manner described above are screened for Fc variants having altered Ratios of Affinities to Fc RIII and Fc RII by assessing the Kof the variants and their wild type immunoglobulin progenitors. Testing is done using both the V158 and F158 isotypes of Fc RIII and against Fc RIIB and Fc RIIAH131. The results are summarized in Table 27.

The results show that the methods of the present invention are capable of producing both molecules that possess Fc regions having a Ratio of Affinities greater than wild type i.e. 1 as well as molecules that possess Fc regions having a Ratio of Affinities less than wild type i.e. 1 . An analysis of the Fc variants shows that the variant Fc containing molecules fall into various classes as shown in Table 28.

Fc domains of Fc variants that exhibited improved Ratios of Affinities in the context of the spectrum of murine Fc Rs are evaluated to determine their in vivo efficacy. For such purpose the Fc domains were incorporated into a prototype therapeutic antibody and tested in xenograft mouse models of B cell lymphoma and in tumor models in Fc RIII knock out mice that express the low binding allele of human CD16A. The impact of Fc engineering on tumor clearance was investigated by using WT or human Fc R transgenic mice. Hu2B6 was used as the model mAb since this antibody does not induce complement lysis or apoptosis but inhibits tumor growth in mice by mechanisms that are exquisitely Fc dependent Rankin C. T. et al. 2006 108 2384 2391 . Because hu2B6 does not cross react with murine m Fc RII or other endogenous murine proteins there is no antibody target other than the implanted CD32B positive tumor cells in this model Rankin C. T. et al. 2006 108 2384 2391 . Furthermore hu2B6 completely blocks human CD32B thus eliminating binding of the hu2B6 Fc region to the target cells as a confounding factor. Fc variants 088 3160 5660 3860 and 0071 were selected for this purpose.

Fc variants 088 and 3160 are tested for treatment of B cell tumors in 16A tg mice. Fc variants 088 3160 5660 3860 and 0071 were tested for treatment of B cell tumors in Balb c mice.

Xenograft models Female athymic Balb c nude nu nu mice 8 10 weeks old are purchased from Taconic. Daudi cells 5 10per mouse are suspended in PBS Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into the right flank of Balb c nude mice. Tumor development is monitored twice per week using calipers and tumor weight is estimated by the following formula tumor weight length width 2. Intraperitoneal IP injections of antibodies at various concentrations 1 g g or 0.1 g g are performed weekly for 6 weeks starting at day 0.

EL4 CD32B Model Mate and female athymic mFc RIII hCD16Anude mice are bred in MacroGenics Inc. animal facility. EL4 CD32B cells 1 10per mouse are suspended in PBS and injected IP at day 0. IP injections of antibodies 10 g g or 4 g g are performed on Days 0 1 2 and 3. Mouse body weight is measured twice a week. Mice showing excessive body weight gain as well as signs of ascites tumors are sacrificed by COasphyxiation. Survival was recorded accordingly. Data is analyzed using PRISM Graphpad Software San Diego Calif. for calculation of standard deviation ADCC tumor model and statistical significance using T tests and log rank analysis tumor models .

For a complete mechanistic interpretation of the data the binding profiles of the engineered Fc to the mouse m Fc Rs were fully characterized. Of the mFc R mFc RII is structurally and functionally homologous to human CD32B while mFc RIII and mFc RIV are receptors functionally related to human activating Fc Rs expressed on NK cells and monocyte macrophages respectively Nimmerjahn F. et al. 2005 310 1510 1512 Nimmerjahn F. 2005 23 41 51 . Since the ratio of Fc binding to activating and inhibitory Fc Rs is shown to be important in determining antibody dependent outcomes in vivo Nimmerjahn F. et al. 2005 310 1510 1512 Nimmerjahn F. 2005 23 41 51 mutants are selected based on their binding profiles Table 29 using human FcRs. Data in Table 29 is expressed as fold changes relative to wild type affinities.

Mutants MGFc3160 P247E D270E N421K and MGFc0088 showed increased binding to mFc RIII and mFc RIV respectively. MGFc3160 however showed concomitantly increased mFc RII binding while MFc0088 exhibited a more favorable activating to inhibitory profile with no increase in binding to the inhibitory receptor. Mutant MGFc0071 D270E G316D R416G demonstrated WT Fc level binding to all mFc Rs Table 29 and was included as a control.

Sub cutaneous inoculation of Daudi cells in nude mice produces localized progressively expanding tumors whose growth is significantly reduced by weekly intra peritoneally i.p. injections of 1 g g WT hu2B6 . Weekly 0.1 pg g doses however are ineffective. At the higher dose treatment with hu2B6 MGFc3160 is indistinguishable from that with WT hu2B6 but a modest improvement over WT hu2B6 is detectable at the lower dose. hu2B6 MGFc0088 however resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth at all doses tested consistent with its enhanced mFc RIV binding and highly favorable activating to inhibitory ratio due to no corresponding increase in mFc RII binding. Hu2B6 MGFc0071 which showed WT level binding to all mFc Rs behaved similarly to WT hu2B6 .

The activity of Fc engineered mAbs is further analyzed in mFc RIII knockout mice expressing the transgene for the low affinity allele of human CD16A Li M. et al. 1996 183 1259 1263 . In these mice human CD16A 158is expressed by NK cells and mononuclear phagocytes similarly to its cell type specific expression in humans Perussia B. et al. 21 425 429 . The murine cell line EL4 Gorer P. A. 1950 4 4 372 379 was transduced with human CD32B and used in place of Daudi cells whose tumor take was poor in these transgenic mice. Knock out transgenic mice mFc RIII CD16A 158 injected i.p. with CD32B EL4 cells died eight weeks after inoculation. Treatment with hu2B6 WT rescued 40 of the animals whereas 90 survived after receiving hu2B6 MGFc3160 . In a separate experiment a regimen of hu2B6 MGFc0088 that did not prevent tumor growth as a WT Fc showed 100 mouse survival for the duration of the experiment . Therefore the potency of hu2B6 MGFc3160 and hu2B6 MGFc0088 in vivo ranks consistently with their relative improvement in binding to Fc Rs expressed in the mice Table 29 .

Thus the Ratio of Affinities of an Fc variant is found to be predictive of the in vivo efficacy of molecules comprising the Fc variant region. Both hu2B6 MGFc3160 and hu2B6 MGFc0088 showed enhanced inhibition of tumor cell growth compared to WT mAb. Since MGFc3160 showed an isolated enhancement in mFc RIII binding in the absence of improved mFc RIV interaction the increased activity could be attributable to both NK cells and mononuclear phagocytes. On the contrary the properties of MGFc0088 an Fc domain with substantially increased affinity to mFc RIV but mFc RIII binding properties similar to those of WT were consistent with the notion that mononuclear phagocytes are the critical cells for improved tumor elimination. In the huFc R transgenic mouse the substitution of mFc RIII with huCD16A 158on both NK cells and monocytes resulted in an increase in the activating to inhibitory binding ratio for MGFc0088. Again the greater increase in mouse survival with hu2B6 MGFc0088 correlated with its increased affinity for the second activating receptor mFc RIV expressed by monocytes macrophages Nimmerjahn F. et al. 2005 23 41 51 . The ability of Fc variants to bind mixed human murine Fc RIII and Fc RII receptors was determined. The results Table 30 indicate that the variants bind to chimeric receptors with substantial equivalence.
