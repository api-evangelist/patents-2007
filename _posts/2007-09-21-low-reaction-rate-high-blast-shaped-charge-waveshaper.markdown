abstract: A shaped charge warhead having a longitudinal axis includes a casing; a liner disposed in the casing; an explosive disposed behind the liner; a wave shaper disposed in the explosive, the wave shaper comprising a low reaction rate high blast reactive material; and a detonator disposed adjacent the explosive. Preferably, the wave shaper is symmetrical about the longitudinal axis.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 465 572 filed on Aug. 18 2006 now abandoned which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application 60 595 999 filed on Aug. 23 2005.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

Shaped charge warheads are used in military applications for the defeat of armored targets. These devices comprise a shaped charge liner typically conical in shape that is backed by a high explosives charge. When the explosive is detonated the expanding gasses collapse the liner onto itself forming a high velocity forward moving jet. As the detonation wave continues to sweep forward more of the liner is collapsed and fed into the jet. Since the jet tip moves faster than the tail the jet stretches as it moves down the shot line the longer it stretches the deeper the penetration.

Wave shaping devices have long been used to alter the collapse dynamics of the shaped charge liner by changing the incident angle and liner sweep velocity of the impinging detonation wave. By directing the detonation front to the warhead periphery parameters such as jet tip velocity accumulated jet mass jet length and jet breakup times can be altered. In particular wave shaping can be used to reduce head height distance between liner apex and detonator while maintaining penetration and thus reducing the overall length of a warhead.

Since World War II traditional wave shaping has been accomplished through mechanical means by inserting a barrier type device in the detonation path to divert the wave to the outside edge of the warhead. Wave shapers can significantly increase penetration performance against armor. In addition the blast output from the contained explosive in the warhead can also be used against other targets such as personnel light vehicles helicopters or structural targets such as buildings and bunkers. However for blast effects the wave shaper volume is parasitic in nature since they are generally made from inert materials. Thus they provide no added explosive output non energy contributing . By replacing these inert wave shaping materials with low reaction rate high blast producing reactive materials the wave shaping volume can be used to produce increased lethal blast effects that are not achievable in current shaped charge warheads.

The explosive output of a reactive wave shaper can be differentiated between blast and incendiary effects. Incendiary devices are designed to start fires and are characterized by high heat output and light. These types of materials provide increased temperature on the target and are primarily good for igniting combustible materials such as diesel fuel or timber structures. U.S. Pat. No. 5 259 317 issued on Nov. 9 1993 shows a hollow charge having a wave guide made of an incendiary material.

Blast output may be characterized by the ability of the system to transfer blast energy to displace a target and perform work. The application of this force over time produces a significant impulse that is capable of knocking down buildings damaging structures and causing lethality due to the blast overpressure. The ability to create an increased pressure impulse is the desired trait for a blast material. Shaped charges having wave shapers formed from low reaction rate high blast producing reactive materials are not known.

It is an object of the invention to provide a shaped charge with a wave shaping device made of a low reaction rate high blast reactive material to increase blast overpressure over time impulse .

It is another object of the invention to provide a shaped charge with a wave shaping device wherein the shaped charge is more lethal than the known shaped charge.

One aspect of the invention is a shaped charge warhead having a longitudinal axis the shaped charge warhead comprising a casing a liner disposed in the casing an explosive disposed behind the liner a wave shaper disposed in the explosive the wave shaper comprising a low reaction rate high blast reactive material and a detonator disposed adjacent the explosive.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Known shaped charge warheads commonly incorporate wave shapers to achieve desired jet characteristics. However for blast effects wave shapers are parasitic volumes because they occupy space that could be occupied by explosive material. By replacing these inert wave shaping materials with low reaction rate high blast producing reactive materials the wave shaping volume can be used to produce increased lethal effects that are not achievable in current shaped charge warheads. In the invention the wave shaping volume is filled with a blast material that produces work to destroy structural targets as opposed to an incendiary material that produces heat and light for burning applications. Good blast producing materials include boron or silicon mixed with oxidizing materials.

The wave shaper comprises a low reaction rate high blast reactive material. A suitable material for the wave shaper is for example powdered silicon or boron or powdered silicon or boron in a plastic matrix. While not required the wave shaper is preferably symmetrical about the longitudinal axis X. The wave shaper is disposed in the explosive between the detonator and the vertex of the liner . In a preferred embodiment the wave shaper is disposed adjacent the rear end of casing with a small amount of explosive disposed between the wave shaper and the rear of the casing. That is the distance from the detonator to the wave shaper is preferably less than the distance from the vertex of the liner to the wave shaper .

In shaped charge warhead the detonator is initiated to set off the booster . The booster creates a detonation wave shown in dotted lines that follows a detonation path shown with arrows in the explosive . As the detonation wave travels it is redirected by the wave shaper to alter the collapse angle of the liner . The detonation wave reaches the liner and a jet forms. After the detonation wave has passed the wave shaper the low reaction rate high blast wave shaper reacts. The wave shaper makes a high blast or is dispersed and subsequently reacts with air to create increased blast. The low reaction rate high blast wave shaper may react by itself or with air depending on its properties.

The method of inserting the wave shaper in the shaped charge warhead may be similar to the known method of inserting an inert wave shaper. The explosive is pressed or cast and then a cavity in the explosive is machined out. The wave shaper is inserted in the cavity. An explosive cap is then glued to the wave shaper explosive assembly.

The inventive warhead uses a low reaction rate high blast reactive material for wave shaper . The warhead produces both high precision shaped charge performance as well as increased blast. This in turn produces increased lethality against a broader range of targets including armor urban structures bunkers and personnel.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
