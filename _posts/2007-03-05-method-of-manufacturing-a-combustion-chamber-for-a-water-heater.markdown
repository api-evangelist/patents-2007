This application is a Divisional of application Ser. No. 10 825 992 filed Apr. 16 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 337 517 the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to fuel fired heating appliances and more particularly a method of manufacturing a combustion chamber of a water heater.

Fuel fired water heaters are generally formed to include a water storage tank with a burner disposed in a combustion chamber. For example gas fired residential and commercial water heaters are generally formed to include a vertical cylindrical water storage tank with a gas burner disposed in a combustion chamber below the tank. In such water heaters the burner is supplied with a fuel gas through a gas supply line and combustion air is supplied through one or more air inlet openings providing communication between ambient air and the interior of the combustion chamber.

In order to permit the flow of combustion air into the combustion chamber while at the same time prevent the outflow of flames from the combustion chamber various proposals have been made to provide the combustion chamber with an exterior wall portion having a spaced series of flame quenching openings formed therein. Such openings may be configured to permit the ingress of combustion air into the combustion chamber while at the same time preventing the passage of combustion chamber flames outwardly through these openings. Accordingly in the event that extraneous flammable vapors enter the combustion chamber with combustion air inwardly traversing these flame quenching openings flames resulting from ignition of the incoming flammable vapor will be contained within the combustion chamber.

A fuel fired heating appliance such as a water heater having an improved perforated combustion chamber flame arrestor plate is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6 422 178 B1 to Lannes et al. entitled FUEL FIRED HEATING APPLIANCE WITH LOUVERED COMBUSTION CHAMBER FLAME ARRESTOR PLATE which is incorporated herein by reference. Such appliances represent an is improvement over prior designs.

However there remains a need for an improved method of manufacturing a portion of a combustion chamber that can be used in water heaters generally including those water heaters having flame arrestor plates.

In one exemplary embodiment this invention provides a method of manufacturing a combustion chamber for use in a water heater. A skirt is formed and an edge portion of a plate is spot welded to the skirt. The edge portion of the plate is circumferentially welded to the skirt thereby forming a seal between the plate and the skirt.

In another exemplary embodiment a further method of manufacturing a combustion chamber for use in a water heater is provided. A skirt is formed. A portion of the skirt is circumferentially expanded and a plate is welded to the expanded portion of the skirt.

In yet another exemplary embodiment a further method of manufacturing a combustion chamber for use in a water heater is provided. A plate having openings is welded to a skirt. A burner support is welded to the plate at a location substantially devoid of the openings.

Although the invention is illustrated and described herein with reference to specific embodiments the invention is not intended to be limited to the details shown. Rather various modifications may be made in the details within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims and without departing from the invention.

Referring to the figures generally a method of manufacturing a portion of a combustion chamber for use in a water heater is provided. A skirt is formed and an edge portion E of a plate is spot welded to the skirt . The edge portion E of the plate is circumferentially welded to the skirt thereby forming a seal between the plate and the skirt .

In another exemplary embodiment a further method of manufacturing at least a portion of a combustion chamber for use in a water heater is provided. A skirt is formed. A portion B of the skirt is circumferentially expanded and a plate is welded to the expanded portion B of the skirt .

In yet another exemplary embodiment a further method of manufacturing a portion of a combustion chamber for use in a water heater is provided. A plate having openings is welded to a skirt . A burner support is welded to the plate at a location S substantially devoid of the openings .

Referring now to a water heater assembly embodying exemplary aspects of this invention is generally designated by the numeral . depicts a commercial or residential water heater. However the descriptions herein apply to commercial water heaters and residential or domestic water heaters as well as other heat transfer systems.

The configuration and operation of the water heater are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6 422 178 B1 to Lannes et al. entitled FUEL FIRED HEATING APPLIANCE WITH LOUVERED COMBUSTION CHAMBER FLAME ARRESTOR PLATE which is incorporated herein in its entirety. A brief description is included herein for contextual purposes.

Water heater has a vertically oriented cylindrical insulated metal storage tank which is adapted to hold a quantity of water to be heated and stored for on demand delivery to a variety of hot water utilizing plumbing fixtures not shown via a supply pipe connected to the top end of the tank . Water drawn from the tank is automatically replenished via a cold water inlet pipe also connected to the top end of the tank .

The tank is representatively supported on a floor in an elevated relationship therewith by depending support legs . At the lower end of the tank is a combustion chamber in which a schematically depicted gas burner structure is operatively supported the burner structure being supplied with fuel gas via a supply line and thermostatically controlled in a conventional manner as a function of the setpoint temperature of the stored water . Combustion chamber has a domed top wall . It is the method of manufacturing a portion best viewed in of the combustion chamber that is the subject of the present invention. A flue extends upwardly from a central portion of the wall through the water and outwardly through the top end of the tank and communicates with the interior of the combustion chamber .

A bottom outer wall portion of the combustion chamber is defined by a flame arrestor plate which embodies principles of the present invention and has a spaced series of flame quenching combustion air inlet openings formed therein. The burner structure is held in an elevated relationship with the top side of the flame arrestor plate by a schematically depicted support structure .

During firing of the water heater ambient combustion air is flowed into the combustion chamber via the air inlet openings mixed with fuel gas delivered to the burner structure and combusted to form hot combustion products that upwardly traverse the flue and transfer combustion heat to the water through the sidewall of the flue .

The arrestor plate inlet openings function to permit combustion air to be drawn upwardly therethrough into the combustion chamber but preclude downward passage through the openings of flames from the interior of the combustion chamber . Accordingly in the event that extraneous flammable vapors are entrained in the combustion air drawn into the combustion chamber and ignited therein the resulting flammable vapor flames are kept in the combustion chamber and tend to be self extinguishing.

Turning now to the flame quenching perforated arrestor plate is representatively formed from an initially imperforate substantially planar metal plate body represented in having an upper side and a lower side not shown and a thickness T which is representatively in the range of from about 0.015 to about 0.040 according to one exemplary embodiment and is preferably about 0.026 according to another exemplary embodiment though other dimensions larger and smaller dimensions are optionally selected.

The flame quenching openings illustrated in are created using a suitable lancing process to form in the plate body parallel rows of upwardly deformed elongated louvers with each of the flame quenching combustion air inlet openings being disposed between a laterally adjacent pair of the louvers . Alternatively the rows of louvers could be staggered or in other relative orientations instead of being parallel. While the use of louvers can be selected according to one embodiment of the invention the openings are optionally formed in other manners. Also the shape quantity size and positioning of the openings can be modified from the embodiment selected for illustration in the figures.

As can best be seen in an exemplary embodiment of the portion of the combustion chamber includes a skirt a flame arrestor plate and a burner support bracket . Generally portion provides a side wall air inlet openings and a burner mounting structure for a combustion chamber such as chamber . While the skirt flame arrestor plate and burner support bracket form a subassembly used to form combustion chamber additional structural elements of the water heater define the remainder of combustion chamber .

For example a domed top wall which can also provide a bottom wall of the storage tank can form a top wall of the combustion chamber . Other elements can also be provided to complete the combustion chamber .

The skirt includes a top circumferential portion T and a bottom circumferential portion B. The plate body has a circular shape and is diametrically configured to cover essentially the entire bottom side of the combustion chamber . Representatively a substantially larger sheet of metal has louvers illustrated in lanced therein and has the circular body suitably removed therefrom. The removed circular body has the louvers crimped down around its periphery to form an annular imperforate peripheral area or edge portion E which facilitates the connection of the body at the bottom portion of the combustion chamber . While the edge portion E illustrated in optionally extends inwardly from the outer edge of circular body the portion of body with crimped louvers is optionally limited to the periphery or side surface of the body .

Alternatively circular body can be formed from a circular imperforate plate in which openings such as those defined by louvers are formed. In this scenario such openings can be formed in the circular body in all locations except at edge portion E.

Additionally louvers found in a rectangular area S are crimped down to form on the top side of the body an imperforate securement area S on which the burner support structure may be suitably mounted. Alternatively the openings defined by louvers can be formed in the circular body in all locations except at edge portion E.

While it is contemplated that the imperforate areas E and S could initially be formed without perforations the exemplary embodiment of body is formed from a substantially larger sheet of metal having louvers and has the circular body suitably removed therefrom. The removed circular body has the louvers crimped down around its edge portion E which facilitates the assembly of the arrestor plate to the remainder of the combustion chamber and at securement area S which facilitates the assembly of the burner support to the arrestor plate .

Portion of the combustion chamber is not illustrated in its assembled configuration. As will be described subsequently herein the assembled portion includes a continuous skirt not shown in its continuous form with the arrestor plate welded to the inner surface I of the skirt and the burner support bracket welded to the securement area S of the arrestor plate .

In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in the figures the only path for air into the combustion chamber is via the inlet openings defined by louvers illustrated in . In order to substantially or completely prevent the flow of air into the combustion chamber at the juncture of the flame arrestor plate and the skirt i.e. where the outer circumferential edge E of the flame arrestor plate meets the inner surface I of the skirt thereby bypassing the inlet openings defined by louvers a seal is provided at the juncture of the flame arrestor plate and the skirt . An exemplary method of manufacturing the portion in such a way as to form the seal will be described in the following paragraphs.

For purposes of illustration however the method illustrated in will now be described in detail. As a first step of the exemplary method blank sheets of metal are pressed in a press room of a manufacturing facility at step . Trays of stacked blank sheets are then transported and staged at step . Each blank sheet is then rolled via a rolling machine at step to form a skirt . This forming step includes rolling the sheet metal to position edges and thereof proximal one another illustrated in . The skirt is then seam welded at step where the edges and of the skirt are seam welded together to form a continuous skirt not shown . At this point the skirt has an inner surface I.

Steps and are optionally carried out by a single machine operated by two operators. It is contemplated that multiple machines can be used and that fewer or more operators may be assigned to operate such machines.

The skirt is then conveyed to an expander and beader machine at step . The bottom portion B of the skirt is circumferentially expanded and the top portion T of the skirt is circumferentially beaded. While these operations are performed by two machines one for expanding and the other for beading it is contemplated that these operation can be performed by fewer or more machines depending upon the configuration of the skirt .

The skirt is then conveyed at step to a spot welding area for spot welding at step . Concurrently arrestor plates and burner support brackets are transported from a central warehouse at step and are staged at step for assembly in the spot welding area at step .

Edge portion E of an arrestor plate is spot welded to the inner surface I of a skirt via a spot welding machine in the spot welding area at step . In other words the edge portion E of the arrestor plate is spot welded to the inner surface of the expanded portion B of the skirt . Specifically the arrestor plate is spot welded at a location adjacent a shoulder formed between the main body of the skirt and the expanded portion B of the skirt . The spot weld may include three spot weld locations in order to fix the arrestor plate to the skirt for further processing. Though two or more spot welds may be helpful to maintain an alignment between the arrestor plate and the skirt a single spot weld is contemplated as well.

A burner support bracket is spot welded to the imperforate securement area S of arrestor plate . If an imperforated securement area S was not previously formed a rectangular area S can be crimped down to form such an imperforate securement area S on which the burner support structure may be suitably mounted. In other words if louvers exist on the arrestor plate where the burner support bracket is to be welded to the arrestor plate a portion of such louvers can be substantially closed.

The spot welding operations performed in step can be performed by two spot welding machines one for spot welding the burner support bracket to the arrestor plate and the other for spot welding the arrestor plate to the skirt . It is also contemplated that these operations can be performed by a single machine.

At this point the three components illustrated in i.e. the skirt the arrestor plate and the burner support bracket are preliminarily assembled to form the portion of the combustion chamber .

As represented by symbol the flow chart representation of the method of manufacturing the portion of the combustion chamber continues from to . The portion assembly of the combustion chamber is then conveyed at step to a circumferential welding machine in a circumferential welding area in step . The edge portion E of the arrestor plate is circumferentially welded to the inner surface I of the skirt thereby forming a seal between the arrestor plate and the inner surface of the skirt . More specifically a continuous weld is formed at or near the circumferential edge E of the arrestor plate where it meets the inner surface I of the skirt . Thus a continuous weld bead is formed thereby preventing the flow of air between the edge E of the arrestor plate and the inner surface I of the arrestor plate .

At this point the portion of the combustion chamber is fully assembled. The assembly is then moved to a staging area at step transported at step to a storage area at step and placed in tankyard storage at step . The combustion chamber portion can then be used in the assembly of a water heater .

While preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described herein it will be understood that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations changes and substitutions will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example while the flame arrestor plate body illustratively has a circular shape and covers essentially the entire bottom end of the combustion chamber it could have a different shape and cover a lesser or greater portion of the bottom end of the combustion chamber . For example the plate body could have a rectangular shape and be an insert in a portion of a larger imperforate metal plate complementarily mounted within the open bottom end of the combustion chamber .

Also the exemplary method illustrated in the figures can be modified within the scope of this invention. For example the order of the steps is not critical to the invention and steps can be added or removed to the method depending upon details of the design of the combustion chamber .

Accordingly it is intended that the appended claims cover all such variations as fall within the spirit and scope of the invention.
