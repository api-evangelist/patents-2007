The subject matter of this application was made with support from the United States Government under Grant No. CTS 0403692 from the National Science Foundation. The United States Government may retain certain rights in the invention.

The present invention is directed to nano composite membranes and methods for making them. More specifically the present invention is directed to nano composite membranes with oriented single walled carbon nanotubes and methods for making these membranes.

Carbon nanotubes CNTs have been identified as fundamentally new nanoporous materials that show great potential for sensors composites catalytic supports and as membrane materials.In particular CNTs which may have an inner core diameter as small as 4 have been earmarked as possible selective nanopores in membrane materials.

Previous studies by Hunt et al.have shown that SiNcomposite membranes with aligned double walled carbon nanotubes DWNT having a diameter of about 1.6 nm show gas flow through that is one to two orders of magnitude faster than that obtained with a commercial polycarbonate nanoporous membrane having 15 nm pore size. These studies have also found that liquid water flow through these nanotube membranes was more than three orders of magnitude faster than expected from hydrodynamic flow calculations. Moreover these nanotube membranes exhibited extraordinarily high size exclusion selectivity. In related work Hinds et al.constructed polymer nanotube composite membranes using multiwalled carbon nanotubes MWNT having large diameters 6 7 nm . Further study of these composite membranes verified that transport of liquids alkanes water is orders of magnitude faster than can be accounted for by conventional hydrodynamic flow.

Although composite membranes made with DMNTs and MWNTs have shown promising results the use of single walled nanotubes SWNTs for forming membranes is particularly intriguing. Recently computer simulations have been used to investigate the adsorption selectivity and transport propertiesof light gases in SWNTs. Johnson et al. have identified single walled carbon nanotubes as a fundamentally new nanoporous material that shows great potential for membrane materials.That group reported transport rates in nanotubes to be orders of magnitude faster than in zeolites and demonstrated that the exceptionally high transport rates are a result of the inherent smoothness of the nanotubes.

In addition to allowing the fast transport rates afforded by all CNTs SWNTs are smaller diameter carbon nanotubes with 4 to 12 pore openings in a size range that may allow for size selection of gas mixtures. Recent computer simulation work by Sholl et al. has shown that SWNT membranes should be strongly selective for CHover Hand should have flux selectivity properties that far exceed those of any other known inorganic materials.

In order for SWNTs to effectively act as channels in a membrane however they must to be aligned correctly relative to the penetrant stream. This alignment is perhaps the single most important challenge facing the fabrication of SWNT membranes.

Chemical vapor deposition has been used to grow oriented carbon nanotubes.While chemical vapor deposition produces well aligned carbon nanotubes the process is expensive tedious and is limited to fabricating samples with small surface areas e.g. sub cm . In an alternative approach CNTs have been aligned by employing filtration methods.However to date filtration has been successful only with MWNTs.

As such there remains a need in the art for a method for an facile efficient and inexpensive manner for forming composite membranes with aligned CNTs especially SWNTs.

It is an object of the present invention to provide composite membranes having a layer of oriented carbon nanotubes fixed in a polymer matrix. The composite membrane is configured to allow for the rapid transport of a permeate molecule or compound through the membrane. Further the composite membranes may be configured to allow the transport of specific molecules or compounds while preventing others from being transported or slowing the transport of other molecules or compounds so that the membranes are capable of separating specific species from one another.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for making a composite membrane having a layer of oriented carbon nanotubes that is facile efficient and cost effective. The present invention provides methods for orienting carbon nanotubes by filtration. The methods provided by the present invention may be used with any type of carbon nanotube including single walled double walled and multi walled carbon nanotubes.

It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a method for orienting carbon nanotubes by filtration where the carbon nanotubes have been modified to have chemical functional groups on their surfaces. The chemically modified carbon nanotubes have functional groups that facilitate better alignment of carbon nanotubes.

The present invention is directed to composite membranes having oriented carbon nanotubes CNTs and to facile methods for forming these membranes. In order for the composite membrane to be functional and efficient a substantial proportion of the CNTs in the membrane should be oriented so that they are aligned parallel to the direction of the flow of the membrane penetrant.

The composite membranes of the present invention are formed from at least CNTs and a polymer matrix. The polymer matrix serves to provide structural support to the composite membrane and to maintain the orientation of the CNTs. Other layers or functionalities such as other polymers or chemical modifying groups can also be used to construct the composite membranes of the present invention as will be described in further detail below.

In certain embodiments of the present invention the carbon nanotubes CNT starting material used in forming the membranes of the present invention is made up of single walled carbon nanotubes SWNTs . Examples of SWNTs that may be used in embodiments of the invention include those synthesized using an electric arc discharge method such as SWNTs produced by Carbon Solutions inc. of Riverside Calif. or CarboLex Inc. of Broomall Pa. The SWNTs may also be synthesized using chemical vapor depositionor high pressure CO disproportionationmethods known in the art. It is also contemplated that other types of CNTs may be used in embodiments of the present invention such as multi walled carbon nanotubes MWNTs and double walled carbon nanotubes DVWNTs .

It is preferable that the composite membranes of the present invention are made with CNTs having a diameter small enough to allow for size selection in fluid mixtures such as a gas mixture. The CNTs in the composite membrane will preferably have a diameter size and other properties that are appropriate for allowing a specific permeate molecule or compound in a fluid mixture to pass through the composite membrane while preventing other molecules or compounds from passing through the membrane. Preferably the CNTs used in the composite membranes of the present invention have diameter sizes of about 0.8 nm to about 50 nm although other diameter sizes are contemplated.

After CNT starting material is obtained the CNTs may be treated by a multistage purification process which may or may not involve cutting the CNTs into tubes of smaller length. This process may involve wet oxidation and or acid treatment of the CNTs. Examples of such purification and cutting processes are known in the art such as the processes described by Chiang et al.and by Liu et al..

After purification and or cutting the CNTs may then be modified with one or more chemical groups as described. Chemically modified CNTs may have a variety of chemical functional groups attached to the CNT including but not limited to carboxylic acid amine alkane alkene alkyne alkoxy ether ester cyano silyl sulfonic acid phosphoric acid and boronic acid functional groups. These attached functional groups may then be further modified both covalently and non covalently. In certain embodiments of the invention the functional groups are formed as zwitterions on the surface of the CNTs. In one embodiment of the present invention the zwitterion formed is a CNT carboxylate octadecylammonium zwitterion such as those described by Chen et al.. The CNTs used in the present invention may be chemically modified to increase or decrease their solubility in specific solvents or may be modified for other reasons.

After modification of CNTs further purification and extraction methods may be necessary to purify the modified CNTs and to remove unreacted reagents. These purification and extraction methods may involve washing the CNTs in a suitable solvent followed by filtration and drying steps to remove the solvent.

Once any optional purification and modification steps are performed a dispersion of the CNTs may be made in a solvent or a surfactant. Use of various solvents or surfactants that allow for efficient dispersion and alignment of the CNTs is contemplated. If a solvent is used various concentrations of the CNTs in the solvent are contemplated. In certain embodiments of the present invention solvent concentrations of less than about 10 10 wt of CNTs are contemplated although the concentration may be higher. In certain embodiments of the invention the solvent used for dispersion of the CNTs is chosen from tetrahydrofuran THF 1 4 dioxane acetone acetonitrile dimethylfornamide dimethylsulfoxide or the like. However there may be other solvents more suitable for dispersion of the CNTs depending on the type of chemical functional group that may be present on the CNT. For example if a hydrophobic functional group has been added to the CNT it may be more desirable to disperse the CNT in a non polar solvent such as diethylether hexane benzene toluene chloroform ethyl acetate dichloromethane or the like.

If a surfactant is used a variety of CNT surfactant ratios may be used for dispersion and alignment of the CNTs. In certain embodiments CNT surfactant ratios of about 1 5 to about 1 15 are contemplated although other values outside of this range may also be used. The surfactant may be any surfactant that allows for the desired dispersion of the CNTs. In certain embodiments of the present invention the surfactant is sodium dodecylsulfonate sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate ammonium lauryl sulfate sodium laureth sulfate alkyl benzene sulfonate or the like.

The dispersed CNTs are then passed through a filter causing a majority of the CNTs to form a layer in which they are oriented in a direction perpendicular to the filter i.e. standing up on the filter.

A variety of filters may be used for orienting CNTs. The filters may be made of different polymeric materials and asymmetric membrane supports including hydrophobic materials such as polyfluoroethylene PTFE and polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF or hydrophilic materials such as polypropylene polyethersulfone PES and nylon. The type of filter may vary depending on the presence and type of chemical modifications on the CNTs to be filtered. The pore size of the filter used may also vary considerably. In certain embodiments of the present invention the pore size is about 0.22 m or smaller. However other larger pore sizes such as pore sizes of about 0.22 m to about 1.0 m are contemplated. Almost any pore size that is small enough to allow for retention of the majority of CNTs being filtered.

In certain embodiments of the present invention if the CNTs are modified with hydrophilic functional groups such as zwittenrons then the filter may be made of a hydrophobic polymeric material. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is thought that especially well aligned layers of CNTs can be obtained if the CNTs have hydrophilic chemical modifications and the filter is made of a hydrophobic material. As the hydrophobic filter tends to repel the hydrophilic modified groups of the CNTs the hydrophilically modified CNTs will have a tendency to self assemble into a well oriented layer. In other embodiments of the present invention the properties of the CNTs and the filter may be reversed i.e. the CNTs may be modified with hydrophobic functional groups and then filtered onto a hydrophilic filter.

After a layer of oriented CNTs is formed on the filter the polymer matrix may be applied. The polymer matrix may be applied according to various techniques known to one of skill in the art.

The polymer matrix of the composite membranes of the present invention may be made from various polymeric compounds. In certain embodiments of the present invention the polymeric matrix may be formed from a polyimide a polysulfone a poly dimethysiloxane a cellulose acetate a polycarbonate a polymethacrylate or another thermoplastic or glassy polymer. Examples of specific polymers which may be used include polysulfone PSF UDEL P 3500 from Solvay Advanced Polymers L.L.C. of Alpharetta Ga. and poly dimethysiloxane PDMS RTV615 from Momentive Performance Materials Inc. of Wilton Conn.

In certain embodiments of the present invention the polymer matrix is applied using a spin coating method. For applying the polymer matrix with a spin coating method a solution of the polymer is prepared. Although other more concentrated solutions of polymer matrix may be used it is preferred that the polymer solution is diluted to a concentration of less than about 10 by weight. The polymer solution may then be added dropwise onto the filtered aligned CNTs and allowed to penetrate into the CNT layer. After the polymer solution is given time to penetrate the CNTs may be spin coated for a sufficient period of time at a sufficient rotational speed as is known in the art. In certain embodiments of the present invention the CNTs may be spin coated for about 5 20 seconds at rotational speeds of about 1000 to about 2000 rpm. The spin coated CNTs are then allowed to dry until they reach sufficient dryness for example the spin coated CNTs may be allowed to dry for one day at room temperature.

In other embodiments of the present invention the polymer matrix is applied by spraying a polymer solution having a concentration similar to the one described above onto a glass plate. The oriented CNTs may then be transferred onto the glass plate by pressing the CNT side of the filter onto the layer of the polymer solution on the glass plate. The coated CNTs are then allowed to dry until they reach sufficient dryness for example the spin coated CNTs may be allowed to dry for one day at room temperature.

Regardless of the method used to form the oriented CNT polymeric matrix composite membrane the membranes may then be placed under vacuum and heated to the glass transition temperature of the polymer which composes the polymer matrix for an amount of time sufficient to anneal the membrane. For example if PSF is used for forming the polymer matrix the membranes may be placed under vacuum and heated to about 458 K for a period of approximately 1 hour.

After the composite membranes are formed they may be used as is or further modified. In certain embodiments of the invention the filter membrane used for alignment of the CNTs may be removed from the composite membranes. In other embodiments additional layers of membranes or polymers may be added to confer additional properties to the composite membranes. For example additional layers may be added to the composite membranes in order to modify their permeability. It is further contemplated that in certain embodiments chemical modifications may be made to either the CNTs or the polymeric matrix.

The composite membranes of the present invention are preferably used for highly efficient separation of permeate molecules or compounds in a fluid stream. In certain embodiments of the invention the permeability of the membrane is due almost exclusively to the flow of fluid through the CNTs. However it is also contemplated that specific polymer matrices that are at least slightly permeable to specific permeate molecules or compounds may also be used.

The composite membranes of the present invention are meant to be highly permeable to specific fluids and exhibit high flux for specific fluids. Preferably the composite membranes of the present invention show flux and permeability for specific fluids that is greater than that described by the Knudsen flow model. Further non limiting descriptions of some of the desired properties for the composite membranes of the present invention are set forth in the Examples below.

It is contemplated that the composite membranes may have a number of uses beyond general separation of permeate molecules or compounds. Such uses include but are not limited to use in respirators use for desalinization use as delivery channels for drug delivery use in chemical sensing apparatuses use for protein purification and use in the separation of mixed gases.

In their use in respirators the composite membranes of the present invention may be specifically constructed to allow the free exchange of air and CO while preventing the transmission of infective agents such as viruses and bacteria through the membrane thus allowing the wearer of the respirator to breathe freely in an environment where airborne infective agents are present.

In their use for desalinization the composite membranes may be specifically constructed so as to allow water to pass freely through the composite membrane while retaining salt compounds.

In their use for drug delivery the composite membranes may be used to construct drug delivery devices that allow for controlled delivery of specific therapeutic agents including small molecule drugs proteins and nucleic acids.

In their use in chemical sensing apparatuses the composite membranes may only allow specific molecules or compounds to pass through to a detecting sensor allowing for high specificity of chemical sensing.

In their use for protein purification the composite membranes may be specifically constructed to allow only a protein of interest to pass through the membrane allowing the protein of interest to be substantially purified. Alternatively the composite membranes may be specifically constructed so that they retain a protein of interest which can later be eluted from the membrane in a substantially purified state.

In their use for separation of mixed gasses the composite membranes may be specifically constructed so that specific molecules or compounds in gas mixture pass through the membrane at a different rate allowing for the substantial separation of the molecules and compounds from one another. Alternatively for mixed gas separation the composite membranes may he constructed so that a specific molecule or compound in a gas mixture may pass through the membrane while other compounds are not able to pass the membrane. Also alternatively for mixed gas separation the composite membranes may be constructed so that a specific molecule or compound in a gas mixture is reversibly retained by the membrane. After retention by the membrane the specific molecule or compound can then be released from the membrane and collected in substantially purified form.

In all potential uses of the composite membranes of the present invention variations may be made in CNT pore size CNT chemical modifications and the polymer matrix which will allow for the specificity needed for the specific application.

The description of the present invention set forth herein including the Examples set forth below is meant to provide non limiting description of the compositions and methods of the present invention. It should be apparent that there are variations of the present invention not explicitly presented in this specification that fall within the scope and the spirit of the invention as claimed.

The transport properties of SWNT polymer nano composite membranes fabricated by orienting functionalized SWNT with a filtration method are described herein. It is believed that the alignment of the SWNT results from a self assembly mechanism directed by the shear forces of the flowing solvent stream in combination with repulsive forces between the carbon nanotubes and the nearby membrane filter surface. It has been reported that shear forces align SWNTs in the flow direction.The SWNTs samples orient in shear flow and propagate their perpendicular alignment to the filter substrate via long range repulsive forces that exist between the zwitterions attached to the carbon nanotube surface. This phenomena is similar to the orientation behaviour of rigid rodlike polyelectrolytes near charged surfaces.

Electric arc discharged SWNTs were purchased from Carbon Solutions Inc. Riverside Calif. . Raw carbon nanotube materials were treated by multistage purification a combination of wet oxidation and acid treatments to purify SWNTs from impurities and cut into small length with 3 1 mixture of concentrated HSO 98 vol HNO 70 vol solution. The details of the purification and cutting method are described elsewhere.To produce soluble CNTs an octadecylammonium ODA and SWNT Carboxylate zwitterions were formed as described.Shortened CNTs were heated with ODA at 393 K for 96 hours. After cooling to room temperature the black colored ODA and CNT mixture was washed with tetrahydrofuran THF and filtered through a membrane filter 0.2 m . Because unreacted ODA was expected to block the entrance to the channels of SWNTs ODA was further removed by Soxhlet extraction in ethanol at 393 K for 10 days.

Arc discharge SWNTs were treated using a mixture of HSOHNOto cut the nanotubes into small lengths and open end tips.The average pore diameter of the SWNT estimated from porosimetry measurements is 1.2 nm. The pore size distribution is shown in . It has been reported that acids can be intercalated into SWNT bundles and disintegrate the tube walls into graphitic flakes and then reform them into MWNTs.After acid treatment the prepared CNTs samples are mostly composed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes or transformed SWNTs created during the oxidation shown in and bundled SWNTs shown in . The transformed SWNTs have pore diameters of less than 2 nm and are surrounded by multilayered graphitic shells and amorphous like carbon materials .

Filtered and dried functionalized CNTs and were dispersed in tetrahydrofuran THF using ultra sonication for 30 min. The dilute CNT THF solution 6.7 10wt of CNT was then filtered through a 0.2 m pore size hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE Millipore filter. Vertically aligned CNTs remained on the filter support. This assembly was then dried at room temperature for 8 hours and subsequently coated with a thin PSF UDEL P 3500 Solvay or PDMS RTV615 GE layer using dilute 

CNT nano composite membranes are prepared by dispersing amine functionalized carbon nanotubes in THF and filtering this solution through a PTFE filter. The oriented carbon nanotubes remaining on the filter are coated with a thin polysulfone PSF layer. Polysulfone was chosen as the matrix to impart the membrane with mechanical strength and to seal the structure. The schematic of this process along with an actual image of the membrane film are shown in . shows the scanning electron microcopy SEM images of the CNTs on top of a PTFE membrane filter. Most of the nanotubes are standing up although some are not fully aligned vertically to the membrane filter. An SEM image of the composite film in shows that spin coating the polymer from a dilute solution allows the polymer to penetrate well around the nanotubes and allows most nanotube tips to be slightly exposed above the polymer matrix. The thickness of the carbon nanotube polymer layer is about 600 nm. Nanocomposite membrane with an additional polydimethylsiloxane PDMS coating on top of the original carbon nanotubes PSF system has also been prepared. This structure is shown in

CNT polymer nanoporous membrane samples for high resolution TEM experiments in cross sectional orientation were prepared by an ultramicrotoming method. After embedding the membrane in a resin slices having a thickness less than 50 nm have been cut using a standard diamond microtome knife. The slices were placed onto a meshed copper TEM grid for support. Finally the TEM specimen was coated with a thin amorphous carbon film prior to the TEM experiment to prevent specimen charging and to minimize beam damage. High resolution TEM observations were made on a FEI Titan XT at 200 keV. The post column Gatan Image Filter GIF has been utilized for zero loss ZL filtered imaging with an energy slit width of 10 eV to improve image contrast and visibility of the graphene layers in CNTs by minimizing the blurring that is caused by inelastic scattering.

High resolution transmission electron microcopy HRTEM images of the CNT cross sections in a polymer matrix are shown in . These images have been used to estimate the area density of the carbon nanotubes which is 7.0 1.75 10nanotubes per cm. Similar to HRTEM images of the acid treated CNTs sample in and HRTEM images of nanotubes in the polymer matrix reveal mostly two types of structures namely encapsulated SWNT bundles and SWNTs with additional graphite sheets as shown in . A single SWNT which has been transformed into a MWNT by encapsulation with additional graphite layers is shown in . It is likely that the increase in outer diameter of the transformed SWNT also aids in the vertical orientation of the carbon nanotube during the filtration process.

The quality of the CNT PSF composite membrane has been tested by measuring its permeation to helium. In general the transport of pure gases through a porous membrane can be described by one of three mechanisms viscous flow Knudsen diffusion and surface flow.Knudsen diffusion occurs when the mean free path of the gas molecules is larger than the pore radius r of the membrane and there are more collisions with the pore walls than between gas molecules. When r becomes much larger than 1 r as would be the case for gas transport in pinholes and other structural defects viscous flow dominates the gas transport mechanism. Therefore high quality membranes can be characterized by the absence of viscous flow and more by Knudsen like diffusion. For porous membranes which are governed by Knudsen diffusion a plot of permeability versus average pressure should give a horizontal line because gas transport in a Knudsen regime is independent of the feed pressure. Alternatively the permeation should increase with increasing pressure across the membrane when viscous flow takes place. As shown in the helium permeance through the CNT membranes is independent of the pressure drop across the membrane. This is evidence that there is no viscous flow through any large pinholes and that the prepared SWNT membrane is defect free.

When Knudsen diffusion occurs membrane permeance is inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight of the permeating gas molecule. shows the effective gas permeability in the three oriented CNTs polymer nanocomposite membranes as a function of the square root of the reciprocal of the gas molecular weight M. The solid line represents the Knudsen flow model. While the permeabilities of all samples are approximately proportional to M the absolute permeability of the CNTs PSF membrane is significantly higher than that predicted by Knudsen diffusion. This indicates that the gas transport in this sample takes place primarily through the carbon nanotubes with very little transport through the ultra thin polymer matrix. This gas flow enhancement above the Knudsen regime is consistent with the atomistic simulations discussed previouslyand the previous experimental observations of Holt et al.On the other hand the permeabilities of the sample having additional polymer coating CNTs PSF PDMS are lower than those predicted by the Knudsen diffusion model. This decrease in permeability is proportional to the transport resistance offered by the additional polymer layer. Some of the deviation of COpermeance from the Knudsen scaling in this membrane is due the higher sorption of COin the PDMS layer relative to the other gases.

To further probe these mixture results previous atomistic simulations were adapted to examine transport of CO CHmixtures in single CNTs. These simulations describe defect free 10 10 nanotubes diameter 1.36 nm of infinite extent.By separately computing adsorption isotherms and loading dependent transport diffusion coefficients predictions can be made for permeation through CNT membranes.Binary adsorption isotherms were predicted by applying Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory IAST to the single component isotherms from atomistic simulations. IAST is known to be accurate for these systems.Binary transport diffusivities were predicted from the single component diffusivities from atomistic simulations using the methods of Skoulidas Sholl and Krishna SSK .This method has been shown to be accurate for a range of similar systems via detailed atomistic simulations of mixture diffusion.A broad range of feed pressures compositions and transmembrane pressure drops have been explored with these calculations they predict CO CHselectivities varying between 2 10 depending on operating conditions. For conditions similar to the performed experiments 50 50 feed. 50 psi feed 0.7 psi permeate our calculations predict a CO CHselectivity of 5.1. Experiments with a COmole fraction of 0.2 0.5 and 0.8 in the membrane feed using three different nano composite membranes were also performed. The averaged experimental results along with the theoretical predictions are shown in . The error bars on the experimental data reflect the variability of the sample preparation method. The theoretical predictions give mixture selectivities that are considerably larger than the experimental observations. The predictions do however reproduce the non Knudsen selectivity of the experiments. Briefly the diffusion of isolated molecules in our simulations differs from Knudsen diffusion because both species adsorb on the walls of CNTs and individual collisions between molecules and the CNT walls do not completely thermalize the molecular momenta.In the mixture the more strongly adsorbing COpartially excludes CHfrom CNTs and the slower diffusing COmolecules reduce the mobility of adsorbed CH. Both of these effects increase the selectivity of the membrane relative to the result of single gas operation.

There are three important caveats in comparing these atomistic calculations with the experimental data. First the calculations are based solely on 10 10 CNTs. The importance of adsorption in larger CNTs is likely to be lower than in the relatively small pores of 10 10 CNTs. Diffusion coefficients for COfrom atomistic simulations are known to decrease as pore sizes increase but insufficient data is currently available to accurately predict the properties of permeating mixtures in these CNTs. Second the calculations assumed that membrane transport is dominated by intra pore diffusion. In short enough nanotubes however transport resistances associated with entering and leaving pores may also contribute. Estimates of these resistances for 10 10 nanotubes for CHpermeation indicate that they may not be negligible for CNTs of the lengths observed in our experiment 

In summary the filtration method presented here facilitates the orientation of carbon nanotubes on porous supports and can be easily adapted to large scale membrane formation. The resulting nanocomposite membranes have the same fast gas transport properties as those observed in carbon nanotube membranes grown by chemical vapor deposition. These results include the first characterization of gas mixture transport through CNT based membranes. These results also indicate that it is possible to achieve rapid transport through CNT membranes that deviates from Knudsen selectivities.

Electric arc discharged single walled carbon nanotubes SWNTs were purchased from Carbon Solutions Inc. Riverside Calif. . Raw carbon nanotube materials produced by electric arc method were treated by multistage purification method a combination of wet oxidation and acid treatments to purify CNTs from impurities and cut into small length with 3 1 mixture of concentrated HSO 98 vol HNO 70 vol solution. The details of the purification and cutting method are described elsewhere.Nitrogen sorption isotherms at 77 K were carried out to characterize the pore structure. The pore size of CNTs was calculated using the Horvath Kawazoe H K model for cylindrical pores.To produce soluble SWNTs formed an octadecylammonium ODA and SWNT Carboxylate zwitterions was formed by the following procedure.Shortened SWNTs were heated with ODA at 393 K for 96 hours. After cooling to room temperature the black colored ODA and SWNTs mixture was washed with tetrahydrofuran THF and filtered through a membrane filter 0.2 m . Because unreacted ODA were expected to block the entrance to the channels of SWNTs ODA was further removed by Soxhlet extraction in ethanol at 393 K for 10 days.

In order to form an oriented CNT on the membrane filter the funtionalized CNTs were dispersed in THF solution by the ultra sonication. The well dispersed CNTs solution then filtered through 0.2 m pore size hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE filter Fluoropre membrane filter Millipore . Because the CNTs were modified hydrophilic amine groups the CNTs tend to stand up on the hydrophobic membrane filter and self assemble into an oriented film. The prepared oriented CNTs on membrane filter were dried at room temperature for 1 day. In order to coat very thin polymer on CNTs 5 wt polysulfone PSF solution in chloroform was sprayed on glass plate and then the oriented CNTs film on PTFE filter was immediately transferred onto a glass plate by pressing the CNT coated side of the filter onto the thin polymer solution. The metal disk was on the top of membrane filter side allowing for a PSF film with a uniform and thin thickness to avoid excess polymer layer without curling. The glass substrate was covered with a glass cover to slow the evaporation of solvent. The solutions were given 1 day to dry at room temperature. Once dry the films were placed under vacuum and the temperature was raised to PSF glass transition temperature 458 K for 1 hour and then cooled down to room temperature.

FESEM LEO 1550 was used to study the morphology of the membranes. Permeabilities of the polymeric and composite membranes were measured using a constant volume varying pressure apparatus. Permeability was measured directly and the Time Lag Method was applied to the recorded data to determine the diffusivity coefficient. The solubility coefficient was taken as the ratio of the permeability to diffusivity coefficient. The gases used in this research were He CO O N and CH. Each gas possessed a purity of 99.99 and was used as received from Air Products. The feed pressure and temperature were kept constant at 4 atm and 308 K respectively for all experiments. Each gas was run through a membrane six times and the average results and the standard deviations were recorded.

Pore diameter of the SWNT sample was calculated by the Horvath Kawazoe H K method . The H K method used here was derived for cylindrical pores. The distribution in micropore diameter of the SWNT ranges from 0.95 to 1.9 nm showing strong peak intensity at 1.2 nm. Therefore the average pore diameter of the SWNT in this study is estimated to be 1.2 nm.

FIG. shows the SEM images of the SWNT on a PTFE membrane filter with a thin nanotube layer of ca. 2 m thickness. Most of the nanotubes are standing up although they are not fully oriented vertically to the membrane filter. After PSF coating the SEM image of a composite film shows that the polymer is well penetrated through the nanotube layer without excess polymer coating on top of the SWNT .

The quality of the CNT PSF composite membranes was examined by the helium gas permeation studies. In general the gas permeation mechanism through the mesopores 5 nm such as pinhole defects molecular diffusion and viscous flow contribute to the gas transport. In single component measurements molecular diffusion can be negligible because molecular diffusion is dominated by molecule molecule collisions between two different gas species. Therefore the quality of the membranes can be characterized by the absence of the contribution of viscous flow to the total transport as shown in . The permeance increases with increasing pressure across the membrane when viscous flow takes place while the permeance in the case of Knudsen diffusion is not affected by the changes in pressure. The He permeances through the CNT membranes were independent of the pressure drop across the membrane. Therefore the constant permeance with pressure in the nanotube membrane strongly suggest that there is no contribution of viscous flow resulted from large pinholes and the prepared SWNT membrane is defect free.

When the mean free path is larger than the channel dimensions d and particle surface collisions dominate over particle particle collisions the Knudsen diffusion model is frequently applied. The pore geometry of the SWNT membrane in our study is characterized by Knudsen numbers d 1 but the flux measured in Table 1 exceeded the flux predicted by the Knudsen flow model. The gas flow enhancement is most likely caused by the intrinsic smoothness of the CNT surface as predicted by the atomistic simulation of gas flow through SWNTs.The enhancements over the Knudsen model are much larger for CHand COthan He O and N because CNTs have higher adsorption properties of CNTs for CHand COresulting from amine pendent groups at the pore entrance.

Table 2 shows the permeability of oriented SWNT membrane compared with PSF 10 wt randomly oriented SWNTs PSF mixed matrix membrane MMM and the Knudsen flow model for SWNTs membrane. For the disoriented SWNT PSF MMM sample the maximum loading occurs at 10 wt SWNT because a maximum permeability reached and decreased for loading 15 wt . As shown in Table 2 gas permeabilities of polymer increased with the addition of nanotube. The permeabilities through oriented SWNT membrane sample exceeded the permeabilities of PSF and disoriented SWNT PSF sample by at least one to three orders of magnitude. In addition the oriented nanotube membrane sample showed higher permeability than predicted by the Knudsen model by one order of magnitude.

Table 3 and show gas selectivities of an oriented SWNT membrane. For He O and N the selectivity exhibited the inverse square root of the molecular mass by the Knudsen diffusion model. However CHand COdeviated from the Knudsen separation factor showing a higher selectivity. These deviations can be explained by the preferential interaction of CNTs with CHand CO. Gas adsorption of various gases on CNTs has shown strong adsorption of CHand COover H O and N.In addition amine functional groups at the CNTs tips to disperse nanotubes in THF solution provide sites for COadsorption and enhance COselectivity.

This is the first report of the gas transport properties of SWNT membranes using the functionalized SWNT and commercial polymer. A simple fast commercially attractive and scalable filtration method to prepare an oriented CNT membrane with a large surface area has been demonstrated. The gas transport of the SWNT exceeded the permeabilities of PSF and disoriented SWNT PSF sample by at least one to three orders of magnitude. In addition the oriented nanotube membrane sample showed higher permeability than the predicted value by the Knudsen model by one order of magnitude. The SWNT membrane also shows higher selectivities of CHand COover other gas molecules because of preferential interaction of CHand COwith the nanotubes demonstrating practical applications in gas separations.

A nanotube dispersion with a concentration of 0.01 mg ml was mixed with surfactant e.g. sodium dodecylsulfonate sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate .The optimum CNT surfactant ratio can be varied from 1 5 to 1 15. The suspension was sonicated for 2 days. The high concentration of the CNT suspension 20 ml was diluted with deionized water 50 ml . The low concentration CNT suspension 10 ml was filtered through membrane filter. The filter was rinsed several times to remove surfactant on the CNTs. The aligned CNTs were then dried at room temperature.
