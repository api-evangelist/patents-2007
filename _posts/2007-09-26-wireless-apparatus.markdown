The present invention is related to a wireless apparatus such as a synchronizing apparatus which controls variable signal delaying unit based upon information acquired from data sampling unit so as to synchronize sampling timing with respect mainly to an inputted signal.

In high speed wireless communication techniques for employing pulse communication systems which are typically known as UWB Ultra Wide Band since linearity is not always required wireless communication apparatuses may be suitably manufactured by utilizing CMOSs Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors and thus may be made compact. Also since RF circuits such as high precision local signal sources are not required wireless communication apparatuses are operable under low power consumption. Moreover since wide bands are utilized wireless communication apparatuses may realize high speed communications.

However although the wireless communication apparatuses have the above described merits since data sampling operations for pulse shaped signals shorter than or equal to 1 nsec are carried out synchronous pull in operations within short times are required and high precision tracking operations are required which constitute one of unrealizable problems thereof.

As conventional sample timing generating circuits for generating sample timing that is synchronized with respect to inputted signals clock data recovery circuits constructed of analog components such as LPFs Low Pass Filters and VCOs voltage Controlled Oscillators have been provided refer to for example patent publication 1 .

Also synchronizing apparatuses have been provided in which inputted signals are over sampled sampling timing errors are calculated from these over sampled data and phases timing of clocks generated by oscillators are adjusted so that the generated clocks are synchronized with the inputted signal refer to for instance patent publication 2 .

Then the generated pulses are averaged by an LPF and a voltage of the averaged pulse is amplified by a GCA Gain Controlled Amplifier and a clock signal having a frequency corresponding to this amplified voltage is generated by a VCO . Since timing of the clock signal is adjusted by a variable phase shifter based upon the clock signal generated by the VCO and the timing adjusted clock signal is supplied to the discriminator such a clock data recovery circuit capable of obtaining the extracted clock signal that is synchronized with the input signal DIN is arranged.

However in the method for using the analog components such as the LPF and the VCO the time constant becomes long so that a lengthy time is required in the synchronous pull in operation. Also in the method for executing the over sampling process operation since the synchronizing apparatus is arranged by the interpolator the NCO Number Controlled Oscillator and the like the arrangement thereof becomes complex. As a consequence as synchronizing methods that are particularly specialized in pulse communications the below mentioned methods have been proposed which may track synchronizations by acquiring correlations among respective signals that have been delayed before and after a reference time refer to for instance patent publication 3 .

With employment of this arrangement the received RF signal is amplified by the amplifier so as to become such an RF signal having an amplitude required in a demodulation an unnecessary frequency band thereof outside the relevant band is eliminated by the filter and then an analog code is produced by the analog coding unit . This signal is split by the splitter and then 3 pieces of signals delayed by the delaying devices and are outputted. That is a signal delayed by a time L a signal delayed by a time L Y and a signal delayed by a time L Y are outputted.

A reference pulse signal produced by the main reception wavelet code producing device is multiplied with respect to these three signals by the multipliers and respectively. Then the multiplied pulse signals are integrated by times corresponding to the respective symbols by the integrators and . The reception synchronizing control unit judges synchronizations in response to correlations among the respective signals and outputs decoded data while the reception synchronizing control unit controls the phase delaying unit so as to perform the sliding synchronization.

At this time while the reception pulse signal at the time L is defined as the reference of the correlation in such a case that the correlation of the signal of the time L Y becomes higher than that of the signal of the time L the phase delaying unit delays a tracking time period. Conversely in such a case that the correlation of the signal of the time L Y becomes higher than that of the signal of the time L since the phase delaying unit leads the tracking time period the phases of the time integrated signals are adjusted in such a manner that these time integrated signals are synchronized with the transmission symbol rate.

However in the above described conventional synchronizing method the below mentioned problem is present. That is due to such a factor as a variation in communication distances and a variation in communication paths when pulse amplitudes and pulse widths pulse shapes are varied the pulse amplitudes can be hardly sampled at proper positions.

The present invention has been made of solving the conventional problem and therefore has an object to provide a wireless apparatus capable of correctly sampling waveforms of pulses even when shapes of the pulses are varied.

A wireless apparatus according to the present invention is featured by comprising a sampling unit for sampling an input signal in accordance with a plurality of different intervals from each other a variable delaying device for changing the plurality of sampling intervals a phase error calculating unit for calculating a phase error by employing an amplitude difference among a plurality of sampled values sampled by the sampling unit a synchronous status judging unit for judging a synchronous status by employing the phase error calculated by the phase error calculating unit and a delay amount control unit for changing a delay amount of the variable delaying device based upon both the phase error calculated by the phase error calculating unit and the synchronous status judged by the synchronous status judging unit.

In accordance with the above described arrangement since the sampling frequency can be increased in a quasi manner the waveform can be correctly predicted. As a consequence since the predicted waveform is employed the input signal may be synchronized with the clock signal and also while the maximum amplitude thereof may be predicted the transmission and reception operations may be controlled.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the sampling unit samples the input signal at first sampling timing and second sampling timing which are separated from each other in a predetermined interval and the delay amount control unit shifts at least one of the first and second sampling timing during a synchronous pull in operation and narrows the interval between the first and second sampling timing during a synchronous follow up operation.

In accordance with the above described arrangement even in such a case that the synchronous status is varied due to the variation in the pulse shapes since the sampling timing and the interval there between can be controlled in response to the synchronous statuses the pulse amplitudes can be sampled at the proper positions. In other words during the synchronous pull in operation at least one of the first sampling timing and the second sampling timing is shifted under such a condition that the sampling interval is wide so that probability at which the sampling point is hit on a portion of the pulse can be increased. Also during the synchronous follow up operation the sampling interval is narrowed and the sampling operation is carried out at such a point located in the vicinity of the synchronous point where the S N becomes high so that such an information that an adverse influence given to the amplitude due to the noise is decreased can be acquired.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the sampling unit is comprised of a first sampling unit for sampling the input signal at the first sampling timing and a second sampling unit for sampling the input signal at the second sampling timing and also the variable delaying device is comprised of a first variable delaying device for delaying a clock signal in response to a signal derived from the delay amount control unit so as to produce the first sampling timing and a second variable delaying device for delaying the first sampling timing in response to a signal derived from the delay amount control unit so as to produce the second sample timing.

In accordance with the above described arrangement the first and second variable delaying devices for producing the first and second sampling timing in response to the signal derived from the delay amount control unit are provided so that even when the pulse shape of the input signal is varied the pulse widths can be sampled at the proper positions.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the sampling unit samples the input signal at the first sampling timing and the second sampling timing separated from each other in the predetermined interval by thinning a sampling point.

In accordance with the above described arrangement a total number of the processing operations can be decreased by thinning the sampling point so that the process operation with respect to the input signal can be more quickly commenced and accomplished.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the phase error calculating unit calculates the phase error by detecting an amplitude difference between a first sampled value sampled by the first sampling unit and a second sampled value sampled by the second sampling unit and also the delay amount control unit changes the delay amounts of the first and second variable delaying devices based upon the phase error calculated by the phase error calculating unit and the synchronous status judged by the synchronous status judging unit.

In accordance with the above described arrangement the time of the clock signal is shifted based upon the detected phase error so as to perform the synchronous pull in operation so that the time duration for the synchronous pull in operation can be shortened. Also the sampling interval is changed in response to the detected synchronous status so that the synchronous jitter components produced during the follow up operation after the synchronous pull in operation can be reduced so as to advantageously stabilize the synchronization.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the phase error calculating unit calculates the phase error by detecting an amplitude difference between the first sampled value sampled at the first sampling timing and the second sampled value sampled at the second sampling timing and also the delay amount control unit changes at least any one of the first sampling timing and the second sampling timing based upon the phase error calculated by the phase error calculating unit and the synchronous status judged by the synchronous status judging unit.

In accordance with the above described arrangement the sampling timing is shifted based upon the detected phase error so that the time duration for the synchronous pull in operation can be shortened. Also the sampling interval is changed in response to the detected synchronous status so that the synchronous jitter component produced during the follow up operation after the synchronous pull in operation can be reduced so as to advantageously stabilize the synchronization.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the phase error calculating unit is comprised of a first table that is investigated so as to calculate the phase error.

In accordance with the above described arrangement the process operation for calculating the phase error can be carried out in a high speed by utilizing the first table.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the delay amount control unit is comprised of a third table that is investigated so as to determine the delay amount.

In accordance with the above described arrangement the process operation for determining the delay amount can be carried out in a high speed by utilizing the third table.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention while the delay amount control unit is comprised of a plurality of waveform tables corresponding to a waveform of the input signal the delay amount control unit predicts the waveform of the input signal so as to select a predetermined waveform table corresponding to the waveform of the input signal and refers to the selected waveform table so as to control the first sampling timing and the second sampling timing.

In accordance with the above described arrangement the waveform of the input signal is predicted so as to select the proper waveform table so that the sampling timing can be properly set in response to the waveform of the input signal so as to increase the synchronous precision. Alternatively the deformation of the waveform may be predicted by utilizing the known signal portion of the input signal and the waveform table may be changed based upon the predicted waveform deformation.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention during the synchronous follow up operation the delay amount control unit refers to the selected waveform table so as to narrow the interval between the first sample timing and the second sample timing.

In accordance with the above described arrangement the sampling interval is widened during the synchronous pull in operation. As a result the probability at which the sampling operation is performed at such a timing when the pulse is present can be increased. Also the sampling interval is narrowed during the synchronous follow up operation. As a result the waveforms of the pulse can be sampled which are located near the maximum value of the pulse so that the erroneous judgment caused by the noise can be avoided.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the delay amount control unit is comprised of a waveform predicting unit which defines the amplitude information acquired at the first and second sampling timing as a parameter of the prediction.

In accordance with the above described arrangement the waveform is predicted based upon the plurality of amplitude information acquired for the synchronization purpose so that the precision of the synchronization can be increased.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the waveform predicting unit is arranged by a waveform table storing unit for storing thereinto waveform information which has been previously prepared a waveform reproducing unit for reproducing a prediction purpose waveform based upon the amplitude information and temporal information of the input signal a correlation acquiring unit for acquiring a correlation between the waveform information stored in the waveform table storing unit and the waveform reproduced by the waveform reproducing unit and a waveform specifying unit for specifying a waveform based upon the correlative result obtained in the correlation acquiring unit so as to output table designation information for designating a table which is investigated in the delay amount control operation.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention while the delay amount control unit is comprised of a plurality of waveform tables corresponding to a waveform of the input signal the delay amount control unit predicts the waveform of the input signal so as to select a predetermined waveform table corresponding to the waveform of the input signal and refers to the selected waveform table so as to control the first sampling timing and the second sampling timing and the second sampling timing furthermore the delay amount control unit is comprised of a waveform predicting unit which defines the amplitude information acquired at the first and second sampling timing as a parameter of the prediction the waveform predicting unit is arranged by a waveform table storing unit for storing thereinto waveform information which has been previously prepared a waveform reproducing unit for reproducing a prediction purpose waveform based upon the amplitude information and temporal information of the input signal a correlation acquiring unit for acquiring a correlation between the waveform information stored in the waveform table storing unit and the waveform reproduced by the waveform reproducing unit and a waveform specifying unit for specifying a waveform based upon the correlative result obtained in the correlation acquiring unit so as to output table designation information for designating a table which is investigated in the delay amount control operation and also the temporal information of the input signal is a delay amount when the clock signal is delayed by the first and second variable delaying devices.

In accordance with the above described arrangement the absolute time is not required and the waveform can be predicted based upon the relative time.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the waveform specifying unit changes a table to be selected in response to a sequence of the input signal.

In accordance with the above described arrangement in such a case that an input signal corresponds to such a specific sequence data stream by which it can be grasped that a phase thereof has been previously shifted the shift can be corrected.

Also the wireless apparatus related to the present invention is further comprised of reception power calculating unit for calculating reception power based upon the output result of the phase error calculating unit.

In accordance with the above described arrangement a magnitude of an input signal can be calculated based upon the calculation result of the phase error. For instance the phase error calculation result may be utilized as information as to an AGC Automatic Gain Control and the like.

Also in the wireless apparatus related to the present invention the phase error calculating unit calculates the phase error based upon the first sampled values and the second sampled values which have been sampled predetermined times and the synchronous status judging unit judges the synchronous status every time the phase error calculating unit calculates the phase error.

In accordance with the present invention after the sampled values have been measured plural times the collected sampled value is employed in order to judge the synchronous status. As a result a total judging time can be reduced as compared with such judging times that every time the sampled value is measured the phase error is calculated so as to judge the synchronous status.

In accordance with the present invention even in such a case that the synchronous status is varied due to the variation of the pulse shapes the sampling timing and the time intervals thereof can be controlled in response to the synchronous status the pulse amplitudes can be sampled at the proper positions.

As disclosed in this example an interval t between the sampling points and during the synchronous pull in operation is made wide so that probability at which a sampling point is sampled at not such a timing between pulse and pulse that a pulse is not present but at such a timing that the pulse is present can be increased. Also under the synchronous holding condition another interval t is made narrow and is changed in such a manner that a sampling operation is carried out at a large amplitude and also is controlled in order to avoid an erroneous judgment caused by noise. As a result the synchronizing operation can be carried out within a short time and at the same time the synchronizing operation can be carried out in high precision.

Referring now to a description is made of a structural example of the synchronizing apparatus that performs this control operation. An input signal is sampled by sampling unit and at respective timing and then respective sampled values are inputted to a phase error calculating unit .

In the phase error calculating unit a phase error is calculated based upon the value sampled by the sampling unit and the value sampled by the sampling unit and then the calculated phase error amount is outputted to a synchronous status judging unit and a delay amount control unit . The synchronous status judging unit judges whether or not a synchronization is established and then outputs the judged synchronous status to the delay amount control unit .

The delay amount control unit controls to increase and or decrease delay amounts which have been presently set to variable delaying devices and based upon the phase error amount outputted from the phase error calculating unit and the synchronous status outputted from the synchronous status judging unit .

The variable delaying devices and delay a clock signal in accordance with the delay amounts set by the delay amount control unit . The sampling unit and sample the input signal based upon the clocks whose timing has been adjusted by the variable delaying devices and .

It should be understood that when there is substantially no difference between the sampled value and the sampled value the sampling timing is coincident with the input signal . Also if the sampled value is smaller than the sampled value then the sampling timing retards with respect to the input signal . Furthermore if the sampled value is larger than the sampled value then the sampling timing leads with respect to the input signal .

In such a case that the input signal is synchronized with the sampling timing in a of the sampled value becomes substantially equal to the sampled value irrespective of delay amounts t t made by the variable delaying devices .

In such a case that the sampling timing retards with respect to the input signal in b of and c of when a delay amount made by the variable delaying device is larger t t than another delay amount a difference between the sampled value and the sampled value becomes large. Since the difference between the sampled values becomes large with respect to the error of the sampling timing even when the error of the sampling timing is small the error of the sampling timing can be easily calculated and the synchronous status can be easily judged. In other words in such a case that the error of the sampling timing is small since the difference of the sampling timing itself is small there are some possibilities that the large small relationship is erroneously judged. To the contrary since the difference between the sampled value and the sampled value is large if such sampled values whose difference is large are employed then the large small relationship can be hardly judged in an erroneous manner and also the leading retarding statuses with respect to the synchronous position can be readily judged.

Also since the difference between the sample values is large such a possibility can be lowered that with respect to a waveform disturbance of the input signal which is caused by noise and the like the error contained in the sampling timing is calculated and the synchronous status is erroneously judged for the input signal . As a consequence it is possible to avoid an execution of such a control operation that if the error of the sample timing is erroneously calculated then the sampling error is increased.

Since such a possibility can be lowered that the error of the sample timing is erroneously calculated and the synchronous status is erroneously judged the below mentioned possibility may be increased namely such a control operation for decreasing the error of the sample timing may be carried out during initial synchronization when synchronous pull in operation is carried out . As a result the synchronization can be established within a short time.

As represented in although the above described description has been exemplified by employing the plurality of sampling unit and only one sampling unit may be alternatively employed. As shown in even when the below mentioned sampling operation is provided a similar effect may be achieved. That is while a single pulse may be sampled at a plurality of sampling points and further skipping sample timing sampling operation is not performed or sampled data is not employed in judgment may be prepared a portion t where an interval between sampling points is wide may be provided and another portion t where an interval between sampling points is narrow may be provided.

Also in the description has been made of such a case that the plurality of sampling points are present with respect to the single pulse. Alternatively in such a case that sampling operations for all of pulses are not required which are executed in a synchronous pull in operation and a follow up operation an under sampling operation may be similarly carried out in which the sampling operation is carried out over a plurality of pulses.

Also as represented in the above described operations have been described only in such a case that leading and retarding of the phases are judged so as to change the sampling timing every time the measuring operation is carried out. Alternatively leading and retarding of the phases may be judged after the measuring operations thereof have been performed predetermined times. In other words for instance as shown in sampling points to of measuring operations may be firstly carried out at a large number of sampling points and thereafter a judging process operation may be carried out with respect to the collected measured values. In it is so judged that sampled values at the sampling points and are larger than sampled values of other sampling points. Then since the sampling points and are compared with a pulse repetition period it is possible to grasp that the sampling points and are sampling points with respect to the same phase for the pulse. As a result this point is judged as the synchronous timing.

In the embodiment mode 1 such a process operation has been carried out in which the intervals t t during which two sets of the sampling unit and perform the sampling operations are changed in response to the synchronous status. In contrast to this process operation in an embodiment mode 2 synchronous control operations based upon sampling results are formed in tables so as to perform a high speed process operation.

As previously described the different tables can be utilized in response to the synchronous statuses. As delay amount control tables indicated in for example plural sorts of tables may be employed for instance a pull in judgment table a table during pull in operation a table after pull in operation and the like may be employed. A selection of the delay amount control tables is performed by a table selector . Alternatively a judgment result table selecting information of a waveform table represented in the drawing may be employed as a parameter for selecting a delay amount control purpose table.

Also a phase error calculating unit may alternatively contain a reference table in order to calculate a phase error. Also a synchronous status judging unit may contain a reference table for judging a synchronous status. As previously described since the phase error calculating unit calculates the phase error and the synchronous status judging unit judges the synchronous status with reference to the tables the respective process operations can be carried out in high speeds.

Referring to a description is made of the reason why the waveform table is employed. In the previous descriptions the intervals between the sampling points have been set based upon the difference between the amplitude values of the two sampling points sampling points and and the synchronous status. However as indicated in even when amplitude differences between the sampling point and the sampling point are equal to each other the below mentioned technical point has not been considered. That is which waveform portions have been sampled with respect to a maximum amplitude of a waveform.

For example if a waveform indicated by a dot line is sampled at sampling points denoted by black circles then the waveform portions located in the vicinity of an intermediate portion of a maximum amplitude thereof are sampled. However if a received waveform corresponds to another waveform indicated by a solid line then sampling points constitute sampling points indicated by white circles. In other words since this sampling operation implies that higher amplitude portions are acquired with respect to the maximum amplitude in order to sample the waveform portions located similar to the above described intermediate waveform portions an interval therebetween must be widened to constitute sampling points indicated by an oblique line.

In other words delay amounts set based upon waveforms are different from each other so that different tables must be investigated. As a consequence since first sampling information of the ND converter second sampling information of the ND converter and the delay amount control information of the delay amount control table are inputted to the waveform table a waveform is predicted and the predicted waveform is employed in order to select a proper table.

Since correlations with respect to the waveform information stored in this waveform table storing unit are acquired by a correlator such a waveform having the highest correlation stored in the waveform table storing unit is extracted so as to predict a waveform of a pulse under reception. The waveform is specified by comparing the correlations with each other by a waveform specifying unit . The waveform information acquired in this operation is employed so as to select a delay amount control table. Since the above described arrangement is made such a synchronizing apparatus capable of establishing a synchronization within a short time can be realized with employment of a simple arrangement.

More specifically after the synchronous status has been judged a waveform under synchronous status is predicted based upon the amplitude information of the sampling points and and the delay amount control information which have been acquired during the synchronous pull in operation and as shown in a sampling interval is narrowed from t to t by controlling the delay amounts to the variable delaying devices and so that synchronous jitter components can be suppressed to become a small component.

It should also be understood that no description has been made of a sampling number employed in the above described waveform predicting operation. Alternatively even when all of the sampling numbers may be employed or 3 or more pieces of sampling numbers may be employed the waveform may be predicted. Otherwise the waveform may be predicted based upon an inclination of a waveform by employing two sampling points.

Also a difference between a present sampling position and a sampling point at a synchronous point may be alternatively detected from predicted waveform information so as to change the delay amount adjusting amount of the variable delaying device which controls the delay amount of the reference signal clock. As a changing method if a shift between a present sampling point and the synchronous point is large then the adjusting amount may be increased whereas if a shift between a present sampling point and the synchronous point is small then the adjusting amount may be decreased. As a consequence when the above described shift is large this shift may be controlled in a coarse manner in order that the delay amount adjusting amount is quickly approximated to the optimum synchronous point and thereafter when the shift becomes small the delay amount adjusting point is controlled in a fine manner so that the synchronous jitter components may be suppressed to a small value.

Alternatively similar to the delay amount adjusting amount a difference between a present sampling position and a sampling point at a synchronous point may be alternatively detected from predicted waveform information so as to change the delay amount adjusting amount of the variable delaying device and also to change a total number of pulses for controlling the variable delay amount namely the averaging number.

As the changing methods if a shift between a present sampling point and the synchronous point is large then the averaging number may be decreased whereas if a shift between a present sampling point and the synchronous point is small then the averaging number may be increased. As a consequence when the above described shift is large this shift may be controlled in a coarse manner in order that the delay amount adjusting amount is quickly approximated to the optimum synchronous point and thereafter when the shift becomes small the delay amount adjusting point is controlled in a fine manner so that the synchronous jitter components may be suppressed to a small value.

Also in the above described explanation only such an operation has been described that the synchronous timing is coincident by employing the sampled amplitude values. Alternatively a waveform may be predicted based upon a plurality of sampled values in accordance with the above explained method so as to predict a maximum amplitude of a reception signal and thus the predicted maximum amplitude may be employed in transmission and reception control operations. As the transmission and reception control operations a gain control AGC control operation of a reception amplifier a transmission signal power control operation and the like may be conceived.

Further in the above explained descriptions no description has been made as to when the reference tables are set. For instance the reference tables may be set at a factory shipping stage or may be alternatively set in response to a sequence to be received. Also a deformation of a waveform may be alternatively predicted by utilizing the known portion of the reception signal and then the reference tables may be alternatively changed based upon the predicted waveform deformation.

Although the present invention has been described in detail or with reference to the specific embodiment modes it is obvious for ordinarily skilled engineers to conceive such a fact that the present invention can be modified and changed in various manners without departing from the technical scope and spirit of the present invention.

The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent application JP A 2006 335737 filed on Dec. 13 2006 and Japanese Patent application JP A 2007 245829 filed on Sep. 21 2007 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference into this application.

The present invention has an advantage capable of providing the wireless apparatus such as the synchronizing apparatus in which even when the synchronous status is varied due to the variation in the pulse shapes both the sampling timing and the interval therebetween can be controlled in response to the synchronous statuses so that the pulse widths can be sampled at the proper positions and the signal variable delaying unit is controlled based upon the information acquired from the data sampling unit with respect to the inputted signal so as to synchronize the sampling timing with each other.
