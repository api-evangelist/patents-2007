The embodiments described herein may be manufactured used and or licensed by or for the United States Government.

The embodiments herein generally relate to microelectronic systems and more particularly to radio frequency RF microelectromechanical systems MEMS switches.

RF MEMS switches have recently received considerable attention. Generally desirable for their extremely low insertion loss extreme linearity minimal intermodulation product generation and power consumption characteristics RF MEMS switches posses many advantages over their competing technologies. RF MEMS switches fall into two basic categories series shunt RF configurations and ohmic capacitive contact behaviors. RF MEMS series switches have been demonstrated with both ohmic and capacitive contacts.

However the majority of RF MEMS shunt switches have been configured with capacitive contact architectures. Many successful switches of this kind have been demonstrated over the years but generally all inherently suffer from inadequate performance below X band 

DC contact or ohmic. RF MEMS shunt switches have also been demonstrated. These switches utilize a free hinge constrained contact beam with separate actuation pads. However physical contact still occurs between the actuation electrodes and the contact beam an undesirable trait with respect to switch lifetime. The inductance of such a design also tends to hamper the high frequency operation of the switch. Moreover the lack of rigid mechanical constraints within the hinge region tends to make this design exceedingly susceptible to performance degradation due to vibration or even simple rigid body motion of the parent system and limits its attainable switching speed. The lack of rigid mechanical constraints within the hinge region also in all likelihood results in significant device to device performance variability. All of these factors tend to limit the operational lifetime of the switch as well as its usefulness in military applications.

Other designs use a DC contact RF MEMS shunt switch that utilizes a suspended RF center conductor contact beam. Bias electrodes are placed directly beneath this structure to enable maximum with respect to geometric considerations of load application only actuation force unit voltage. This design prevents direct physical contact between the actuation electrodes and the contact beam. However to attain this feature with the suspended RF center conductor contact beam design the actuation electrodes must be present in the co planar waveguide CPW gaps. This leads to significant degradation in the return loss of the switch particularly at higher frequencies. The presence of this metal in the CPW gaps prevents proper impedance matching over a large range of frequencies and contributes to low return loss. Accordingly there remains a need for a new electrostatic ohmic shunt RF MEMS switch that achieves an improved insertion loss performance over conventional switches.

These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the following descriptions while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.

The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.

As mentioned there remains a need for a new electrostatic ohmic shunt RF MEMS switch that achieves an improved insertion loss performance over conventional switches. The embodiments herein achieve this by providing an electrostatic ohmic shunt RF MEMS switch that has an extremely low nearly immeasurable insertion loss and which has a greatly increased device lifetime compared with conventional switches. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures there are shown preferred embodiments.

The components of the switch are described with more specificity below. The CPW transmission line comprises two ground planes flanking the center RF conductor . The CPW transmission line is the path along which RF signals propagate. Preferably it comprises common transmission line geometry and the RF line narrows narrowed section beneath the location of the contact beam to compensate for excess capacitance of the contact beam which reduces the return and insertion loss of the switch by impedance matching the switch to transmission line characteristic impedance. Preferably the CPW transmission line comprises pure electron beam evaporated gold with a thin titanium adhesion layer. Beneath the CPW transmission line may be a thin layer of silicon dioxide that mitigates bias voltage dependence of the RF performance of the transmission line. This is referred to as the dielectric underlayer . Next the CPW transmission line comprises ground straps which tie the adjacent sections of the ground planes around the bias pads to minimize the impact of the ground plane geometric discontinuity on the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.

The bias pads are electrodes for applying voltage to generate the electrostatic actuation forces. Traditional RF MEMS shunt switches apply the actuation voltage between the ground planes and the center RF conductor. However this traditional configuration is viable for capacitive switching but not for ohmic or metal to metal contacts. The contacts would simply weld together given the low contact resistance and the relatively large voltages applied between them. Accordingly the switch provided by the embodiments herein provides a separate electrode with which to apply that voltage eliminating the large voltages across the metal to metal contacts. This feature allows for an electrostatic ohmic shunt RF MEMS switch in accordance with the embodiments herein. A structural beam referred to as the bias line air bridge connects the bias lines that are connected to the bias pads located within each ground plane . The bias line air bridge allows for a single bias line to actuate sides of the contact beam on either side of the center RF conductor and thus simplifies the biasing scheme especially for larger circuits of which the switch may be a component. Preferably platinum is used as the bias pad material with a titanium adhesion under layer. Furthermore in another embodiment one may use a dielectric for example shown in over the bias pads to reduce the probability of shorting between the contact beam and the bias pads . In another embodiment a resistive material such as NiCr could be used to form the bias lines so as to provide resistive isolation of the bias line from the RF current flowing on the contact beam .

The mechanical ground stops comprise those portions of the ground planes beneath the contact beam which prevent the contact beam from touching the bias pads . One of the primary failure mechanisms with traditional capacitive RF MEMS switches is the build up of charging of the dielectrics used between the contacts. The build up of electric charges creates an electric field between the dielectric material and the mechanical contact beam. These fields can become large enough to permanently close open the switch contacts. In order to overcome this the switch provided by the embodiments herein mitigates the charging effect by preventing the physical contact between the contact beam and the bias pads this reduces the fields within the dielectric thus mitigating the charging phenomenon. In another embodiment the switch does not include any dielectric material at all thereby totally eliminating this failure mechanism altogether.

The contact dimples referred to as the ground plane dimples are located on the mechanical ground stops closest to adjacent to the narrowed section of the center RF conductor . These electrical contacts ground plane dimples are preferably thinner in height than the contacts RF dimples on the center RE conductor to ensure that the contact occurs on both sets of dimples . The ground plane dimples shorten the effective length of the contact beam and thus greatly reduce the imposed inductance of the contact beam . Reducing the induced inductance of the contact beam greatly improves the high frequency performance of the switch . The ground plane dimples may comprise platinum with a thin layer of titanium or gold used for adhesion.

The contact beam is preferably embodied as a conductive clamped clamped structure positioned with its major longitudinal axis perpendicular to the major axis of CPW transmission line ground planes and center RF conductor . Moreover the contact beam is elevated above the bias pads and the mechanical ground stops . As described above actuation of the contact beam occurs when the snap in voltage is applied between the contact beam and the bias pads . When the contact beam makes contact with the contacts RF dimples located on the narrowed section of the center RF conductor of the CPW transmission line and the ground plane dimples the RE signal propagating along the line is shunted to the ground planes thus turning the signal off . Furthermore pure gold may used as the material for the contact beam .

Each of the contact dimples ground plane dimples and RF dimples are embodied as small circular features either on the ground planes or on the center RF conductor and in both cases the dimples are located beneath the contact beam . The dimples provide the specific location of contact whereby a smaller contact area increases contact pressure and consequently lowers the contact resistance of the switch . The lower contact resistance thereby increases the isolation of the switch in the closed state. In one embodiment platinum is used as the material of the dimples with a thin titanium or gold layer used for adhesion.

According to an embodiment herein the switch may be arranged according to the following approximate configurations. The CPW transmission line preferably includes three parallel conductors two ground planes and center RF conductor with a gap between the center RF conductor and the outer ground planes . The gap and the width of the center RF conductor primarily dictate the characteristic impedance approximately 50 Ohms in one embodiment of the transmission line. There are regions within the ground planes that are open for the bias pads and bias lines . The mechanical ground stops preferably extend between adjacent bias pads . The center RF conductor beneath the contact beam i.e. the narrowed section of the center RF conductor narrows to compensate for the additional capacitance provided by the overhanging contact beam . Furthermore the ground straps link the mechanical ground stops to the adjacent sections of the ground planes . The thickness of the CPW components preferably exceed the sum thicknesses of the bias pads any passivating dielectric for example shown in present on the bias pads and the minimum air gap at switch closure between the top of the bias pad and the bottom of the contact beam . This minimum air gap is determined by the actuation voltage and the breakdown strength of air within that gap. If the gap is below the minimum value then electrical breakdown of the air or direct shorting of the bias pads and contact beam in the dielectric less bias pad case can occur. The width of the center RF conductor is preferably approximately 50 microns and the gap between the center RF conductor and the ground planes is approximately 30 microns. The thickness of the CPW transmission line ground planes and center RF conductor is preferably 0.75 microns. The thickness of the silicon dioxide layer beneath the CPW transmission line is preferably between 0.2 and 0.5 microns. These dimensions for the materials and thicknesses involved results in a 50 Ohm characteristic impendence of the transmission line.

The bias pads and bias lines which are located in the slots in the ground planes are preferably embodied as rectangular pads and traces respectively. Preferably the bias lines and bias pads are thinner in height than the surrounding ground planes . This ensures that when the contact beam closes it does not make physical contact with the bias pads . This allows for bias pads without dielectric material. As mentioned above this avoids the common failure mechanism with traditional electrostatic RF MEMS devices charging of the dielectric that can result in actuation failure. However even if the bias pads comprised a dielectric layer the aforementioned air gap mitigates the probability of stiction between the contact beam and the bias pads an advantage afforded by the switch compared with traditional switches.

The bias line air bridge preferably anchors to the bias lines within the ground planes and is elevated above the inner mechanical ground stops the gap and the center RF conductor . The bias lines can be passivated with a dielectric to mitigate electrical breakdown between the bias lines and bias pads and ground planes . The dielectric covers the bias lines and bias pads and extends beyond the edges of the bias pads and bias lines to the edge of the surrounding ground plane and is patterned with an opening over the anchor region of the bias line air bridge . This opening allows for electrical contact between the bias lines and the bias line air bridge . The gap between the bias lines and the surrounding ground plane depends upon a number of factors but generally a minimum distance exists that is defined by the electrical breakdown of this gap . The minimum distance is preferably approximately 15 microns. The thickness of the bias lines and bias pads is preferably approximately 0.3 microns and the thickness of the passivating dielectric for example shown in is preferably between approximately 0.1 and 0.2 microns.

The mechanical ground stops are preferably rectangular sections of the ground planes that extend between the bias pads . The ground plane dimples are preferably circular features and are preferably less than approximately 10 microns in diameter and approximately 0.1 microns in thickness and are located on the mechanical ground stops that are directly adjacent to the narrowed section of the center RF conductor . The number of bias pads and thus the number of mechanical ground stops is primarily determined by the minimum distance between the mechanical ground stops that ensures that the contact beam does not locally collapse onto the bias pads . Once the contact beam has closed and is in mechanical contact with the mechanical ground stops the section of the contact beam between any two contacted mechanical ground stops has the potential to collapse onto the bias pad . The behavior of this section is generally determined by the minimum closed switch air gap between the contact beam and the bias pad the actuation voltage the distance between the contacted mechanical ground stops and the material spring constant of the contact beam . For a given set of these parameters the shorter the distance between the contacted stops becomes the more likely that the contact beam will not collapse upon the bias pad . There is a minimum distance at which this occurs and this minimum distance then dictates the number of bias pads and mechanical ground stops . Preferably it is desirable to minimize the number of bias pads and mechanical ground stops as this tends to decrease the total bias pad electrode area.

The contact beam is preferably a rectangular beam with an array of etch holes configured within it. The etch holes facilitate the release of the contact beam from the sacrificial layers of . The etch holes preferably range in size from approximately 5 10 microns. The contact beam is anchored to the ground planes and is perpendicular to the CPW transmission line as described above. Moreover the contact beam is elevated above the bias pads mechanical ground stops and the narrowed section of the center RF conductor . The anchored regions of the contact beam where it is anchored to the ground planes are preferably rounded to both minimize stress concentration at the location as well as to ensure a consistent thickness of the contact beam near the anchor . The rounding is achieved by controlling the underlying sacrificial layer FIG. A profile as well as through control of the metal deposition. The contact beam preferably comprises electron beam evaporated pure gold whereby evaporated deposition tends to deposit material with a high degree of directionality. Thus the deposited material tends to mimic the underlying topography on which it is being deposited. Without the curvature of the underlying topography the evaporated material thins significantly near any 90 steps in the topography. This results in undesirable mechanical behavior of the contact beam when the anchors display this thinning. Preferably the contact beam is approximately 500 microns or less in length approximately 100 microns or less in width and approximately between 1 3 microns in thickness.

The contact dimples are preferably approximately five microns in diameter or less. The height of the RF dimples preferably exceed the height of the ground plane dimples to ensure that during mechanical switch closure both sets of contact dimples are closed. The preferable height of the RF dimples is approximately 0.5 microns.

The fabrication of the switch is shown in the successive fabrication steps of with the thicknesses given below being approximate thicknesses. As shown in the top down view of and the profile view of the starting material of the switch of is the substrate which comprises a single crystal silicon wafer with a resistivity greater than 10 kOhm cm for reasonable high frequency performance. Other possible substrates include sapphire Z cut quartz gallium arsenide as well as others. Next as shown in the top down view of and the profile view of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD of SiO20 approximately 2 000 5 000 occurs in an approximately 700 C. Natmosphere at an approximate annealing time of 60 seconds.

After this as shown in the top down view of the dashed line in indicates the cross sectional views illustrated in all subsequent profile views and the profile view of a liftoff process occurs with evaporated Ti Au 30 approximately 200 7 300 to define the CPW transmission line ground planes and center RF conductor . As shown in the top down view of and the profile view of a liftoff process occurs with evaporated Ti Au Pt approximately 200 1 800 1 000 to define the bias pads and bias lines of . Thereafter as shown in the top down view of and the profile view of a liftoff process occurs with evaporated Au Pt approximately 4 000 1 000 to define the RF dimples .

Next as shown in the top down view of and the profile view of PECVD of SiN SiO34 approximately 500 1 000 occurs followed by a reactive ion etch RIE patterning process of the SiN SiO34. After this as shown in the top down view of and the profile view of a liftoff process occurs with evaporated Au Pt or Ti Pt approximately 200 800 to define the ground plane dimples .

The remaining processing steps are subject to two different process sequences. The first process is shown sequentially in and utilizes ion milling of a conformal gold layer to pattern the contact beam . The second process is shown sequentially in and utilizes a liftoff step for the patterning of the contact beam . Both embodiments are valid however the liftoff process has certain advantages. In particular the liftoff process generally results in a substantially cleaner process beneficial to reliability and process yield .

As shown in the top down view of and the profile view of the deposition of electron beam evaporated pure Au 38 approximately 10 000 30 000 occurs followed by a liftoff process to define the contact beam ground straps and bias line air bridge preferably utilizing acetone as the removal agent. This ensures that the UV hardened photoresist remains while the photoresist not shown utilized for the liftoff procedure is completely removed. The contact beam ground straps and bias line air bridge are therefore not released from the wafer surface substrate and not subject to stiction. The switch is released as shown in the top down view of and the profile view of when the UV hardened sacrificial photoresist layer is removed in an oxygen plasma ash process.

The miniaturization thus far of RF circuits has been exploited by the cellular phone and wireless products markets. Military communications and radar systems also benefit from the further miniaturization of RF circuits. Accordingly the high performance RF MEMS switch provided by the embodiments herein enable low loss and low cost RF phase shifters for Electronic Scanning Antenna ESA applications reconfigurable antenna RF seekers ground based radars and millimeter wave MMW sensor components.

The electrostatic ohmic shunt RF MEMS switch provides for an extremely low nearly immeasurable insertion loss and allows for a greatly increased device lifetime because no contact occurs between the bias pads and the contact beam and because of the ability for eliminating the dielectric on the bias pads altogether. Moreover the switch mitigates and potentially eliminates the primary failure mechanism associated with traditional capacitive electrostatic shunt switches. The electrostatic isolation of the switch at DC is comparable to isolation at 40 GHz. This kind of performance is extremely uncommon in MEMS switches. Furthermore the switch may be ideally suited for high frequency operation W band 75 111 GHz .
