Currently there are a number of systems for performing laser detection and ranging LADAR . Typically the photocurrent from the detector of a LADAR system is amplified with a high gain amplifier because the power of the received light signal and the resulting output current of the LADAR receiver is relatively small e.g. sub nanoamp currents . The use of high gain amplifiers however may be problematic because of resulting noise. For instance in a LADAR system the noise resulting from the high gain amplifier may limit the sensitivity of the LADAR receiver.

One existing solution for overcoming amplifier noise is to use a high gain detector such as an avalanche photodiode APD . APDs however may also introduce excess noise into the LADAR system. When modulating the APD gain to produce photonic mixing as required for the chirped amplitude modulation AM LADAR technique the modulated excess noise may produce large amounts of self clutter. Some chirped AM LADAR systems have reduced this problem by using metal semiconductor metal MSM photonic mixing detectors. Such systems have been effective for 3 D imagery and have improved the self clutter problem but with only near unity gain so that the receiver is amplifier noise limited.

Some pulsed time of flight LADAR systems employ photon counting detectors such as high gain photomultiplier tubes PMT high gain microchannel plate MCP based image intensifier tubes intensified photodiodes IPD or Geiger mode APDs to overcome the excess APD noise and amplifier noise. For example when operated with a reverse bias voltage above the breakdown voltage a Geiger mode APD outputs a large pulse upon single carrier excitation e.g. single photon detection or dark noise carrier excitation . Typical gains in these types of LADAR receivers for example are more satisfactory. However there is the additional problem that the output pulse voltage current level is not related to the received optical power level in Geiger mode operation. Since range information is carried on the modulation of the optical power level in chirped AM LADARs photon counting detectors have not previously been used as detectors for chirped AM LADARs.

This disclosure relates to various embodiments of photon counting chirped AM laser detection and ranging LADAR systems and related methods. Several embodiments are described below with reference to .

In general an exemplary embodiment of a LADAR system operates by modulating the intensity power of a light signal with a chirped waveform with a known time dependent frequency variation and transmitting the modulated light signal toward a target. A portion of the transmitted laser intensity may be reflected from the target back toward the LADAR system and received by a photon counting sensor. The received light signal which contains the original transmitted laser intensity modulation is delayed in time due to travel along the path from the transmitter to the target and back to the receiver.

The LADAR system measures various target attributes e.g. range reflectance velocity etc. using the received light signal. As mentioned above the modulation on the received light signal reflected from the target is a delayed version of the modulation of the transmitted signal. In order to extract ranging information from the received light signal the LADAR system determines an intermediate frequency IF waveform i.e. offset frequency beat frequency or difference frequency . As used herein an intermediate frequency is a difference frequency produced by the multiplicative mixing of the transmitted light s modulation waveform with the received light s modulation waveform because the transmitted light s modulation waveform is at a different frequency than that of the received light s modulation waveform at any given instant due to the round trip delay time to the target and back and or due to the target s line of sight velocity.

It is well known that the intensity of light is proportional to the mean arrival rate of the photons at a detector comprising the light. Therefore modulation of the light intensity correspondingly modulates the mean arrival rate of the photons comprising the light. Herein we refer to a stream of photons with a time varying mean arrival rate proportional to a time varying intensity modulation waveform as a temporally modulated photon stream The chirped AM LADAR system determines the intermediate frequency by mixing the temporally modulated photon stream corresponding to the received light signal with the modulation from waveform that was applied to the original transmitted light signal. As mentioned above the transmitted light signal s intensity power is modulated with a waveform having a known frequency variation with time. For example the power of the transmitted light signal may be modulated with a sinusoidal waveform having a frequency that is linearly swept over a defined bandwidth. Therefore the mean temporal density of photon arrivals at the receiver follows this modulation. In order to detect the intermediate frequency due to the round trip delay time between the LADAR system and the target between the modulation of the received photon arrival rate and the waveform used to modulate the transmitted signal the two signals are mixed together by applying a gating i.e. on off voltage waveform which is synchronous with the waveform used to modulate the transmitted signal to the bias voltage of the photon counting sensor.

The mixing of the transmitted modulation waveform with the sinusoidal temporal density of photon arrivals via the gating action synchronous with due to the transmitted modulation waveform of the photon counting sensor produces a sinusoidal modulation of the temporal density of signal photo electrons at the intermediate frequency between the two signals.

An embodiment of a photon counting chirped AM LADAR system will now be described with reference to . As illustrated in LADAR system transmits a light signal arrow toward a target and receives a portion arrow of the light signal reflected from the target. In general LADAR system comprises a waveform generator e.g. sinusoidal chirp generator a laser transmission optics reception optics and a photon counting sensor . The waveform generator produces a signal to be used as the laser modulation and the local oscillator gating signal for photon counting sensor . For example in some embodiments the waveform generator comprises a sinusoidal chirp generator that produces a chirped signal with a frequency that increases linearly as a function of time over a period of time T. The chirped signal is provided to a wideband RF power amplifier via connection . The amplified signal is provided to a laser via connection . In some embodiments a LADAR system may include a matching circuit that matches the driving impedance of amplifier to the impedance of laser .

Laser converts the chirped signal into a light waveform with power proportional to the driving current. The divergent laser light beam emitted by laser is collected by transmission optics collimated and directed toward a target as indicated by arrow . The portion of transmitted light that is reflected by the target and propagated back arrow to LADAR system is collected by reception optics and focused onto the active detection region of photon counting sensor . As illustrated in some embodiments of LADAR system can include optional optical elements such as a solar filter .

Photon counting sensor comprises a single photon counting sensor array although in other embodiments various other numbers and types of photon counting sensors may be used. For example any of the following or other types of photon counting sensors may be used a Geiger mode avalanche photodiode s APD high gain photomultiplier tube s PMT high gain microchannel plate MCP based image intensifier tube s intensified photodiode s IPD .

Referring to the embodiment in when switched on i.e. gated on the photon counting sensor converts an incident photon into a large current or voltage pulse. The mean arrival time of the photons and therefore of the photon counting sensor s output current voltage pulses when gated on is proportional to the incident light s power.

As described in more detail below photon counting sensor is switched on off i.e. gated on off . via a signal received from chirp generator via connections and . The gating of the photon counting sensor by the chirp signal from chirp generator via connections and effectively multiplies the stream of photons detected by photon counting sensor by a rectangular waveform version of the chirp waveform. Since the mean arrival rate of the stream of photons is modulated with a delayed version of the modulation waveform applied to the power of the transmitted light the modulation of the photon stream s mean arrival rate is at the frequency that the chirp modulation waveform had when the light was emitted. This frequency differs from that of the chirp waveform applied to gate the photon counting sensor at the time of the arrival of the photons at the photon counting sensor due to the round trip delay time to and from the target. Therefore the product of this multiplication process also known as mixing process contains a signal oscillating at a frequency called the intermediate frequency that is the difference between the frequency of the gating chirped waveform and the photon mean arrival rate modulation chirped waveform. The product of this mixing process also contains a signal oscillating at a frequency corresponding to the sum of the frequency of the gating chirped waveform and the photon mean arrival rate modulation chirped waveform. This sum frequency signal is eliminated by low pass filter .

Output current voltage from photon counting sensor is provided to an amplifier via connection . Amplifier converts the sequence of output current voltage pulses into a sequence of high amplitude voltage pulses.

Various numbers and types of amplifiers can be used. For example in some embodiments a wideband trans impedance amplifier can be used. The amplified voltage waveform pulses may be provided to hard limiter . The output of hard limiter is provided to lowpass filter to pass the intermediate frequency signal while blocking the sum frequency signal sequence of output current voltage pulses into a sequence of high amplitude voltage pulses.

The intermediate frequency signal is converted into digital form via an A D converter digital input and further processed via processor . In this regard LADAR system includes memory which contains various hardware firmware and or software for controlling the processing of the digitized intermediate frequency signal.

It should be noted that the output waveform of photon counting sensor may be processed in a variety of ways. Therefore in alternative embodiments of LADAR system additional components may be present. Furthermore some components illustrated in may be substituted for others and or removed from LADAR system .

Having described the general components of LADAR system of the operation and or control of photon counting sensor will be described in more detail. As mentioned above LADAR system determines the intermediate frequency by mixing the temporally modulated photon stream arrow with the original transmitted light signal arrow . The light signal transmitted by laser is modulated with the waveform produced by chirp generator e.g. a sinusoidal waveform having a frequency that is linearly swept over a wide bandwidth . The temporal density of photon arrivals at reception optics therefore follows this modulation. In order to detect the intermediate frequency due to the round trip delay time between the LADAR system and the target between the modulation of the received photon arrival rate and the waveform used to modulate the transmitted signal the two signals are mixed together.

The intermediate frequency between the transmitted waveform and the received signal may be determined by gating e.g. turning on off photon counting sensor relative to the modulation waveform of the chirp waveform produced by chirp generator . In some embodiments photon counting sensor is gated on and off by a rectangular voltage waveform having a frequency synchronized to the chirped sinusoidal amplitude modulation of the signal produced by chirp generator . As illustrated in the embodiment of a rectangular local oscillator LO waveform is obtained by passing a portion of the chirp waveform from chirp generator to a hard limiter via connection . The resulting waveform is provided to an amplifier via connection . The amplified waveform is provided to photon counting sensor via connection .

The gating voltage waveform functions as a radio frequency RF local oscillator LO and the gating of photon counting sensor by this waveform provides the mixing of the RF LO with the temporal density of photon arrivals. As an example illustrates a simulation graph of the transmitter chirped sinusoid waveform the chirped rectangular waveform and Poisson distributed photon events as functions of time. This LO voltage waveform may be used to gate a variety of photon counting sensors such as Geiger mode APDs high gain MCP image intensifier tubes IPDs and PMTs.

The mixing of the chirped rectangular RF LO with the chirped sinusoidal temporal density of photon arrivals via the gating action of the LO waveform on photon counting sensor produces a sinusoidal modulation of the temporal density of signal photo electrons at the difference frequency i.e. intermediate frequency IF between the RF LO and the received signal. In this regard illustrates a simulation graph of the Poisson distributed single photo electron events of produced by the RF LO mixing with the received signal. As mentioned above the sinusoidal variation in the photo electron temporal density may be further detected by bandpass filtering the IF frequency filter and calculating the magnitude spectrum of the filtered signal via processor .

It should be appreciated that in alternative embodiments of LADAR system a two detection per pixel configuration with I and Q detection channels may be implemented.

LADAR system may be particularly useful when photon counting sensor of uses photo electron amplification devices that require high bias voltages which may be difficult to gate on and off at the high frequencies and the large bandwidths of the modulation waveforms required to achieve high range resolution.

It should be emphasized that many variations and modifications may be made to the above described embodiments. All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of this disclosure and protected by the following claims.
