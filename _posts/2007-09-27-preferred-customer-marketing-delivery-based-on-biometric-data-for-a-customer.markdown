The present invention is related generally to an improved data processing system and in particular to a method and apparatus for processing digital video data. More particularly the present invention is directed to a computer implemented method apparatus and computer usable program product for determining whether to deliver marketing content to a particular customer based on dynamically gathered biometric data for the particular customer.

In the past merchants frequently had a personal relationship with their customers. The merchant often knew their customers names address marital status ages of their children hobbies place of employment character anniversaries birthdays likes dislikes and personal preferences. The merchant was able to use this information to cater to customer needs and push sales of items the customer might be likely to purchase based on the customer s personal situation. The merchant was also able to determine whether a customer was a good customer that should receive special marketing efforts a credit risk or bad customer that should not receive special marketing offers or a customer that posed a risk or threat to the store or other customers based on the merchant s personal knowledge of the customer s character reputation and criminal history.

However with the continued growth of large cities the corresponding disappearance of small rural towns and the increasing number of large impersonal chain stores with multiple employees the merchants and employees of retail businesses rarely recognize regular customers and almost never know the customer s name or any other details regarding their customer s personal preferences that might assist the merchant or employee in marketing efforts directed toward a particular customer.

One solution to this problem is directed toward using data mining techniques to gather customer profile data. The customer profile data is used to generate marketing strategies for marketing products to customers. Customer profile data typically includes information provided by the customer in response to a questionnaire or survey such as the name address telephone number and gender of customers as well as products preferred by the customer. Demographic data regarding a customer s age sex income career interests hobbies and consumer preferences may also be included in customer profile data.

However these methods only provide limited and generalized marketing strategies that are directed towards a fairly large segment of the population without taking into account actual customer reactions to product placement in a particular retail store or to other environmental factors that may influence product purchases by customers.

In an attempt to better monitor customers in large retail stores these stores frequently utilize cameras and other audio and or video monitoring devices to record customers inside the retail store or in the parking lot. A store detective may watch one or more monitors displaying closed circuit images of customers in various areas inside the store to identify shoplifters. However these solutions require a human user to review the audio and video recordings. In addition the video and audio recordings are typically used only for store security.

Thus current solutions do not utilize all of the potential dynamic customer data elements that may be available for identifying customers that should be marketed to and customers that should not receive marketing content. The data elements currently being utilized to generate marketing strategies only provide approximately seventy five percent 75 of the needed customer data.

The illustrative embodiments provide a computer implemented method apparatus and computer usable program product for automatically determining a marketing status for a customer. In one embodiment the process receives biometric readings for the customer from a set of biometric devices associated with a retail facility to form the biometric data. The biometric data is data describing a set of physiological responses of the customer and wherein the biometric data is gathered in real time as the customer is shopping at the retail facility. The process analyzes the biometric data to identify a set of marketing initiation factors. The marketing initiation factors indicate a degree of receptivity of the customer to marketing messages.

In response to the set of marketing initiation factors indicating the customer is unreceptive to marketing messages the process sets the marketing status for the customer to a negative market status. A negative marketing status indicates that customized marketing messages are not generated or transmitted to any display devices for display to the customer. In response to the set of marketing initiation factors indicating initiation of marketing to the customer the process generates a customized marketing message for the customer.

In the depicted example network data processing system is the Internet with network representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP suite of protocols to communicate with one another. At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers consisting of thousands of commercial governmental educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course network data processing system also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks such as without limitation an intranet an Ethernet a local area network LAN and or a wide area network WAN .

Network data processing system may also include additional data storage devices in addition to or instead of storage area network such as without limitation one or more hard disks compact disks CD compact disk rewritable CD RW flash memory compact disk read only memory CD ROM non volatile random access memory NV RAM and or any other type of storage device for storing data.

In another embodiment digital customer marketing environment includes one or more servers located on site at digital customer marketing environment. In this example network is optional. In other words if one or more servers and or data processing systems are located at digital customer marketing environment the illustrative embodiments are capable of being implemented without requiring a network connection to computers located remotely to digital customer marketing environment .

A merchant owner operator manager or other employee associated with digital customer marketing environment typically wants to market products or services to customers in the most convenient and efficient manner possible so as to maximize resulting purchases by the customer and increase sales profits and or revenue. Therefore the aspects of the illustrative embodiments recognize that it is advantageous for the merchant to have as much information as possible describing one or more customers and to anticipate items that the customer may wish to purchase prior to the customer selecting those items for purchase in order to identify the best items to market to the customer and personalize the merchant s marketing strategy to that particular customer.

Therefore the illustrative embodiments provide a computer implemented method apparatus and computer program product for automatically determining a marketing status for a customer using biometric data. Biometric data is data describing a set of physiological responses of the customers a status state of a customer fingerprints thumbprints or a measurement of a vital statistics of the customer over a given period of time.

The vital statistics of the customers include a heart rate of the customer respiratory rate and or blood pressure. The set of physiological responses includes without limitation heart rate pupil dilation respiration blood pressure body temperature rate of perspiration and or voice stress for the voice of the customer.

The physiological responses are used to determine if one or more customers are reacting to external stimuli such as a marketing message a display device an item offered for sale or any other environmental element associated with the retail facility. A change in a biometric reading associated with a customer is compared with a threshold or baseline reading.

If the change in biometric readings exceeds or falls below the threshold the process determines that the customer was reacting to something in the environment. In response to a determination that the customer was viewing an item an item display a display device a marketing message or some other object when the change in the biometric reading occurred the process associates the change in the biometric reading with the item or the marketing message to form the biometric data. The change in the biometric readings may also be associated with a temperature change or odor in the environment. For example if the customer enters a freezer section of the retail facility a change in the customer s biometric readings may be attributed to the change in the ambient temperature.

In one embodiment the process receives biometric readings for a customer from a set of biometric devices associated with the retail facility to form the biometric data. The biometric data is gathered in real time as the customer is shopping at the retail facility. Real time refers to something that occurs immediately as or within some period of time needed to achieve the objective. In this case the biometric data is gathered in real time as the customer is shopping to achieve the objective of determining whether to present marketing content to the customer while the customer is still shopping.

The process analyzes the biometric data to identify a set of marketing initiation factors. The marketing initiation factors indicate a degree of receptivity of the customer to marketing messages. In response to the set of marketing initiation factors indicating that the customer is unreceptive to marketing messages the process sets the marketing status for the customer to a negative market status. A negative marketing status indicates that customized marketing messages are not generated for the customer and or transmitted to any display devices for display to the customer. In response to the set of marketing initiation factors indicating initiation of marketing to the customer the process generates a customized marketing message for the customer.

Retail facility is a facility for wholly or partially storing enclosing or displaying items for marketing viewing selection order and or purchase by a customer. For example retail facility may be without limitation a retail store supermarket grocery store a marketplace a food pavilion a book store clothing store department store or shopping mall. Retail facility may also include without limitation a sports arena amusement park water park convention center trade center or any other facility for housing storing displaying offering providing and or selling items. In this example retail facility is a grocery store or a department store.

Detectors are devices for gathering data associated with a set of customers including but not limited to at least one camera motion sensor device motion detector sonar detection device microphone sound audio recording device audio detection device a voice recognition system a heat sensor thermal sensor a seismograph a pressure sensor a device for detecting odors scents and or fragrances a radio frequency identification RFID tag reader a global positioning system GPS receiver and or any other detection device for detecting a presence of a human animal object and or vehicle located outside of retail facility . A set of customers is a set of one or more customers. A vehicle is any type of vehicle for conveying people animals or objects to a destination. A vehicle may include but is not limited to a car bus truck motorcycle boat airplane or any other type of vehicle.

A heat sensor is any known or available device for detecting heat such as but not limited to a thermal imaging device for generating images showing thermal heat patterns. A heat sensor can detect body heat generated by a human or animal and or heat generated by a vehicle such as an automobile or a motorcycle. A set of heat sensors may include one or more heat sensors.

A motion detector may be implemented in any type of known or available motion detector device. A motion detector device may include but is not limited to one or more motion detector devices using a photo sensor radar or microwave radio detector or ultrasonic sound waves.

A motion detector using ultrasonic sound waves transmits or emits ultrasonic sound waves. The motion detector detects or measures the ultrasonic sound waves that are reflected back to the motion detector. If a human animal or other object moves within the range of the ultrasonic sound waves generated by the motion detector the motion detector detects a change in the echo of sound waves reflected back. This change in the echo indicates the presence of a human animal or other object moving within the range of the motion detector.

In one example a motion detector device using a radar or microwave radio detector may detect motion by sending out a burst of microwave radio energy and detecting the same microwave radio waves when the radio waves are deflected back to the motion detector. If a human animal or other object moves into the range of the microwave radio energy field generated by the motion detector the amount of energy reflected back to the motion detector is changed. The motion detector identifies this change in reflected energy as an indication of the presence of a human animal or other object moving within the motion detectors range.

A motion detector device using a photo sensor detects motion by sending a beam of light across a space into a photo sensor. The photo sensor detects when a human animal or object breaks or interrupts the beam of light as the human animal or object by moving in between the source of the beam of light and the photo sensor. These examples of motion detectors are presented for illustrative purposes only. A motion detector in accordance with the illustrative embodiments may include any type of known or available motion detector and is not limited to the motion detectors described herein.

A pressure sensor detector may be for example a device for detecting a change in weight or mass associated with the pressure sensor. For example if one or more pressure sensors are imbedded in a sidewalk Astroturf or floor mat the pressure sensor detects a change in weight or mass when a human customer or animal steps on the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor may also detect when a human customer or animal steps off of the pressure sensor. In another example one or more pressure sensors are embedded in a parking lot and the pressure sensors detect a weight and or mass associated with a vehicle when the vehicle is in contact with the pressure sensor. A vehicle may be in contact with one or more pressure sensors when the vehicle is driving over one or more pressure sensors and or when a vehicle is parked on top of one or more pressure sensors.

A camera may be any type of known or available camera including but not limited to a video camera for taking moving video images a digital camera capable of taking still pictures and or a continuous video stream a stereo camera a web camera and or any other imaging device capable of capturing a view of whatever appears within the camera s range for remote monitoring viewing or recording of a distant or obscured person object or area.

Various lenses filters and other optical devices such as zoom lenses wide angle lenses mirrors prisms and the like may also be used with an image capture device to assist in capturing the desired view. The image capture device may be fixed in a particular orientation and configuration or it may along with any optical devices be programmable in orientation light sensitivity level focus or other parameters. Programming data may be provided via a computing device such as server in .

A camera may also be a stationary camera and or non stationary camera. A non stationary camera is a camera that is capable of moving and or rotating along one or more directions such as up down left right and or rotate about an axis of rotation. The camera may also be capable of moving to follow or track a person animal or object in motion. In other words the camera may be capable of moving about an axis of rotation in order to keep a customer animal or object within a viewing range of the camera lens. In this example detectors are non stationary digital video cameras. The camera may be coupled to and or in communication with the analysis server. In addition more than one image capture device may be operated simultaneously without departing from the illustrative embodiments of the present invention.

In this example detectors are located at locations along an outer perimeter of digital customer marketing environment . However detectors may be located at any position outside retail facility to detect customers before the customers enter retail facility and or when customers exit retail facility .

Detectors are connected to an analysis server on a data processing system such as network data processing system in . The analysis server is illustrated and described in greater detail in below. The analysis server includes software for analyzing digital images and other data captured by detectors to track and or visually identify retail items containers and or customers outside retail facility . Attachment of identifying marks may be part of this visual identification in the illustrative embodiments.

In this example four detectors detectors are located outside retail facility . However any number of detectors may be used to detect track and or gather dynamic data associated with customers outside retail facility . For example a single detector as well as two or more detectors may be used outside retail facility for tracking customers entering and or exiting retail facility . The dynamic customer data gathered by the one or more detectors in detectors is referred to herein as external data.

Retail facility may also optionally include a set of detectors not shown inside retail facility such as detectors for gathering dynamic data inside retail facility . The dynamic data gathered either inside or outside the retail facility includes without limitation grouping data identification data and or customer behavior data. The dynamic data associated with a customer that is captured inside the retail facility may be referred to as internal data while dynamic data gathered outside the retail facility may be referred to as external data.

The detectors in the set of detectors may include multiple detectors located at differing locations within retail facility . For example a detector may be located without limitation at an entrance to retail facility on one or more shelves in retail facility and or on one or more doors or doorways in retail facility . In one embodiment the set of detectors includes one or more cameras or other image capture devices for tracking and or identifying items containers for items shopping containers customers shopping companions of the customer shopping carts and or store employees inside retail facility such as camera .

Display devices are multimedia devices for displaying marketing messages to customers. Display devices may be any type of display device for presenting a text graphic audio video and or any combination of text graphics audio and video to a customer. In this example display devices are located inside retail facility . Display devices may be one or more display devices located within retail facility for use and or viewing by one or more customers. The images shown on display devices are changed in real time in response to various events such as without limitation the time of day the day of the week a particular customer approaching the shelves or rack items already placed inside container by the customer and dynamic data for the customer.

Display devices located outside retail facility include at least one display device. The display device s may be without limitation a display screen or a kiosk located in a parking lot queue line and or other area outside of retail facility . Display devices outside retail facility may be used in the absence of display devices inside retail facility or in addition to display devices .

Display device may be operatively connected to a data processing system via wireless infrared radio or other connection technologies known in the art for the purpose of transferring data to be displayed on display device . The data processing system includes the analysis server for analyzing dynamic gathered either inside or outside retail facility by detectors as well as static customer data obtained from one or more databases storing data associated with customers.

Biometric device is one or more biometric devices for gathering biometric data associated with one or more customers. Biometric device includes without limitation a fingerprint scanner a retinal scanner a voice analysis device a device for measuring heart rate respiration blood pressure body temperature or a device for capturing any other biometric reading associated with a customer.

Container is a container for holding carrying transporting or moving one or more items. For example container may be without limitation a shopping cart a shopping bag a shopping basket and or any other type of container for holding items. In this example container is a shopping cart. In this example in only one container is depicted. However any number of containers may be used inside and or outside retail facility for holding carrying transporting or moving items selected by customers.

Container may also optionally include identification tag . Identification tag is a tag for identifying container locating container within digital customer marketing environment either inside or outside retail facility and or associating container with a particular customer. For example identification tag may be a radio frequency identification RFID tag a universal product code UPC tag a global positioning system GPS tag and or any other type of identification tag for identifying locating and or tracking a container.

Container may also include display device coupled to mounted on attached to or imbedded within container . Display device is a multimedia display device for displaying textual graphical video and or audio marketing messages to a customer. For example display device may be a digital display screen or personal digital assistant attached to a handle front back or side member of container .

Container may optionally include an identification tag reader not shown for receiving data from identification tags associated with retail items . Retail items are items of merchandise for sale. Retail items may be displayed on a display shelf not shown located in retail facility . Other items of merchandise may be for sale such as without limitation food beverages shoes clothing household goods decorative items or sporting goods may be hung from display racks displayed in cabinets on shelves or in refrigeration units not shown . Any other type of merchandise display arrangement known in the retail trade may also be used in accordance with the illustrative embodiments. For example display shelves or racks may include in addition to retail items various advertising displays images or postings.

Retail items may be viewed or identified by the illustrative embodiments using an image capture device or other detector. To facilitate identification items may have attached identification tags . Identification tags are tags associated with one or more retail items for identifying the item and or location of the item. For example identification tags may be without limitation a bar code pattern such as a universal product code UPC or European article number EAN a radio frequency identification RFID tag or other optical identification tag depending on the capabilities of the image capture device and associated data processing system to process the information and make an identification of retail items . In some embodiments an optical identification may be attached to more than one side of a given item.

Biometric device is a device coupled or mounted to container for gathering biometric readings associated with the customer using container .

The data processing system discussed in greater detail in below includes associated memory which may be an integral part such as the operating memory of the data processing system or externally accessible memory. Software for tracking objects may reside in the memory and run on the processor. The software is capable of tracking retail items as a customer removes an item in retail items from its display position and places the item into container . Likewise the tracking software can track items which are being removed from container and placed elsewhere in the retail store whether placed back in their original display position or anywhere else including into another container. The tracking software can also track the position of container and the customer.

The software can track retail items by using data from one or more of detectors located externally to retail facility internal data captured by one or more detectors located internally to retail facility such as identification data received from identification tags and or identification data received from identification tag .

The software in the data processing system keeps a list of which items have been placed in each shopping container such as container . The list is stored in a database such as without limitation a spreadsheet relational database hierarchical database or the like. The database may be stored in the operating memory of the data processing system externally on a secondary data storage device locally on a recordable medium such as a hard drive floppy drive CD ROM DVD device remotely on a storage area network such as storage area network in or in any other type of storage device.

The lists of items in container are updated frequently enough to maintain a dynamic accurate real time listing of the contents of each container as customers add and remove items from containers such as container . The listings of items in containers are also made available to whatever inventory system is used in retail facility . Such listings represent an up to the minute view of which items are still available for sale for example to on line shopping customers or customers physically located at retail facility . The listings may also provide a demand side trigger back to the supplier of each item. In other words the listing of items in customer shopping containers can be used to update inventories determine current stock available for sale to customers and or identification of items that need to be restocked or replenished.

At any time the customer using container may request to see a listing of the contents of container by entering a query at a user interface to the data processing system. The user interface may be available at a kiosk computer personal digital assistant or other computing device connected to the data processing system via a network connection. The user interface may also be coupled to a display device such as at a display device in display devices display devices or display device associated with container . The customer may also make such a query after leaving the retail store. For example a query may be made using a portable device or a home computer workstation.

The listing is then displayed at a location where it may be viewed by the customer on a display device. The listing may include the quantity of each item in container as well as the brand price of each item discount or amount saved off the regular price of each item and a total price for all items in container . Other data may also be displayed as part of the listing such as additional incentives to purchase one or more other items.

When the customer is finished shopping the customer may proceed to a point of sale checkout station. The checkout station may be coupled to the data processing system in which case the items in container are already known to the data processing system due to the dynamic listing of items in container that is maintained as the customer shops in digital customer marketing environment . Thus there is no need for an employee customer or other person to scan each item in container to complete the purchase of each item as is commonly done today. In this example the customer merely arranges for payment of the total for example by use of a smart card credit card debit card cash or other payment method. In some embodiments it may not be necessary to empty container at the retail facility at all if container is a minimal cost item which can be kept by the customer.

In other embodiments container belongs to the customer. The customer brings container to retail facility at the start of the shopping session. In another embodiment container belongs to retail facility and must be returned before the customer leaves digital customer marketing environment .

In another example when the customer is finished shopping the customer may complete checkout either in aisle or from a final or terminal based checkout position in the store using a transactional device which may be integral with container or associated temporarily to container . The customer may also complete the transaction using a consumer owned computing device such as a laptop cellular telephone or personal digital assistant that is connected to the data processing system via a network connection.

The customer may also make payment by swiping a magnetic strip on a card using any known or available radio frequency identification RFID enabled payment device or using a biometric device for identifying the customer by the customer s fingerprint voiceprint thumbprint and or retinal pattern. In such as case the customer s account is automatically charged after the customer is identified.

The transactional device may also be a portable device such as a laptop computer palm device or any other portable device specially configured for such in aisle checkout service whether integral with container or separately operable. In this example the transactional device connects to the data processing system via a network connection to complete the purchase transaction at check out time.

Checkout may be performed in aisle or at the end of the shopping trip whether from any point or from a specified point of transaction. As noted above checkout transactional devices may be stationary shared devices or portable or mobile devices offered to the customer from the store or may be devices brought to the store by the customer which are compatible with the data processing system and software residing on the data processing system.

Thus in this depicted example when a customer enters digital customer marketing environment but before the customer enters retail facility such as a retail store the customer is detected and identified by one or more detectors in detectors to generate external data. The customer identification may be an exact identification of the customer by name identification by an identifier or an anonymous identification that is used to track the customer even though the customer s exact name and identity is not known. If the customer takes a shopping container before entering retail facility the shopping container is also identified. In some embodiments the customer may be identified through identification of container .

An analysis server in a data processing system associated with retail facility begins performing data mining on available static customer data such as but not limited to customer profile information and demographic information for use in generating customized marketing messages targeted to the customer. In one embodiment the customer is presented with customized digital marketing messages on one or more display devices in display devices located externally to retail facility before the customer enters retail facility .

The customer is tracked using image data and or other detection data captured by detectors as the customer enters retail facility . The customer is identified and tracked inside retail facility by one or more detectors inside the facility.

When the customer enters retail facility the customer is typically offered provided or permitted to take shopping container for use during shopping.

When the customer takes a shopping container such as container the analysis server uses data from detectors such as identification data from identification tags and to track container and items selected by the customer and placed in container .

As a result an item selected by the customer for example as the customer removes the item from its stationary position on a store display is identified. The selected item may be traced visually by a camera tracked by another type of detector such as an audio detector a motion detector a pressure sensor or a heat sensor and or using identification data from identification tags . The item is tracked until the customer places it in container to form a selected item.

Thus a selected item is identified when a customer removes an item from a store display such as a shelf display counter basket or hanger. In another embodiment the selected item is identified when the customer places the item in the customer s shopping basket shopping bag or shopping cart.

Container may contain a digital media display such as display device mounted on container and or customer may be offered a handheld digital media display device such as a display device in display devices . In the alternative the customer may be encouraged to use strategically placed kiosks running digital media marketing messages throughout retail facility . Display device and or may include a verification device for verifying an identity of the customer.

For example display device may include a radio frequency identification tag reader for reading a radio frequency identification tag a smart card reader for reading a smart card or a card reader for reading a specialized store loyalty or frequent customer card. Once the customer has been verified the data processing system retrieves past purchase history total potential wallet share shopper segmentation information customer profile data granular demographic data for the customer and or any other available customer data elements using known or available data retrieval and or data mining techniques. These customer data elements are analyzed using at least one data model to determine appropriate digital media content to be pushed on demand throughout the store to customers viewing display devices and or display device .

The customer is provided with incentives to use display devices and or display device to obtain marketing incentives promotional offers and discounts for items. When the customer has finished shopping the customer may be provided with a list of savings or tiered accounting of savings over the regular price of purchased items if a display device had not been used to view and use customized digital marketing messages.

In this example a single container and a single customer is described. However the aspects of the illustrative embodiments may also be used to track multiple containers and multiple customers simultaneously. In this case the analysis server will store a separate listing of selected items for each active customer. As noted above the listings may be stored in a database.

The data models in set of data models are generated using at least one of a statistical method a data mining method a causal model a mathematical model a marketing model a behavioral model a psychological model a sociological model or a simulation model.

Profile data is data regarding one or more customers. In this example profile data includes point of contact data profiled past data current actions data transactional history data certain click stream data granular demographics psychographic data registration e.g. customer provided data and account data and or any other data regarding a customer.

Point of contact data is data regarding a method or device used by a customer to interact with a data processing system of a merchant or supplier and or receive customized marketing message for display. The customer may interact with the merchant or supplier using a computing device or display terminal having a user interface for inputting data and or receiving output. The device or terminal may be a device provided by the retail facility and or a device belonging to or provided by the customer. For example the display or access device may include but is not limited to a cellular telephone a laptop computer a desktop computer a computer terminal kiosk personal digital assistant PDA such as a personal digital assistant in or personal digital assistant in or any other display or access device such as display device .

If display device is a display device associated with the retail facility details and information regarding display device will be known to analysis server . However if display device is a display device belonging to the customer or brought to the retail facility by the customer analysis server may identify the type of display device using techniques such as interrogation commands cookies or any other known or equivalent technique. From the type of device other constraints may be determined such as display size resolution refresh rate color capability keyboard entry capability other entry capability such as pointer or mouse speech recognition and response language constraints and any other fingertip touch point constraints and assumptions about customer state of the display device. For example someone using a cellular phone may have a limited time window for making phone calls and be sensitive to location and local time of day whereas a casual home browser may have a greater luxury of time and faster connectivity.

An indication of a location for the point of contact may also be determined. For example global positioning system GPS coordinates of the customer may be determined if the customer device has such a capability whether by including a real time global positioning system receiver or by periodically storing global positioning system coordinates entered by some other method. Other location indications may also be determined such as post office address street or crossroad coordinates latitude longitude coordinates or any other location indicating system.

The processed dynamic data is analyzed and or further processed using one or more data models in set of data models .

Marketing initiation engine is software for analyzing dynamic data using a first set of data models in set of data models to identify a set of marketing initiation factors and set marketing status flag associated with the customer using the set of marketing initiation factors. The marketing initiation factors indicate a degree of receptivity of the customer to marketing messages and sets a status of the customer to an initiate marketing status in response to the set of marketing initiation factors indicating initiation of marketing to the customer.

Marketing status flag in profile data is a flag in a customer profile for a particular customer. Marketing status flag indicates whether customized marketing messages are delivered to the customer. The customized marketing messages are displayed to the customer in response to marketing initiation engine setting marketing status flag to a market status. Marketing initiation engine sets the marketing status for the customer to a no market status in response to the set of marketing initiation factors indicating the customer is unreceptive to marketing messages. A no marketing status indicates that customized marketing messages are not transmitted to any display devices for display to the customer.

In this example marketing initiation engine retrieves a customer profile for the customer from profile data . The customer profile indicates customary days of the week the customer has shopped in the past customary times of day when the customer has shopped at the retail facility a customary grouping category and or past behavior of the customer while shopping at the retail facility on a different shopping trip.

The customary day of the week is a day of the week on which the customer shops frequently or customarily shops. A day of the week is a customary day of the week if the customer has shopped at the retail facility on that day of the week for a threshold percentage of the total shopping visits. In another embodiment a day of the week is a customary day of the week if the customer has shopped at the retail facility on that day of the week for a threshold number of times.

In response to determining that the current day of the week is a customary day of the week in the customary days of the week the customer has shopped in the past marketing initiation engine generates positive marketing initiation factors. If the current day of the week is not a customary day of the week in the customary days of the week the customer has shopped in the past marketing initiation engine generates negative marketing initiation factors.

The customary time of day is a time of the day during which the customer frequently or customarily shops. A time of day is a customary time of day if the customer has shopped at the retail facility at that time of day for a threshold percentage of the customer s total shopping visits. In another embodiment a time of day is a time of day if the customer has shopped at the retail facility at that time of day for a threshold number of times.

If the current time falls within a range of the customary times of day marketing initiation engine generates positive marketing initiation factors. If the current time falls outside of a range of the customary times of day marketing initiation engine generates negative marketing initiation factors.

Grouping data is dynamic data that identifies a grouping category for the customer. A grouping category is a description of a group or shopping companions of the customer while the customer is shopping. A grouping category includes without limitation parents with children teenagers children minors unaccompanied by adults minors accompanied by adults grandparents with grandchildren senior citizens couples friends coworkers customer with a pet customer with a dog customer with a cat and a customer shopping alone.

A customary grouping category describes the companions a customer usually shops with. If the current grouping category for the customer is a customary grouping category in the customary grouping categories marketing initiation engine generates positive marketing initiation factors. If the current grouping category for the customer is a grouping category that is different than the customary grouping categories marketing initiation engine generates negative marketing initiation factors. For example if a customary grouping category indicates the customer usually shops alone and the current grouping category indicates the customer is shopping with three children marketing initiation engine generates negative marketing initiation factors.

Marketing initiation engine compares the current customer behavior data to the past customer behavior data. If the comparison indicates the customer is walking at a customary pace or shopping at a customary rate marketing initiation engine generates positive marketing initiation factors. If the comparison indicates the customer is walking at a pace that is faster than the customary pace or shopping at a rate that is faster than the customary rate of shopping marketing initiation engine generates negative marketing initiation factors.

Biometric data is captured by a set of one or more biometric devices associated with a customer. Biometric devices include without limitation a fingerprint scanner a retinal scanner a voice analysis device a device for measuring heart rate respiration blood pressure body temperature or a device for capturing any other biometric reading associated with a customer.

Marketing initiation engine analyzes the biometric data to identify a set of marketing initiation factors. The marketing initiation factors indicate a degree of receptivity of the customer to marketing messages.

If biometric data indicates the customer is responding or reacting to marketing content marketing initiation engine generates positive marketing initiation factors. If biometric data indicates the customer is not responding or reacting to marketing content or biometric data indicates the customer is not receptive to marketing marketing initiation engine generates negative marketing initiation factors.

Content server is any type of known or available server for storing modular marketing messages . Content server may be a server such as server in or data processing system in .

Modular marketing messages are two or more self contained marketing messages that may be combined with one or more other modular marketing messages in modular marketing messages to form a customized marketing message for display to the customer. Modular marketing messages can be quickly and dynamically assembled and disseminated to the customer in real time.

In this illustrative example modular marketing messages are pre generated. In other words modular marketing messages are preexisting marketing message units that are created prior to analyzing dynamic data associated with a customer using one or more data models to generate a personalized marketing message for the customer. Two or more modular marketing messages are combined to dynamically generate customized marketing message customized or personalized for a particular customer. Although modular marketing messages are pre generated modular marketing messages may also include templates imbedded within modular marketing messages for adding personalized information such as a customer s name or address to the customized marketing message.

Derived marketing messages is a software component for determining which modular marketing messages in modular marketing messages should be combined or utilized to dynamically generate customized marketing message for the customer in real time. Derived marketing messages uses the output generated by analysis server as a result of analyzing dynamic data associated with a customer using one or more appropriate data models in set of data models to identify one or more modular marketing messages for the customer. The output generated by analysis server from analyzing dynamic data using appropriate data models in set of data models includes marketing message criteria for the customer.

In other words dynamic data is analyzed to generate personal marketing message criteria. Derived marketing messages uses the marketing message criteria for the customer to select one or more modular marketing messages in modular marketing messages .

A customized marketing message is generated using personalized marketing message criteria that are identified using the dynamic data. Personalized marketing message criteria are criterion or indicators for selecting one or more modular marketing messages for inclusion in the customized marketing message. The personalized marketing message criteria may include one or more criterion. The personalized marketing message criteria may be generated in part a priori or pre generated and in part dynamically in real time based on the dynamic data for the customer and or any available static customer data associated with the customer. Dynamic data includes external data gathered outside the retail facility and or dynamic data gathered inside the retail facility.

If an analysis of dynamic data indicates that the customer is shopping with a large dog the personal marketing message criteria may include criteria to indicate marketing of pet food and items for large dogs. Because people with large dogs often have large yards the personal marketing message criteria may also indicate that yard items such as yard fertilizer weed killer or insect repellant may should be marketed. The personal marketing message criteria may also indicate marketing elements designed to appeal to animal lovers and pet owners such as incorporating images of puppies images of dogs phrases such as man s best friend puppy love advice on pet care and dog health and or other pet friendly images phrases and elements to appeal to the customer s tastes and interests.

Derived marketing messages uses the output of one or more data models in set of data models that were used to analyze dynamic data associated with a customer to identify one or more modular marketing messages to be combined together to form the personalized marketing message for the customer.

For example a first modular marketing message may be a special on a more expensive brand of peanut butter. A second modular marketing message may be a discount on jelly when peanut butter is purchased. In response to marketing message criteria that indicates the customer frequently purchases cheaper brands of peanut butter the customer has children and the customer is currently in an aisle of the retail facility that includes jars of peanut butter derived marketing messages will select the first marketing message and the second marketing message based on the marketing message criteria for the customer.

Dynamic marketing message assembly is a software component for combining the one or more modular marketing messages selected by derived marketing messages to form customized marketing message . Dynamic marketing message assembly combines modular marketing messages selected by derived marketing messages to create appropriate customized marketing message for the customer. In the example above after derived marketing messages selects the first modular marketing message and the second modular marketing message based on the marketing message criteria dynamic marketing message assembly combines the first and second modular marketing messages to generate a customized marketing message offering the customer a discount on both the peanut butter and jelly if the customer purchases the more expensive brand of peanut butter. In this manner dynamic marketing message assembly provides assembly of customized marketing message based on output from the data models analyzing dynamic data.

Customized marketing message is a customized and unique marketing message for a customer. The marketing message is a one to one customized marketing message for a specific customer. Customized marketing message is generated using dynamic data and or static customer data elements such as the customer s demographics and psychographics to achieve this unique one to one marketing.

Customized marketing message is generated for a particular customer based on dynamic customer data elements such as grouping data customer identification data current events data and customer behavior data. For example if modular marketing messages include marketing messages identified by numerals customized marketing message may be generated using marketing messages and . In this example modular marketing messages and are combined to create a customized marketing message that is generated for display to the customer rather than displaying the exact same marketing messages to all customers. Customized marketing message is displayed on display device .

Customized marketing message may include advertisements sales special offers incentives opportunities promotional offers rebate information and or rebate offers discounts and opportunities. An opportunity may be a take action opportunity such as asking the customer to make an immediate purchase select a particular item request a download provide information or take any other type of action.

Customized marketing message may also include content or messages pushing advertisements and opportunities to effectively and appropriately drive the point of contact customer to some conclusion or reaction desired by the merchant.

Customized marketing message is formed in a dynamic closed loop manner in which the content delivery depends on dynamic data as well as other dynamic customer data elements and static customer data such as profile data and granular demographics . Therefore all interchanges with the customer may sense and gather data associated with customer behavior which is used to generate customized marketing message .

Turning now to a flowchart illustrating a process for monitoring for a change in biometric readings associated with a customer is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The process may be implemented by a device for measuring physiological responses and or traits of a customer such as biometric device in and or biometric device in .

The process begins by monitoring biometric readings of a customer obtained from a set of one or more biometric devices step . The process makes a determination as to whether a change in the biometric readings that exceeds a threshold change has been detected step . If a change exceeding the threshold is not detected the process terminates thereafter.

Returning to step if a change exceeding the threshold is detected the process makes a determination as to whether the customer was viewing an item a marketing message or some other identifiable person place or thing when the change in biometric readings occurred step . If the customer was not viewing an item a marketing message or some other identifiable person place or thing the process terminates thereafter.

Returning to step if the customer was viewing an item marketing message or something else identifiable the process associates the change in biometric reading with the item the marketing message or the identifiable person place or thing to form the biometric data step . The process transmits the biometric data to an analysis server and or stores the biometric data in a data storage device for current use and or for later use in generating customized marketing messages step with the process terminating thereafter.

The process makes a determination as to whether the customer is shopping on a customary day step . For example if the customer shops on Saturdays a majority of the time and the customer is now shopping on a Monday the customer is not shopping on a customary day of the week. In another embodiment the customer is not shopping on a customary day if the customer is shopping on a day of the week on which the customer has never shopped before or a day of the week on which the customer has not shopped on for at least a threshold number of times. If the customer is not shopping on a customary day of the week the process generates negative marketing initiation factors step .

The process makes a determination as to whether the customer is shopping at a customary time of the day step . For example if a majority of the customer s shopping visits to the retail facility take place in the afternoon and the customer is now shopping at midnight the customer is not shopping at a customary time of day. In another embodiment the customer is not shopping at a customary time of day if the customer is shopping at a time of day at which the customer has never shopped before or at a time of day on which the customer has not shopped for at least a threshold number of times. In other words if the customer has not shopped at midnight for at least a threshold number of shopping visits to the retail facility the customer is not shopping at a customary time of day. If the customer is not shopping at a customary time of day the process generates negative marketing initiation factors step .

The process makes a determination as to whether the customer s biometric data and any available dynamic data such as behavior data indicates the customer is shopping at a leisurely or customary pace step . If the customer s behavior is hurried or rushed the customer s heart rate or blood pressure is high biometric data indicates the customer is experiencing stress the customer is walking at a fast pace the customer is not taking as much time as normal to browse the store shelves and or the customer is selecting items more quickly than usual the customer is not shopping at a leisurely pace. If the customer is not shopping at a leisurely or customary pace the process generates negative marketing initiation factors step . The process then makes a determination as to whether biometric data indicates the customer is receptive to marketing step . Biometric data may indicate the customer is receptive if the customer s biometric data indicates the customer is calm and relaxed and or responding to other marketing content. Biometric data indicates the customer is not responsive to marketing if the customers biometric data does not indicate a change in biometric readings when the customer is viewing marketing messages displays and or items. Biometric data also indicates the customer is unreceptive if the biometric readings indicate the customer is under stress rushed or agitated.

If the customer is not receptive to marketing the process generates negative marketing initiation factors step with the process terminating thereafter. If the customer s biometric data indicates the customer is receptive to marketing at step the process generates positive marketing initiation factors step with the process termination thereafter.

The steps in may be implemented in any order. Thus step may be implemented before step . In addition step may be implemented after step and step . In other words positive marketing initiation factors may be generated in response to the customer shopping on a customary day of the week even if the customer is not shopping at a customary time of day. Positive marketing initiation factors may be generated for the customer shopping on a customary day and or a customary time of day even if the customer s behavior does not indicate the customer is shopping at a leisurely pace. In another example if the customer is shopping on a customary day of the week at a customary time of day and the customer s behavior indicates the customer is shopping at a leisurely pace the process generates positive marketing initiation factors indicating that marketing content should be generated for the customer.

The process receives biometric data for the customer step . The dynamic data is generated in real time as the customer is shopping. The process analyzes the biometric data with any available dynamic data to identify marketing initiation factors step for the customer. In one embodiment this step involves analyzing the biometric data and dynamic data in a set of data models.

The process makes a determination as to whether marketing to the customer is desirable using the marketing initiation factors step . Marketing to the customer is desirable if the customer is likely to be receptive to marketing messages. If marketing is desirable the process initiates generation of customized marketing messages for the customer step with the process terminating thereafter. If marketing to the customer is not desirable at step the process does not generate marketing messages for the customer step with the process terminating thereafter.

The process begins by retrieving any available dynamic data for a customer step . The dynamic data includes without limitation grouping data external data customer identification data vehicle identification data customer behavior data and or any other dynamic customer data elements. The process retrieves biometric data for the customer step .

The process pre generates or creates in advance appropriate data models using at least one of a statistical method data mining method causal model mathematical model marketing model behavioral model psychographical model sociological model simulations modeling techniques and or any combination of models data mining statistical methods simulations and or modeling techniques step .

The process analyzes the biometric data with any available dynamic data using one or more of the appropriate data models to identify a set of personalized marketing message criteria step . The set of personalized marketing message criteria may include one or more criterion for generating a personalized marketing message. The process dynamically builds a set of one or more customized marketing messages using the personalized marketing message criteria step . The process transmits the set of customized marketing messages to a display device associated with the customer step for presentation of the marketing message to the customer with the process terminating thereafter.

Thus the illustrative embodiments provide a computer implemented method apparatus and computer program product for automatically determining a marketing status for a customer. In one embodiment the process receives biometric readings for the customer from a set of biometric devices associated with a retail facility to form the biometric data. The biometric data is data describing a set of physiological responses of the customer and wherein the biometric data is gathered in real time as the customer is shopping at the retail facility. The process analyzes the biometric data to identify a set of marketing initiation factors. The marketing initiation factors indicate a degree of receptivity of the customer to marketing messages.

In response to the set of marketing initiation factors indicating the customer is unreceptive to marketing messages the process sets the marketing status for the customer to a negative market status. A negative marketing status indicates that customized marketing messages are not generated or transmitted to any display devices for display to the customer. In response to the set of marketing initiation factors indicating initiation of marketing to the customer the process generates a customized marketing message for the customer.
