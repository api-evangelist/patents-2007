The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefore.

The invention relates to target detection and tracking apparatus and is directed more particularly to an acoustic sensor assembly for detecting and tracking noise producing and or noise reflecting objects in an ocean environment.

Marine vessels such as submarines and surface ships are typically provided with acoustic sensor assemblies. In such assemblies a laser scanner is disposed and oriented so as to project a laser beam onto an after surface of an acoustic panel the sensor being disposed and oriented so as to receive reflections of the laser beam off the acoustic panel and to transmit data from which a position of a sound generating source can be determined. An example of such an acoustic sensor assembly is shown and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 349 791.

Only the sound incident on a forward surface of the acoustic panel that is incoming sound from the water is desired to be measured. The sound incident on the after side of the panel originates from inside the vessel e.g. as a result of reflections and is considered to be only noise . Because the system cannot distinguish between incoming sound and noise there is a need to diminish or eliminate internal reflections that are otherwise detected.

Accordingly an object of the invention is to provide a marine acoustic sensor assembly which measures substantially only the sound incident on the forward surface of the acoustic panel while greatly decreasing or eliminating sound incident on the after surface of the acoustic panel.

With the above and other objects in view a feature of the present invention is the provision of a marine acoustic sensor assembly comprising an acoustic panel having a forward surface and an after surface a laser scanner disposed proximate and removed from the acoustic panel after surface the laser scanner being oriented so as to project a laser beam onto the acoustic panel after surface and a sensor disposed and oriented so as to receive reflections of the laser beam off the acoustic panel and to transmit data from which a position of a sound generating source can be determined wherein the acoustic panel is provided with an absorber layer extending over the after surface of the acoustic panel and wherein the absorber layer is provided with holes extending therethrough the holes being of a size sufficient to permit passage of the laser beams therethrough to the acoustic panel after surface and the reflections to pass therethrough and to the sensor whereby to minimize reflections and noise originating from aft of the after surface while permitting sound incoming from forward of the acoustic panel to be measured.

In accordance with a further feature of the invention there is provided a bow dome acoustic sensor assembly including an outer hull portion an inner pressure hull wall extending athwartship and in conjunction with the outer hull bow portion defining a free flood compartment an acoustic bow panel disposed in the compartment and connected to the pressure hull wall by acoustically isolating supports extending from the base panel to the pressure hull wall a laser scanner disposed in the compartment and oriented so as to project a laser beam onto an after surface of the acoustic bow panel the after surface of the acoustic bow panel having a sound absorber layer extending thereover the absorber layer being provided with holes extending therethrough the holes exposing portions of the after surface of the acoustic bow panel and a sensor disposed in the compartment and oriented so as to receive reflections of the laser beam off the acoustic panel after surface exposed portions and to transmit data from which a position of a sound generating source can be determined.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to it will be seen that a bow dome acoustic sensor assembly includes a forward most outer hull portion of the submarine or surface ship known as the bow dome . Proximate the base of bow dome is a pressure hull portion extending athwartships and in conjunction with bow dome defining a zone .

Disposed within the zone is an acoustic panel of lightweight rigid material such as an aromatic polyamide material or other relatively stiff plastic or aluminum or other material sufficiently rigid to be self supporting. The panel is of a diameter such as to substantially fill the available space within the bow dome. The acoustic panel is mounted on pressure hull portion by way of acoustically isolating supports . An after surface of the acoustic panel is provided with optical properties which permit analysis of light from a laser as is known in the art.

Further disposed within the zone is a laser scanner mounted in a vibrationally insulated manner. The laser scanner is oriented to cast a laser beam on the after surface of the acoustic panel . Such laser scanners are known in the art and often referred to a vibrometers which operate to move a laser beam rapidly over a surface. The surface can be of any configuration and the beam can be moved in any pattern.

A sensor is provided and may be in the same housing as the scanner as illustrated in the drawings. The sensor receives reflections of the laser beam off the acoustic panel surface . The velocity of the scanned sections of the acoustic panel caused by impinging sound waves passing through the bow dome can be determined by doppler shift of the reflected light received by the sensor . The aforementioned optical properties of the acoustic panel surface cause reflection of the reflected laser beam for collection by the sensor . A plurality of laser scanners can be used to increase the speed at which the entire acoustic panel surface is scanned. The data relative to speed of acoustic wave induced vibration of the acoustic panel is transmitted from sensor to an onboard computer not shown for calculation of location and direction and speed of movement of a noise producing object in the ocean environment.

The assembly as described above is capable of passive detection that is receiving and analyzing noises from the ocean environment.

The assembly is provided with an acoustic sources array to facilitate operations of an active detection character. The acoustic sources may be pingers or the like for sending forth sound waves which are reflected by objects in the water back to the acoustic panel . Thus the assembly provides for both passive and active modes of operation.

In operation zone is flooded with sea water in which the acoustic panel and other components of the assembly are submerged. Through either active or passive operation sound waves pass through the outer hull and impinge upon the acoustic panel inducing vibrations in the panel . The laser scanner scans surface with laser beam to obtain reflections at sensor . Frequency changes of the received reflections provide velocities on the surface for computer analysis to obtain the position course and speed of a noise generating or reflecting object.

Referring to it will be seen that in accordance with the invention the after surface of the acoustic panel is provided with a layer of sound absorbing material which prevents most of the aforementioned interior noise from reaching the after surface of the acoustic panel . The layer is provided with holes extending therethrough to the acoustic panel after surface . The holes are of sufficient size for laser beams to pass through but are very small compared to an acoustic wavelength so that the absorber operation is not significantly compromised. For example each hole may be on the order of one millimeter diameter which permits laser detection but will allow very little unwanted acoustic energy to be reflected back to the sensor . The hole diameter preferably is less than one millimeter for ultrasonic applications having smaller wavelengths.

There is thus provided an acoustic sensor assembly wherein a layer of absorbent material blocks reflection of internal noises which would otherwise be detected along with the externally originated target sound.

Each hole forms the center of a virtual hydrophone. A single laser may scan each virtual hydrophone center on the entire dome surface or multiple lasers may be used to scan smaller numbers of virtual hydrophone centers. In either system the absorber layer serves to block internal reflections which otherwise would be detected by the virtual hydrophones.

There is thus provided a marine acoustic sensor assembly which is operative to minimize reflections and noise originating from inside the vessel in which the assembly is mounted while permitting sound incoming from an ocean environment to be detected and measured.

There is further provided a bow dome acoustic sensor assembly adapted to detect and measure sound incoming from the surrounding ocean environment while minimizing the influence of internally generated noise and the effects it might have on target detection.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
