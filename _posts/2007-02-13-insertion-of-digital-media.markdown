title: Insertion of digital media
abstract: An example embodiment of the present invention provides a process for inserting a source media stream into a target media stream. The process opens and reads into memory structural information from a target media stream. The process then opens and reads into memory structural information from a source media stream. The process adjusts the structural information for both streams in order to effect the insertion of the source media stream into the target media stream. In the example embodiment, this adjustment avoids the use of temporary output storage. The process then writes onto an output media stream the adjusted structural information for the source and target media streams and then pipes onto the output media stream the media data for the source and target media streams. In particular embodiments, a container file format is used for the source media stream, target media stream, and output media stream.

This application is related to the following commonly owned U.S. patents whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 789 680 entitled Ad Campaign Management System for Mobile Devices filed on Apr. 6 2006 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 789 709 entitled Dynamic Ad Insertion System filed on Apr. 6 2006.

The present disclosure relates to the insertion of one or more source media content into a target media content.

As described in detail in the related applications incorporated by reference above a scalable system has been developed that supports the dynamic insertion of advertisement media or other digital content into the content media communicated to mobile devices such as cellular telephones and media players.

Inserting one piece of media into another is not simply a matter of splicing them together in a manner reminiscent of splicing film or analog audio tape. Many media file formats are specific to the encoding of their content. For example MPG and MP3 file formats are each tightly tied to the underlying encoding of the media. Therefore any software that processes files in these formats must have knowledge of the underlying encoding method or codec.

Furthermore if the media to be inserted does not use the same encoding as the target media the media to be inserted must be transcoded. Transcoding is the direct digital to digital conversion from one codec usually lossy to another. It involves decoding decompressing the original data to a raw intermediate format e.g. PCM for audio or YUV for video in a way that mimics standard playback of the lossy content and then re encoding this into the target format.

A container file format is a computer file format that can contain various types of data encoded by means of standardized codecs. Typically a container file format will include an additional layer of indirection in the form of data pointers which software can manipulate instead of the data itself. Consequently container file formats facilitate editing in place without copying of data.

MPEG 4 Part 14 is a standard for a container format for multimedia files. Since the official filename extension for MPEG 4 Part 14 files is .mp4 the container format is often referred to simply as MP4. The MP4 format is ordinarily used to store digital audio and digital video streams where the term stream here refers to a succession of data elements made available over time. MP4 was initially based on Apple s QuickTime container format but has since been improved. For the details of the latter container format see the QuickTime File Format Apple 2001 Mar. 1 .

MP4 files have a logical structure a time structure and a physical structure and these structures are not required to be coupled. The logical structure of the file is of a movie that in turn contains a set of time parallel tracks of media streams. The time structure of the file is that the tracks contain sequences of samples in time and those sequences are mapped into the timeline of the overall movie by optional edit lists. The physical structure of the file separates the data needed for logical time and structural de composition from the media data samples themselves.

Also in terms of physical structure the MP4 file format is composed of object oriented structures called atoms . A unique tag and a length identify each atom. An atom can be a parent to other atoms or it can contain data but it cannot do both. Most atoms describe a hierarchy of metadata giving information such as index points durations and pointers to the media data. This collection of atoms is contained in an atom called the movie atom . The movie atom documents the logical and timing relationships of the samples and also contains pointers to where they are located. Those pointers may be into the same file or another one referenced by a URL. The media data itself is located elsewhere it can be in the MP4 file contained in one or more mdat or media data atoms or located outside the MP4 file and referenced via URL s.

Each media stream is contained in a track specialized for that media type audio video etc. and is further parameterized by a sample entry. The sample entry contains the name of the exact media type i.e. the type of the decoder needed to decode the stream and any parameterization of that decoder needed. The name takes the form of a four character code. There are defined sample entry formats not only for MP4 media but also for the media types used by other organizations using this file format family. They are registered at the MP4 registration authority. See the white paper on MPEG 4 File Formats by David Singer and Mohammed Zubair Visharam October 1995 Nice .

Like most other modern container formats the MP4 format supports streaming over a network such as the Internet or other stream delivery mechanism. Streaming media is media that is consumed e.g. heard or viewed while it is being delivered. Streaming is more a property of the system delivering the media than the media itself. The term streaming is usually applied to media that is distributed over computer networks. Most other delivery systems are either inherently streaming such as radio and television or inherently non streaming such as books video cassettes and audio CDs.

The MP4 file format is a streamable format as opposed to a streaming format. The file format is designed to be independent of any particular delivery protocol while enabling efficient support for delivery in general. Metadata in the file known as hint tracks provide instructions telling a server application how to deliver the media data over a particular delivery protocol. There can be multiple hint tracks for one presentation describing how to deliver over various delivery protocols. In this way the file format facilitates streaming without ever being streamed directly. See MPEG 4 Overview V.21 Jeju Version edited by Rob Koenen March 2002 .

In one embodiment wireless network includes at least one base station or other radio transmit receive unit operably connected to a base station controller e.g. a Base Station Controller BSC a Radio Network Controller RNC etc. .

The present invention can be deployed in connection with one to a plurality of wireless network types. For example wireless network may be a cellular or Personal Communication System PCS network employing several possible technologies including Time Division Multiple Access TDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDMA and Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA communication. Communication of data between mobile stations and gateway can occur over any suitable bearer service. In one embodiment mobile stations can establish circuit switched or dial up connections to a gateway an interface to external systems or networks such as a WAP or MMS gateway associated with the wireless carrier. For example in GSM networks Short Message Service SMS or Circuit Switched Data CSD bearer services may be used. In addition mobile stations or terminals may establish packet switched connections to gateway using General Packet Radio Services GPRS bearer services. Other bearer service types may include High Speed Circuit Switched Data HSCSD Enhanced Data GSM Environment EDGE . Wireless network can also be a Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service UMTS network enabling broadband packet based transmission of text digitized voice video and multimedia.

As illustrates the present invention can be deployed in an environment involving multiple wireless network types. For example core network may be operably connected to a GSM network including one or more base stations and base station controllers . Base station controller may be logically associated with a packet control unit to operate in connection with at least one Serving GPRS Support Node and at least one Gateway GPRS Support Node to provide packet switched network services. Core network may also support a packet switched UMTS network comprising one or more Node Bs and at least one radio network controller . Core network may also support circuit switched wireless networks such as traditional GSM PCS or cellular networks

Accordingly wireless network may comprise a variety of systems and subsystems. For example in a GSM network the wireless network may comprise one or more base transceiver stations operably connected to a base station controller . As illustrates the base station controller is connected to core network via a SGSN which handles access control and other tasks associated with GPRS services for mobile stations accessing the network. In GPRS networks the base station controller may include a packet control unit which operates in connection with at least one SGSN and a GGSN to provide the GPRS service to mobile stations . Core network may further include a mobile telephone switching office MTSO or mobile switching center MSC that connects the landline PSTN system to the wireless network system and is also responsible for handing off calls from one cell or base station to another. also illustrates UMTS network comprising one or more node Bs operably connected to a radio network controller . Core network may further include media gateway a switching device that terminates circuit switched channels from a wireless network and connections from packet switched core network that supports access to voice and data services for other wireless network types.

Core network includes functionality supporting operation of the wireless network as well as functionality integrating circuit and packet switched network traffic. In one embodiment core network comprises at least one routing device such as router to route data packets between nodes connected to the core network . As discussed above in one embodiment core network includes at least one Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN and at least one Serving GPRS Support Node SGSN . The Gateway GPRS Support Node supports the edge routing function of the core network . To external packet data networks such as network the GGSN performs the task of an IP router. In one embodiment the GGSN also includes firewall and filtering functionality to protect the integrity of the core network . The SGSN in one embodiment connects a base station controller to core network . The SGSN in one embodiment keeps track of the location of an individual mobile station and performs security functions and access control. Of course one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the systems employed within and the functionality of core network depend on the wireless network type s that it supports.

In one embodiment a router interconnects cellular operator server farm to core network . Cellular operator server farm includes at least one server or other computing device implementing functionality associated with enabling and or facilitating operation of wireless network . For example cellular operator server farm in one embodiment comprises signaling gateway and Home Location Register HLR .

As shows in one embodiment cellular operator server farm includes subscriber database and identity access management functionality such as Identity Based Directory Access Protocol ID DAP server and an identity provider . Identity provider is operative to authenticate and assert a user s identity.

Mobile stations in one embodiment include browser client functionality such as micro browsers operative to receive data and files directly from servers such as application or media server indirectly via a WAP gateway or other proxy. As discussed above a variety of circuit switched or packet switched bearer services can be employed to connect mobile stations to WAP gateway. For example mobile stations may be configured to establish a dial up connection. In one embodiment mobile station is a smart phone providing digital voice service as well as web access via a micro browser. Mobile station may also be a wireless personal digital assistant including a micro browser. The micro browser may comply with one to a combination of wireless access protocols such as WAP HDML i mode cHTML and variants of any of the foregoing. In one embodiment at least one mobile station may include functionality supporting SMS and or MMS messaging. In yet another embodiment the mobile station may include a special purpose client that is configured to interact directly with application server as opposed to a general purpose micro browser. In one embodiment the mobile station may include a media player a gaming application or other client side application.

Subscribing to podcasts allows a user to collect programs from a variety of sources for listening or viewing either online or off line through a portable device as desired. Using known software tools such as Apple iTunes software podcast enabled RSS readers web browsers etc. podcasts or other multimedia files downloaded to computer can then be synchronized to a portable multimedia device such as an MP3 player for off line listening. The publish subscribe model of podcasting is a version of push technology in that the information provider chooses which files to offer in a feed and the subscriber chooses among available feed channels.

Podcasting technologies can involve automatic mechanisms by which multimedia computer files are transferred from a server to a client which pulls down XML files containing the Internet addresses of the media files. In general these files contain audio or video but also could be images text PDF or any file type. The content provider posts the feed to a known location on a web server such as podcast system server . This location is known as the feed URI or perhaps more often feed URL . A user enters this feed URI into a software program called a podcatcher podcast reader or aggregator executed on computer . This program retrieves and processes data from the feed URI. A podcatcher can be an always on program which starts when the computer is started and runs in the background. It manages a set of feed URIs added by the user and downloads each at a specified interval such as every two hours. If the feed data has substantively changed from when it was previously checked or if the feed was just added to the podcatcher s list the program determines the location of the most recent item and automatically downloads it to the user s computer . Some podcatchers such as iTunes also automatically make the newly downloaded episodes available to a user s portable media player. The downloaded episodes can then be played replayed or archived as with any other computer file.

The elements of hardware system are described in greater detail below. In particular network interface provides communication between hardware system and any of a wide range of networks such as an Ethernet e.g. IEEE 802.3 network etc. Mass storage provides permanent storage for the data and programming instructions to perform the above described functions implemented in the RF coverage map generator whereas system memory e.g. DRAM provides temporary storage for the data and programming instructions when executed by processor . I O ports are one or more serial and or parallel communication ports that provide communication between additional peripheral devices which may be coupled to hardware system .

Hardware system may include a variety of system architectures and various components of hardware system may be rearranged. For example cache may be on chip with processor . Alternatively cache and processor may be packed together as a processor module with processor being referred to as the processor core. Furthermore certain embodiments of the present invention may not require nor include all of the above components. For example the peripheral devices shown coupled to standard I O bus may couple to high performance I O bus . In addition in some embodiments only a single bus may exist with the components of hardware system being coupled to the single bus. Furthermore hardware system may include additional components such as additional processors storage devices or memories.

In particular embodiments the processes described herein are implemented as a series of software routines run by hardware system . These software routines comprise a plurality or series of instructions to be executed by a processor in a hardware system such as processor . Initially the series of instructions are stored on a storage device such as mass storage . However the series of instructions can be stored on any suitable storage medium such as a diskette CD ROM ROM EEPROM etc. Furthermore the series of instructions need not be stored locally and could be received from a remote storage device such as a server on a network via network communication interface . The instructions are copied from the storage device such as mass storage into memory and then accessed and executed by processor .

An operating system manages and controls the operation of hardware system including the input and output of data to and from software applications not shown . The operating system provides an interface between the software applications being executed on the system and the hardware components of the system. According to one embodiment of the present invention the operating system is the LINUX operating system. However the present invention may be used with other suitable operating systems such as the Windows 95 98 NT XP operating system available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. the Apple Macintosh Operating System available from Apple Computer Inc. of Cupertino Calif. UNIX operating systems and the like.

A scalable system has been developed that supports the dynamic insertion of advertisements into media communicated to remote hosts such as mobile devices and media players as well as other computing systems. In particular embodiments this system employs an insertion server as described above to perform this dynamic insertion. In turn such an insertion server might employ the processes described below. Some embodiments of this system use pre normalized media content to avoid transcoding and concurrent media streams to avoid the use of large amounts of temporary or intermediate storage.

With regard to pre normalized media particular embodiments require that ads be encoded in a format compatible with the targeted content. For instance if an ad is targeted for insertion into a video podcast then the system might required the ad to be encoded using the H.264 video codec the AAC audio codec and a frame rate of 15 fps. In other implementations the system itself may transcode the media after a user uploads it. Further when the target content comes in a variety of formats some embodiments might require that the ads be available in each of the target formats. Such availability can be achieved by pre transcoding the ad into each of the target formats using a high quality source file.

The use of a high quality source file lessens the degradation resulting from lossy codecs. Pre transcoding the ad allows the transcoding to take place long before any user requests are made for the content thereby avoiding any delays in the delivery of content with the inserted ad. Moreover ads are typically much shorter than the target content and therefore require many fewer resources to transcode in comparison with the resources which would be required to transcode both the ad and content together at insertion time.

In addition to pre normalizing with respect to compatibility particular embodiments of the system might require pre normalizing with respect to sequence. For example some container file formats do not require that their media samples to be in a linear sequence though such a sequence might be easier and faster to process. As part of the pre normalizing process an embodiment of the system might require the creation of a linear sequence of media samples. Since pre normalizing is non real time it does not detract from performance of the system. Other embodiments require pre normalizing with respect to compatibility but not with respect to sequence.

With regard to concurrent media streams it will be appreciated that a audio and video files tend to be large relative to text documents or images but b insertion of such files should not use large amounts of temporary storage space since the use of such storage scales poorly to handle a high volume of content requests. Therefore in some embodiments of the system the insertion server might manage input and output streams concurrently as shown in where at a general level the insertion process proceeds as follows i open Input Stream and read the header ii open Input Stream and read the header iii write the merged header to the Output Stream iv pipe the media data from Input Stream to the Output Stream and v pipe the media data from Input Stream to the Output Stream.

In this generalized process the input and output data sources might not be files on a local system. They might be network connections reading from media servers and writing to a remote client. Since the input and output streams are being read written at the same time the process does not need to create a temporary output file or use other temporary output storage. Further the amount of memory required to complete this process is relative to the size of the headers each of which tend to be extremely small relative to the media file size.

Further the generalized process in could be easily changed to work with more than two input sources in order to insert multiple ads. In this regard see below. Similarly this generalized process could be easily changed to allow the insertion of the ad into any position in the output stream rather than at the beginning or end of the content.

While the above generalized process might be applied to various media file formats the MP4 format facilitates the process due to the fact that it is a container format. shows a simplified view of a container format file such as an MP4 file. In the file might contain one or more tracks such as an audio track and a video track where each track has a header which describes the track in greater detail e.g. its duration encoding playback rate etc.

Further each track includes a table of pointers into the data portion of the file. The data items to which the pointers point are called chunks. There is no required ordering for the chunks but it is often the case that audio and video information is interlaced from beginning to end to allow the media to be played while the file is being read sequentially.

The sample table is the counterpart to the table of pointers into the data portion of the file shown in . Each entry in a sample table specifies the location and duration of a chunk of sample data such as a still image a video frame a sequence of PCM audio samples or a text string. There is at least one sample description for each table of samples. The sample description provides the details necessary to translate a stored sample into a format that a media handler can work with. For example a sample description might specify the height width and pixel format of an image or the sample size and sampling rate of a group of PCM audio samples.

Not shown in is the track s edit list which allows one to alter or reorder the display of data samples without changing or rearranging the samples themselves i.e. it enables nondestructive editing . Using an edit list one can edit out a track segment without deleting any samples from the data source or repeat a segment without increasing the size of the data source with duplicate samples. In other words any segment of media time including an empty segment can be mapped to any segment of track time. If a track has not been edited the edit list is empty and the track is treated as a single segment with all the media samples played in the order they are stored at the natural time scale for the media sample data. See the QuickTime Overview Apple 2005 Aug. 11 .

As noted in steps and the process pipes onto an output stream the media data from the source and target media streams. Particular embodiments implement this piping step with file channels that operate on temporary copies of the source and target media streams stored on the insertion server. File channels are a part of the so called new I O APIs application programming interfaces provided by the Java programming language. In the new I O APIs a file channel can establish a buffer directly mapped to file contents using memory mapped I O. See generally the section on New I O in the Java Platform Standard Edition 5.0 Development Kit JDK 5.0 Documentation Sun Microsystems 2004 .

Further in this regard shows a table from ISO IEC 14496 12 2005 E Corrected Version 2005 Oct. 1 the specification for the ISO base media file format which forms the basis for the MP4 container file format. The table provides descriptions of the atom or box types that are used in particular embodiments of the invention and shows the relationship between the types by way of an indentation hierarchy.

Returning to the first step of the process adjusts the duration in the stream header e.g. mvhd for the target media stream to account for the new media length i.e. ad plus content . In the second step and third steps and the process launches nested for loops that will iterate over each track in both the target media stream and the source media stream. In step the process adjusts the durations in the track header e.g. tkhd the edit lists e.g. elst and the media headers e.g. mdhd to account for the new media length. Then in step the process adjusts the sample count in the time to sample structure e.g. stts in the sample tables. In step the process adds the additional samples to the sync sample structure e.g. stss in the sample tables. And in step the process adjusts the sample to chunk structure e.g. stsc in the sample tables to account for the new samples. In step the process adds the new samples to the sample size structure e.g. stsz in the sample tables. Then in step the process adjusts the chunk offset structure e.g. stco in the sample tables to account for the additional media and adds the new chunks to the structure. In step the process recalculates the size of each track header edit list media header and sample table before both for loops end. And in step the process recalculates the total size of all the structural information including the adjusted stream header for the target media stream. Then in step the process readjusts the chunk to offset table based on the header recalculations.

As described above particular embodiments of the insertion process might be comprised of instructions that are stored on storage media. The instructions might be retrieved and executed by a processing system. The instructions are operational when executed by the processing system to direct the processing system to operate in accord with the present invention. Some examples of instructions are software program code firmware and microcode. Some examples of storage media are memory devices tape disks integrated circuits and servers. The term processing system refers to a single processing device or a group of inter operational processing devices. Some examples of processing devices are integrated circuits and logic circuitry. Those skilled in the art are familiar with instructions storage media and processing systems.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate variations of the above described embodiment that fall within the scope of the invention. In this regard it will be appreciated that there are many other possible orderings of the steps in the processes described above and many possible modularizations of those orderings. And it will be appreciated that the processes are equally applicable when a media stream has tracks in addition to a video track and an audio track.

Further it will be appreciated that there are other file formats besides MP4 to which the described insertion process might be applied including other container file formats. Some examples of other container file formats QuickTime the standard Apple container on which MP4 is based IFF first platform independent container format AVI the standard Microsoft Windows container also based on RIFF MOV standard QuickTime container Ogg standard container for Xiph.org codecs ASF standard container for Microsoft WMA and WMV RealMedia standard container for RealVideo and RealAudio Matroska not standard for any codec or system but it is an open standard 3gp used by many mobile phones and all file format that use the ISO base media file format. As a result the invention is not limited to the specific examples and illustrations discussed above but only by the following claims and their equivalents.
