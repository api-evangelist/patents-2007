Many particle detectors for detecting biological agent aerosols e.g. the Tier 3 Biological Aerosol Warning System are based on the fact that biological materials fluoresce when irradiated with ultraviolet radiation or light . Some conventional detectors have an optical cavity that defines a focal point within the optical cavity. The biological agent aerosol is directed at the focal point along with the ultraviolet light from an ultraviolet radiation or light emitter such as a laser or an LED and the ultraviolet light generates fluorescence from the biological agent aerosol at or near the focal point. However problems can occur when using light emitters e.g. semiconductor ultraviolet optical sources SUVOSs that have both a primary emission band with a center wavelength in the ultraviolet region i.e. a primary emission band that is capable of eliciting a fluorescence response from a biological aerosol and a secondary emission at longer wavelengths that overlaps and interferes with the fluorescence response. In particular the secondary emission band can be scattered by particles in the aerosol detector s optical cavity thereby creating a positive response signal in the aerosol detector regardless of whether the scattering particle was a biological molecule or not.

Filtering optics are sometimes located between the SUVOS and the focal point to attenuate radiation that is emitted in the secondary emission band. However such filtering optics can make the distance between the SUVOS and the focal point undesirably long for use in some particle detectors and thus can make these detectors undesirably large and difficult to transport. Another problem is that setting up the filtering optics is often difficult and time consuming.

A radiation source has a radiation emitter assembly disposed at least in part in a first compartment of a housing. A lens system is disposed in a second compartment of the housing so that the lens system is optically coupled to the radiation emitter assembly. A mirror is disposed in a third compartment of the housing so that the mirror is optically coupled to the lens system. A filter and a conduit are disposed in a fourth compartment of the housing so that the filter and an aperture provided by the conduit are optically coupled to the mirror. Radiation exits the radiation source through the aperture.

In the following detailed description of the present embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments that may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice disclosed subject matter and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that process changes may be made without departing from the scope of the claimed subject matter. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the claimed subject matter is defined only by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.

Radiation source includes a housing as shown in . An interior of housing with its contents removed is shown in . Note that a portion of housing is removed in . The removed portion is a minor image of the portion of housing shown in . The removed portion of housing abuts the portion of housing shown in at surface so that housing is symmetric about surface . For one embodiment the abutted portions of housing may be secured together by fasteners such as bolts or cap screws.

Radiation source also includes a radiation emitter assembly that is disposed in a compartment of housing . A lens system is disposed a compartment of housing . For one embodiment lens system has two or more lens elements positioned one after the other in series in the axial or longitudinal or z direction. A mirror e.g. a dichroic mirror is disposed in a compartment . A filter and a conduit are disposed in a compartment of housing so that conduit extends from an exterior of housing e.g. in a radial or r direction as shown in . Conduit provides an aperture through which radiation generated by radiation emitter assembly exits radiation source .

Note that for one embodiment the portion of housing that includes compartments and is a body of revolution about the z axis or the central longitudinal axis of housing and the portion of housing that includes compartment is a body of revolution about the radial or r direction and is thus substantially perpendicular to the portion of housing that includes compartments and . Compartment is formed between compartment and compartment and for one embodiment forms an angle e.g. about 45 degrees with the axial or z direction.

Respectively disposing radiation emitter assembly lens system mirror and filter and conduit in compartments and of housing positions radiation emitter assembly lens system mirror and filter and conduit at predetermined geometric locations with respect to each other so that radiation emitter assembly lens system mirror and filter and conduit are located at predetermined distances from each other and are optically aligned with little of no additional adjustment. In other words compartments and of housing and radiation emitter assembly lens system mirror and filter and conduit are configured to position radiation emitter assembly lens system mirror and filter and conduit at predetermined distances from each other and to optically align radiation emitter assembly lens system mirror and filter and conduit with little or no additional adjustment. This acts to reduce the time required for positioning and aligning radiation emitter assembly lens system mirror and filter and conduit .

For one embodiment radiation emitter assembly includes a radiation emitter attached to a substrate e.g. called a TO can e.g. of metal as shown in . Electrical leads are attached to radiation emitter for supplying power to the radiation emitter . For another embodiment substrate with radiation emitter disposed thereon is disposed on a base having lead outs through which the electrical leads pass as shown in . For another embodiment base is disposed within a holder e.g. by threading so that substrate is secured between base and holder as shown in . Holder includes an extension that extends radially inward away from axial walls of holder and toward a central longitudinal axis z or the center of radiation emitter assembly and thus toward the z axis of housing as shown in . Substrate is secured between base and extension when base is threaded into holder as shown in .

Base of radiation emitter assembly has radial extensions that extend radially outward away from the central longitudinal axis z as shown in for one embodiment. Extensions are received in slots formed in an interior surface of a wall of housing within compartment . Slots extend axially in a direction parallel to the z axis into compartment from an end of housing and terminate at ends thereof within compartment as shown in . The ends of slots abut radial extensions of base as shown in to prevent further axial insertion of radiation emitter assembly within compartment . When ends of slots abut radial extensions of base of radiation emitter assembly radiation emitter assembly and thus radiation emitter is at a predetermined distance from lens system as shown in .

Slots one of which is shown in are also formed in wall of housing within compartment . Note that the other slot is formed in the portion of housing that has been removed. For one embodiment slots are formed at 90 degrees in the angular or direction along the cylindrical surface of wall within compartment from slots as shown in . Slots extend axially into compartment from the end of housing and terminate at ends thereof within compartment as shown in . Note that the ends of slots are located at a longer axial distance from end of housing than the ends of slots . In other words the ends of slots are located at a shorter axial distance from compartment than the ends of slots as shown in .

The radial extensions of base of radiation emitter assembly can also be received in slots e.g. after rotating radiation emitter assembly by 90 degrees about its central longitudinal axis z from the position shown in . When ends of slots abut radial extensions of base radiation emitter assembly and thus radiation emitter is at a predetermined distance from lens system . Since the ends of slots are located at a longer axial distance from the end of housing than the ends of slots radiation emitter is located at a longer axial distance from the end of housing when radial extensions of base abut the ends of slots than when radial extensions of base abut the ends of slots .

Abutting the radial extensions of base of radiation emitter assembly at the end of slot and at the end of slot respectively sets the axial position of the radiation emitter at two different predetermined locations within housing . As discussed below the two different predetermined locations of radiation emitter are respectively used in conjunction with two different configurations of the lens system . The radial extensions of base of radiation emitter assembly are positioned in slot for an embodiment where lens system includes three lens elements e.g. so as to position radiation emitter adjacent lens element as shown in . For one embodiment lens system includes three lens elements lens elements for a radiation emitter that emits ultraviolet radiation with a nominal wavelength of about 280 nanometers.

The radial extensions of base of radiation emitter assembly are positioned in slots for an embodiment where lens system includes two lens elements e.g. lens elements and and a spacer e.g. that replaces lens element . In this configuration positioning the radial extensions of base of radiation emitter assembly in slots positions radiation emitter assembly so that radiation emitter assembly extends into compartment and into the spacer so that radiation emitter is adjacent lens element . For one embodiment lens system includes two lens elements for a radiation emitter that emits ultraviolet radiation with a nominal wavelength of about 345 nanometers.

The radial extensions of base also abut sidewalls of each of slots when inserted in slots as shown in or abut sidewalls of each of slots when inserted in slots . This sets the radial position of radiation emitter relative the z axis i.e. positions radiation emitter assembly so that its central longitudinal axis z is aligned with the z axis of housing as shown in . Therefore slots or slots in conjunction with the radial extensions of base of radiation emitter assembly act to position radiation emitter at a predetermined location within housing with little or no additional adjustment.

For one embodiment a threaded hole extends inward e.g. in the radial direction from the exterior of housing and opens into compartment as shown in . Hole aligns with holder of radiation emitter assembly when the radial extensions of base are located in slots or slots as shown in when the radial extensions of base are located in slots . For another embodiment a set screw not shown may be threaded into hole so as to engage holder to fix radiation emitter assembly in place.

Lens of lens element has a surface and a surface as shown in . Surfaces and are surfaces of revolution obtained from rotating the two dimensional shapes of surfaces and shown in about a central longitudinal axis z in an angular direction . For one embodiment radiation e.g. generated by radiation emitter enters lens at surface and exits lens at surface . Note that flange forms a container shaped structure around surface .

For one embodiment the two dimensional shape of surface at a fixed angular location is completely described by a pure fourth order curve in cylindrical coordinates r z as follows 0.530668 04 1 where z is the axis of rotation or central longitudinal axis of surfaces and and thus of lens and lens element . The curvature of the base sphere of surface is zero.

For one embodiment the two dimensional shape of surface at the angular location is completely described by an ellipse E r in combination with a fourth order curve as follows 0.178064 04 2 where curv 1 1 1 curv 3 where curv is the curvature of the base sphere of surface and is 0.09985863 and k is the conic constant and is 0.521838. Note the E r defines an ellipsoid of revolution when rotated about the z axis.

For one embodiment a notch is formed in an end surface of flange of lens element as shown in . For another embodiment end surface faces radiation emitter . An outer circumferential surface of flange located at an outer diameter Dof flange forms a radial boundary of notch as shown in . A radial surface connected between the outer circumferential surface and an outer circumferential surface located at an outer diameter Dof flange forms an axial boundary of notch as shown in .

For another embodiment an axial extension extends from an end surface of flange where end surface faces in a direction opposite to end surface as shown in . Axial extension has an end surface that is substantially parallel to end surface for one embodiment that faces in substantially the same direction as end surface and that is displaced axially from end surface in direction away from surface . An inner circumferential surface of flange located at an inner diameter Dof flange forms a radial boundary of axial extension as shown in .

For one embodiment outer circumferential surface has a flat region at the outer diameter D as shown in . Flat region extends over an axial distance zfrom radial surface to an axial location on outer circumferential surface as shown in . For another embodiment outer circumferential surface tapers inward toward the center of lens element starting at axial location and ending at end surface of axial extension . Specifically surface tapers inward toward the center of lens element at an angle e.g. of about one degree from a direction parallel to the z axis as shown in .

For one embodiment an inner circumferential surface of flange tapers outward away from the center of lens element starting at a base of surface and ending at end surface i.e. at an axial location where the inner diameter of flange is D as shown in . Specifically inner circumferential surface tapers outward away from the center of lens element at an angle e.g. of about three degrees from a direction parallel to the z axis. Note that end surface is connected between inner circumferential surface and inner circumferential surface as shown in .

The radial boundary of axial extension formed by the inner circumferential surface of flange contacts the radial boundary of notch formed by the outer circumferential surface of flange as shown in when axial extension of flange is received in notch of flange . Moreover end surface of axial extension abuts the axial boundary of notch formed by radial surface as shown in when axial extension of flange is received in notch of flange . Further end surface of flange abuts end surface of flange as shown in when axial extension of flange is received in notch of flange . For another embodiment the inner diameter D at which the inner circumferential surface occurs or the outer diameter D at which the outer circumferential surface occurs or both the inner diameter Dand the outer diameter Dmay be selected to produce a press fit between the inner circumferential surface and the outer circumferential surface so that inner circumferential surface and the outer circumferential surface are in forcible engagement.

For one embodiment the flat region of outer circumferential surface of flange of each lens element contacts an interior surface of wall of housing within compartment . This is illustrated for example for flange of lens element in where the flat region of outer circumferential surface of contacts an interior surface of wall of housing within compartment . Moreover the outer circumferential surface of each lens element tapers away from the interior surface of wall at the angle in the axial direction going away from radiation emitter starting at axial location and ending at end surface . This is illustrated for example for flange of lens element in where the outer circumferential surface tapers away from the interior surface of wall at the angle starting at axial location and ending at end surface .

As shown in connecting lens elements and in series as described above sets a predetermined axial distance zbetween the vertex of surface of lens of lens element and the vertex of surface of lens of lens element with little or no additional adjustments. Connecting lens elements and also aligns lens elements and so that their central longitudinal axes of z are aligned with each other as shown in with little or no additional adjustment.

As best shown in compartment is located between axial boundaries and . When lens system is disposed in compartment end surface of lens element abuts axial boundary and end surface of lens element abuts axial boundary as shown in . Disposing lens system in compartment and disposing radiation emitter assembly in compartment i.e. disposing radial extensions of radiation emitter assembly in either slots or of compartment sets the axial distance z between radiation emitter and the vertex of the surface of the lens element closest to radiation emitter with little or no additional adjustment. Disposing lens system in compartment so that the flat regions of the respective lens elements engage the interior surface of wall within compartment and disposing radiation emitter assembly in compartment also aligns the central longitudinal axes z of housing z of the lens elements and thus lens system and z of radiation emitter assembly as shown in .

Note that the subscript i in is a 1 one when three lens elements are used and the radial extensions of radiation emitter assembly are inserted into slots . Alternatively the subscript i in is a 2 two when two lens elements are used and the radial extensions of radiation emitter assembly are inserted into slots .

When two lens elements are used in conjunction with radial extensions disposed in slots lens element is replaced by a spacer as shown in according to another embodiment. For one embodiment spacer is a lens element with the lens removed and the flange remaining as shown in . For this embodiment spacer is connected to lens element in the same way as lens elements and are connected as described above in conjunction with . Note that radiation emitter is located within spacer which is the result of inserting the radial extensions of radiation emitter assembly into slots . Note further that a portion of radiation emitter assembly extends from compartment into compartment when radial extensions are disposed in slots so that radiation emitter is located in compartment .

For one embodiment radiation emitter is an ultraviolet radiation source in the form of a light emitting diode. For another embodiment radiation emitter may be a semiconductor ultraviolet optical source SUVOS in the form of a light emitting diode. Semiconductor ultraviolet optical sources typically emit radiation in both primary and secondary emission bands. The primary emission band has a center wavelength in the ultraviolet region that can be used to irradiate and optically excite biological molecules in an aerosol sample. The secondary emission band has a center wavelength in the visible spectrum and is generally an unintended and unwanted companion to the primary emission band for applications involving biological molecules since its spectrum sometimes and undesirably overlaps the expected fluorescence spectrum of biological molecules excited by radiation from the primary emission band.

For another embodiment radiation emitter emits a total amount of radiation over a total angle e.g. of about 178 degrees as shown in a ray diagram illustrating the operation of radiation source . For some embodiments the radiation emitted by radiation emitter has a numerical aperture of about 0.65 in object space. For other embodiments emission of radiation from radiation emitter is a Lambertian emission.

For one embodiment a surface of a lens that is directly exposed to the radiation from radiation source captures radiation emitted over an angle e.g. as shown in for surface of lens of lens element . Note that in one embodiment a surface of a lens may capture about 70 percent of the total amount of radiation emitted from radiation emitter . That is the radiation emitted over the angle in is about 70 percent of the total amount of radiation emitted over the total angle .

In the radiation emitted over the angle that is captured by surface of lens is contained between rays and . Radiation diverges by the angle away from the z axis i.e. away from the centers of lenses and which are coincident with the z axis until radiation reaches surface of lens . Radiation is refracted inward toward the z axis as it passes through surface so that radiation diverges by an angle which is less than the angle away from the z axis between surface and surface of lens . That is the refraction at surface reduces the divergence of radiation compared to the divergence before the refraction at surface . Radiation is refracted further inward toward the z axis as it passes through surface so that radiation diverges by an angle which is less than the angle away from the z axis between surface of lens and surface of lens . That is the refraction at surface reduces the divergence of radiation compared to the divergence before the refraction at surface .

Radiation is refracted further inward toward the z axis as it passes through surface of lens so that radiation diverges by an angle which is less than the angle away from the z axis between surface of lens and surface of lens . That is the refraction at surface reduces the divergence of radiation compared to the divergence before the refraction at surface . Radiation is refracted still further inward toward the z axis as it passes through surface so that radiation diverges by an angle which is less than the angle away from the z axis between surface of lens and surface of lens . That is the refraction at surface reduces the divergence of radiation compared to the divergence before the refraction at surface .

Radiation is refracted further inward toward the z axis as it passes through surface of lens so that radiation diverges by an angle which is less than the angle away from the z axis between surface of lens and surface of lens . That is the refraction at surface reduces the divergence of radiation compared to the divergence before the refraction at surface . Radiation is refracted still further inward toward the z axis as it passes through surface so that for one embodiment radiation converges by an angle toward the z axis between surface and mirror . That is for one embodiment the refraction at surface causes radiation to transition from diverging radiation to converging radiation. The transition from diverging radiation to converging radiation need not be limited to surface of lens but could occur at other lens surfaces within lens system .

Mirror is at the angle with respect to the z axis. Note that compartment which contains mirror is at the angle and that disposing mirror in compartment sets the angle of mirror to the angle with respect to the z axis with little of no additional adjustment. Mirror also forms an angle 90 degrees with respect to the r direction and thus lens system see . Note that when 45 degrees.

The converging radiation is generally axial or generally parallel to the z axis when converging radiation is received at mirror . Mirror reflects the converging radiation so that it is generally radial or generally parallel to the r axis e.g. when the angle is about 45 degrees as shown in . Note that for one embodiment a ray that is coincident with the z axis and thus coincident with the central axis of lens system and thus bisects the angles is reflected by about 90 degrees e.g. when the angle is about 45 degrees as shown in .

After radiation is reflected from mirror radiation continues to converge by the angle as it passes through filter conduit and aperture until it reaches its focal point as shown in . For one embodiment radiation converges to about a 1 millimeter by a 1 millimeter area at focal point . For another embodiment the focal length of radiation source is the axial distance zfrom radiation emitter to where the z axis intersects mirror plus the radial distance rfrom where the z axis intersects mirror to focal point as shown in . For one embodiment the just defined focal length of radiation source about 3 inches.

Inserting filter into compartment aligns filter with respect to mirror so that substantially all of the radiation reflected from mirror passes through filter as shown in with little or no additional adjustment. For one embodiment inserting filter into compartment aligns filter with respect to mirror so that ray is aligned with a central longitudinal axis of filter as shown in with little or no additional adjustment. Moreover inserting conduit into compartment positions aperture so that substantially all of the radiation reflected from mirror passes through aperture as shown in with little or no additional adjustment. For one embodiment inserting conduit into compartment positions aperture so that the ray is aligned with a central longitudinal axis of aperture as shown in with little or no additional adjustment.

For another embodiment mirror is a dichroic mirror that reflects ultraviolet radiation at a pre selected nominal wavelength within about 5 nanometers of the nominal wavelength and passes longer wavelengths as indicated by arrow of e.g. to a beam dump not shown . For example for embodiments where radiation emitter is a semiconductor ultraviolet optical source mirror reflects wavelengths of the primary emission band of the semiconductor ultraviolet optical source in the ultraviolet region and passes the longer wavelengths of the secondary emission band of the semiconductor ultraviolet optical source e.g. to the beam dump.

For one embodiment at least the portion of wall of housing within compartment that contains mirror may be of a material that is transparent to the longer wavelengths e.g. clear for wavelengths in the visible range passed by mirror . This enables the longer wavelengths to exit housing by passing through this portion of wall within compartment as indicated by arrow in . The exiting longer wavelengths may then be directed to the beam dump.

For another embodiment filter may be a short pass filter such as a black glass filter gray filter etc. that filters out any residual long wave radiation that did not get passed by mirror .

Detector also includes an optical cavity in accordance with the embodiments of the particle or biological aerosol detectors described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 967 338 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 268 758 both of which were incorporated by reference above. For one embodiment optical cavity is formed in part by a shell for an elliptical mirror . An aerosol sample drawn into optical cavity is excited by radiation that is provided by radiation source that focuses this radiation onto the inner focal point of elliptical mirror . For one embodiment the inner focal point of elliptical mirror coincides with the focal point of radiation source . The optical path from radiation source to the inner focal point of elliptical mirror defines an excitation beam axis .

As shown in for one embodiment detector includes first and second radiation sources placed at opposite ends of excitation beam axis . This configuration allows particles to be illuminated from two radiation sources thereby providing twice the excitation power of devices that use a single excitation assembly. In addition the wavelengths emitted by the first and second radiation sources may be different thereby allowing the detection of different biological aerosols or discrimination between detected aerosols.

The shell of elliptical mirror includes an inlet through which aerosol samples are drawn into the optical cavity formed by the housing. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 967 338 the biological aerosol detector shown in utilizes an opposing intake flow design that defines an aerosol sampling axis . The excitation beam axis is perpendicular to this aerosol sampling axis and both of these axes are perpendicular to a fluorescence detection axis that runs orthogonal to the top plan view of the detector that is shown in . A detector placed along fluorescence detection axis can detect the fluorescence radiation emitted by a biological molecule in the sampled aerosol that is excited by the ultraviolet radiation from the one or more radiation sources .

Embodiments of the disclosure provide a radiation source that provides a collimated beam of radiation e.g. ultraviolet radiation at a focal point. For one embodiment housing of radiation source has a plurality of compartments configured so that when their respective components are inserted therein the components are optically aligned with respect to each other and are positioned at predetermined distances from each other with little or no additional adjustment. This reduces the set up time required for positioning and aligning these components.

For example inserting radiation emitter assembly in compartment aligns its central longitudinal axis z with the central longitudinal axis z of housing as shown in with little or no additional adjustment. Inserting lens system in compartment sets the distance between radiation emitter assembly and lens system to a predetermined distance and aligns the central longitudinal axis z of lens system with the central longitudinal axis z of radiation emitter assembly and with the central longitudinal axis z of housing as shown in with little or no additional adjustment. Inserting mirror into compartment sets mirror at the predetermined angle with respect to lens system and sets the distance from lens system to mirror to a predetermined distance as shown in with little or no additional adjustment. Inserting filter into compartment aligns filter with mirror so that substantially all of the radiation reflected from mirror passes through filter as shown in with little or no additional adjustment. Inserting filter into compartment aligns filter with respect to mirror so that substantially all of the radiation reflected from mirror passes through filter as shown in with little or no additional adjustment. Inserting conduit into compartment positions aperture so that substantially all of the radiation reflected from mirror passes through aperture as shown in with little or no additional adjustment.
