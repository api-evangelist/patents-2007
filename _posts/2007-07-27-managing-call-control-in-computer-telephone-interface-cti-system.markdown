This application makes reference to incorporates the same herein and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. 119 from an application for APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MANAGING CALL CONTROL IN COMPUTER TELEPHONE INTERFACE SYSTEM earlier filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on 25 Aug. 2006 and there duly assigned Ser. No. 2006 81026.

The present invention relates to a method and apparatus to manage call control in a Computer Telephone Interface CTI system.

In typical telephone systems such as a keyphone and an exchange a Computer Telephone Interface CTI executes application software for providing functions including call processing automatic dialing automatic screen pop up and switching and calling number identification together with additional functions including voice storage and restore voice recognition and facsimile interfacing.

A link configuration of the CTI is suitable for simple applications supporting a small group of users and a single user and for complex applications requiring call tracking and transfer services for mid size or larger groups such as servers. Furthermore a CTI server shares computer resources such as functions or applications with other servers and is used in an environment including a Data Signal Processing DSP system for system architecture flexibility.

A CTI system builds a CTI driver on a computer for performing a telephone function using typical application software through a Computer Telephone Integration CTI Application Programming Interface API which supports the Telephony Application Programming Interface TAPI Telephony Standard application Programming Interface TSPI standard.

The operation of a CTI system including a computer terminal for transmitting and receiving a call control message to and from a wireless terminal by building such a CTI driver is described as follows.

Referring to the CTI system includes a computer terminal an exchange and a number of wireless terminals .

When a request to control the wireless terminal has been received from a user S the computer terminal calls a CTI command using a CTI command API in response to the request to control the input wireless terminal S .

The computer terminal then calls a CTI driver through an API function of the CTI command API S so that the CTI command is transmitted to the exchange via an exchange interface driver S .

The exchange receives the CTI command from the computer terminal via a computer interface S and parses the received CTI command using a parsing routine S .

The exchange confirms a terminal state information management routine from the parsed CTI command and recognizes a call control routine for the wireless terminal to be controlled S .

The exchange then calls a call control command routine for the call wireless terminal through the call control routine generates a call control command using a typical SIP or an internal protocol of the wireless terminal S and transmits the generated call control command to the wireless terminal via its wireless terminal interface S .

The wireless terminal receives the call control command from the exchange via its exchange interface S and parses the received call control command using a call control command parsing routine for the wireless terminal S .

As shown in when a user s request to effect voice communication with the computer terminal or to terminate ongoing voice communication has been received S the wireless terminal generates a wireless terminal call control event message through its call control function S .

The wireless terminal generates the call control event message using an SIP or an internal protocol of the exchange and the wireless terminal .

The wireless terminal transmits the generated call control event message to the exchange via its exchange interface S .

When the call control event message has been received from the wireless terminal via its wireless terminal interface S the exchange parses the received call control event message using an event parsing routine S and recognizes state information of the wireless terminal using a state information management routine for the wireless terminal S .

Recognizing the state information of the wireless terminal the exchange performs call control through a call control routine based on the recognized state information of the wireless terminal S .

The exchange generates a CTI event message in response to the call control event message from the wireless terminal S and transmits the generated CTI event message to the computer terminal via the computer interface S .

When the CTI event message is received from the exchange via the exchange interface driver S the computer terminal calls the CTI event API using the CTI driver S and finally processes the received CTI event message using the CTI event ATI S .

Since the CTI system needs to support a TAPI based CTI API to process messages transmitted and received between the computer terminal and the wireless terminal the CTI system must be fully built even for simply controlling the wireless terminal . This reduces economic efficiency and increases development and manufacturing costs.

The wireless terminal presets and store indexes defined according to the promise with the computer terminal and includes preset call control identification information before the index corresponding to each key value to generate the call control message.

As shown in when a call control command has been received from the user via a keypad user interface which is provided by a CTI application program S the computer terminal generates a call control message through a CTI application program in response to the call control command S and transmits it to the exchange S .

The call control message includes a call request message for a voice communication request a call termination message for a voice communication termination and the like. The computer terminal receives key values as the call control command via the keypad user interface converts each key value into a corresponding index and generates a call control message including each converted index.

The computer terminal includes call control identification information before each converted index so that the call control message is promptly transmitted to the wireless terminal via the exchange .

Upon receipt of the call control message from the computer terminal the exchange detects the call control identification information from the received call control message. When the call control identification information has been detected the exchange maintains the call control message generated by the computer terminal unchanged and interfaces it to the wireless terminal S .

When the call control message has been received from the exchange the wireless terminal recognizes the index included in the call control message and controls a function corresponding to the index in order to perform the function S .

Specifically when the recognized index is a call request index the wireless terminal signals the call request from the computer terminal to the user. When a call response key has been input from the user via the keypad in response to the signaling the wireless terminal performs a call connection with the computer terminal . On the other hand when the recognized index is a call termination index the wireless terminal terminates the call connection with the computer terminal and signals the call termination to the user.

As shown in the CTI system presets indexes corresponding to key values of the keypad provided by the CTI application program in the computer terminal and the keypad of the wireless terminal .
