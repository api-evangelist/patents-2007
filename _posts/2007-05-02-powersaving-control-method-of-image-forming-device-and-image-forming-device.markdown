title: Power-saving control method of image forming device, and image forming device
abstract: In a power-saving control method of an image forming device, the image forming device is set in a power saving state when an input operation is not performed by a user over a predetermined time. The image forming device in the power saving state is shifted to a minimum power state. Prior to shifting of the image forming device to the minimum power state, a filtering unit is activated to detect communication between an external device and the image forming device in the minimum power state. When a detected communication signal indicates an image formation request from the external device, the image forming device is caused to return from the minimum power state through the power saving state to a standby state so that the image forming device is ready for performing image formation.

Thus it is possible to provide the power saving control method and the image forming device which can increase the power saving effect further.

A description will be given of embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.

As shown in the image forming device is provided with a main control function unit which includes a controller which controls the whole image forming device .

A HDD hard disk drive is provided in the image forming device of as a storage device. The HDD is controlled by a HDD control unit through a driver .

A plotter engine and a scanner engine are provided as a unit which realizes the print function for printing an image and a unit which realizes the scan function for reading an image respectively. The plotter engine and the scanner engine are controlled by an engine control unit through a driver .

An operation panel which is used by a user is provided in the image forming device of . The operation panel is controlled by an operation panel control unit through a driver . The operation panel control unit is a control unit which realizes the control function of operations and displays on the operation panel .

The operation panel control unit communicates with the controller and transmits or receives information related to the displaying of the operation panel . Also the operation panel control unit communicates with the application A and the application B through a library and transmits or receives information related to the displaying of the operation panel .

The controller is a main control unit which controls the whole image forming device and this controller collectively carries out management of the power supply state of the HDD management of the power supply state of the HDD control unit and the engines and management of engine power saving state and control of the engines and .

The controller controls the state of the operation panel for displaying the operating state or the setting information of the image forming device to the user in accordance with the operating state of the application A or the application B and the operating state of the engines and and controls the state of the operation panel control unit which controls the operation panel .

A functional block of the image forming device which includes the above mentioned function units including the controller which control the various functions of the image forming device mentioned above is called the main control function unit .

The image forming device of is provided so that when an input operation is not performed by a user over a predetermined time or when a shifting request for shifting the image forming device to the power saving state is inputted by the user on the operation panel the image forming device is shifted to the minimum power state in which the power supply to the major control functions including the control function to stop the displaying of the operation panel the control function to stop the rotation of the polygon motor the control function to lower the fixing temperature the control function to inhibit operation of peripheral devices and the control function to reduce driving parts of the image forming device body such as motors is stopped in order to reduce the power consumption further.

In the image forming device of a filtering unit is provided to receive the power supply from another power source which is separate from the power source which supplies power to the main control function unit . An output terminal of the filtering unit is connected to the controller through a driver . The image forming device of is provided with a network interface unit such as NIC which is not illustrated and thus the image forming device is arranged to be connectable to an external device on a network such as LAN. An input terminal of the filtering unit which is not illustrated is connected to the network interface unit mentioned above. In this embodiment the filtering unit and the driver are set in an active state before the image forming device is shifted from the power saving state to the minimum power state.

Even in the minimum power state the filtering unit continuously receives the power supply and it is held in the active state. The filtering unit has a function to monitor communication between the image forming device and an external device at any time.

When a communication signal packet in a predetermined communication protocol entering the filtering unit is detected during the minimum power state the filtering unit notifies a return trigger for returning the image forming device from the minimum power state to a subsystem which is not illustrated provided in the image forming device .

When the above mentioned subsystem receives this return trigger and it is determined that the received trigger satisfies the predetermined return conditions the power supply to the controller and or the engine control unit is restarted through the control of a power supply control unit which will be mentioned later in order to return the image forming device from the minimum power state. Then the controller restarts the power supply to the HDD control unit and the operation panel control unit through the control of the power supply control unit.

A response monitoring task of the above mentioned subsystem determines the content IO port number of the communication signal packet detected by the filtering unit . In order to enable the image forming device to return from the minimum power state according to the result of the determination the controller receives a notice of return information from the response monitoring task and after this notice is received the controller causes the operating state of the image forming device to be shifted to the standby state so that the image forming device is ready for performing a printing operation.

The returning of the image forming device from the power saving state or the minimum power state is also performed when the response monitoring unit of the above mentioned subsystem detects an input operation which is performed on the operation panel of the image forming device by the user. This return processing procedure will be mentioned later.

After the image forming device of is returned from the power saving state the scanner engine converts into digital image information an image of a document read in response to a document reading request and transmits the image information to the controller . The controller receives the image information and stores the received image information in the HDD through the HDD control unit when accumulation or temporary saving of the received image is required. On the other hand when accumulation and temporary saving of the received image is not needed but printing of the received image is required the controller transmits the received image to the plotter engine so that a printing operation is sequentially performed.

As shown in the operating states of the image forming device of are classified into a standby state a low power state a power saving state and a minimum power state.

The standby state in is a normal operating state of the image forming device in which the image forming device is ready for performing an image formation operation for example a printing operation in response to a request received from the user. If a state transition factor F expiration of a timer count etc. or a state transition factor F a key operation by a user etc. occurs during the standby state the operating state of the image forming device is shifted to the low power state or the power saving state.

If a state transition factor F a key operation a network response etc. occurs during the low power state or the power saving state the operating state of the image forming device is returned to the standby state.

If the state transition factor F expiration of a timer count etc. occurs during the low power state the operating state of the image forming device is shifted to the low power saving state in which the power consumption is relatively low.

If the state transition factor F a key operation a network response etc. occurs during the power saving state the operating state of the image forming device is returned to the standby state. If a state transition factor F expiration of an internal timer count etc. occurs during the power saving state the operating state of the image forming device is shifted to the minimum power state in which the power consumption is still lower.

On the other hand if the state transition factor F a key operation a network response etc. occurs during the minimum power state the operating state of the image forming device is returned to the power saving state or to the standby state via the power saving state. In the case where the state transition factor F at this time is a printing request the operating state of the image forming device is returned from the minimum power state through the power saving state to the standby state so that the image forming device is ready for performing a printing operation.

An ASIC which is not illustrated in the image forming device of serves as the above mentioned subsystem which performs the control of the power supply for returning the image forming device from the minimum power state in association with the filtering unit and the driver .

The subsystem is held in the active state together with the filtering unit and the driver even in the minimum power state. In other words during the minimum power state the power supply to all the control units including the controller of the main control function unit except the power supply control unit of the subsystem which performs the control of the power supply and the response monitoring unit of the subsystem which performs the response monitoring to an external input such as an input operation by the user or an input received through the communication interface unit to which the external device is connected is stopped.

The above mentioned subsystem has a CPU provided therein. During the minimum power state the operation of the power supply control unit and the response monitoring unit of the above mentioned subsystem is controlled by the software implemented as a task on the OS operating system in the image forming device of .

For example the software of the above mentioned subsystem may include a power supply control task a communication driver task a filter task a USB response task an operation panel task an input output port task a timer task etc.

When the power switch of the image forming device is turned on the above mentioned subsystem is initiated and the respective tasks of the subsystem are initialized. During the minimum power state the above mentioned subsystem continuously receives the power supply and is held in the active state. The response monitoring unit continuously performs the response monitoring operation to the external input.

Therefore the tasks of the above mentioned subsystem monitor the corresponding portions of the ASIC during the minimum power state. When the result of the monitoring satisfies the return conditions the image forming device is caused to return from the minimum power state through the control of the power supply control unit.

A transition shifting procedure which is performed when the operating state of the image forming device of is shifted from the power saving state to the minimum power state and a return processing procedure which is performed when the operating state of the image forming device of is returned from the minimum power state to the power saving state will be described later with reference to and respectively.

When the user intends to perform a normal printing operation the user operates ten keys to set up the number of print copies. The user can operate print mode selection keys to select a desired detailed setting of operation. After this setting is performed the user presses a start key so that the corresponding application program starts running.

The information from the running application or the controller which indicates the operation situation at this time is displayed on a panel display or a banner display to the user. In order to change the application program the user may press a selected one of application change keys so that the current application program is switched to the selected application program. Between the application programs and the application change keys one to one correspondence is established.

When the image forming device is shifted to the power saving state a notice of the shifting is displayed to the user according to the transition state of the power saving.

The LED of the power saving key is lit to display the power saving transition state in which the image forming device is shifted to the power saving state. The power saving key has the function of the shift key for shifting to the power saving state.

Besides the power saving key the image forming device may be shifted to the power saving state when the time count of the timer in the controller exceeds a predetermined value or when the power key of the image forming device is pressed.

As shown in if the user opens the setting screen of the image forming device in the operation panel various kinds of setting items which can be set up by the user are displayed for every tag of various functions of the image forming device. If the user chooses the tag of power saving operation setting among the tags then the power saving operation setting screen appears on the operation panel .

The user can set up various kinds of setting of the power saving operation using this power saving setting screen . From a minimum power setup display part of the screen in the example of the user can set up an operation setting as to whether shifting of the image forming device from the power saving state to the minimum power state in which the power supply to the controller is further stopped is permitted or inhibited.

Moreover from a setting priority display part of the screen in the example of the user can set up an operation setting according to the need of the user as to whether the power saving priority setting is selected or the recovery time shortening setting to shorten the power saving recovery time by setting the connected external device in valid invalid state is selected.

For example when the connected external device is a wireless LAN device and the user wishes to give priority to operation of the wireless LAN device connected to the image forming device this wireless LAN device is set in valid state and the recovery time shortening setting is selected from the setting priority display part of the screen . In this case shifting of the image forming device from the power saving state to the minimum power state is not performed the image forming device is always caused to return directly from the power saving state and the power saving recovery time is shortened. Usually a certain amount of standby time is needed for the image forming device to return from the minimum power state via the power saving state after the power supply to the controller is stopped refer to .

Similarly when the connected external device is a USB device a USB memory or external printer the user can set up from the setting priority display part of the screen the operation setting according to the need of the user as to whether the power saving priority setting is selected or the recovery time shortening setting by setting the connected USB device in valid state is selected.

In the example of only the two kinds of operation setting the minimum power setup display part and the setting priority display part are illustrated. However the invention is not limited to this example. Alternatively operation setting concerning the power saving operation other than mentioned above may also be performed.

For example suppose that the image forming device is connected to a center system at a remote place via a communication network and the image forming device has the function to communicate with the center system periodically so that the center system performs remote maintenance service of the image forming device. In this case the user may set up an operation setting as to whether the power saving priority setting is selected or the maintenance service priority setting is selected.

The transition shifting procedure of is started when a shifting request for shifting the image forming device to the minimum power state arises in the image forming device in the power saving state. During the power saving state only the power supply to the controller is turned ON and the power supply to other function units of the main control function unit is turned OFF. The shifting request may include a case in which the power saving key is pressed by the user and a case in which a predetermined time is exceeded while the image forming device is not used by the user.

Upon start of the transition shifting procedure of the controller determines whether the user s operation setting is to permit the shifting of the image forming device to the minimum power state step .

The determination of step is based on whether the user previously selected from the minimum power setup display part of the operation setting to permit shifting of the image forming device from the power saving state to the minimum power state or not.

When the result of the determination of step is negative the shifting is inhibited the image forming device is never shifted to the minimum power state and the transition shifting procedure of is terminated immediately.

On the other hand when the result of the determination of step is affirmative the shifting is permitted the controller performs processing to check the configuration information of the image forming device and the state of the external device connected to the image forming device step .

Based on the result of checking of the configuration information of the image forming device and the state of the connected external device the controller determines whether shifting of the image forming device from the power saving state to the minimum power state in which the power supply to the controller is stopped further is possible step .

For example suppose the case in which the configuration information of the image forming device indicates that a certain device a wireless LAN device a USB device etc. which requires periodical communication with the exterior is connected to the image forming device . In this case even if the image forming device is shifted to the minimum power state it will be necessary to immediately return from the minimum power state via the power saving state.

If the shifting to the minimum power state should be permitted in this case it will become a factor which worsens the machine life of the image forming device because that device causes the image forming device to repeat periodically operations for shifting from the power saving state to the minimum power state and for returning from the minimum power state to the power saving state or the standby state conversely.

To avoid this it is desirable for this embodiment to give priority to the effect of maintaining the machine life of the image forming device over a long period of time rather than the effect of reduction of the power consumption by the shifting to the minimum power state. Therefore when a certain device a wireless LAN device a USB device etc. which requires periodical communication with the exterior is connected the result of the determination of step is considered as an operation setting which inhibits shifting of the image forming device to the minimum power state the shifting to the minimum power state is impossible .

When the result of the determination of step indicates that the shifting to the minimum power state is impossible the controller notifies the user of impossibility of the shifting to the minimum power condition step . And the transition shifting procedure of is terminated.

The method of notifying the user of the impossibility of the shifting to the minimum power condition in step may include a method of notifying a device administrator of the impossibility by e mail a method of outputting an alarm sound to receive attention from the user a method of displaying an alarm message on the screen of the operation panel etc. Thereby the user or the device administrator is able to take a necessary action to avoid the factor to make the shifting to the minimum power state impossible.

On the other hand when the result of the determination of step indicates that the shifting to the minimum power condition is possible the controller arbitrates the transition conditions for shifting to the minimum power state by comparison with the operating state of each program of the application layer or the service layer of the image forming device and determines whether the arbitration of the transition conditions is completed step .

For example suppose the case in which the application A is operating in the image forming device as a facsimile application program and sets up reservation of transmission of image data at the end of a sleep period of a given time. In this case it is necessary for the image forming device to defer the shifting to the minimum power state until the image data transmission by the application A is completed.

Thus the controller determines at step whether the arbitration of the transition conditions by comparison with the operating state of each program of the application layer or the service layer of the image forming device is completed. When the arbitration with the operating state of each program of the application layer or service layer of the image forming device is not yet completed the controller performs again the determination of step after a predetermined time. The above mentioned determination of step is repeated until the arbitration of the transition conditions is completed.

When the result of determination of step indicates that the arbitration of the transition conditions for shifting to the minimum power state is completed the controller sets the filtering unit and the driver to the active state activation and performs the preparation for shifting the image forming device to the minimum power state step .

Subsequently the image forming device is shifted from the power saving state to the minimum power state in which the power supply to the controller is stopped further while the filtering unit and the driver are set in the active state.

As mentioned above the subsystem of the image forming device in this state monitors and detects whether the state transition factor F of occurs in association with the filtering unit and the driver .

In the return processing procedure of if a communication signal packet in the predetermined communication protocol entering the filtering unit is detected during the minimum power state the filtering unit notifies a return trigger to the subsystem of the image forming device .

The subsystem receives the return trigger from the filtering unit step . The subsystem determines whether the return trigger received from the filtering unit is a return packet in the predetermined communication protocol which satisfies the return conditions from the minimum power state step .

When the result of the determination of step indicates that it is not a packet in the predetermined communication protocol the image forming device should not be returned from the minimum power state. In this case the return processing procedure of is terminated immediately.

On the other hand when the result of the determination of step indicates that it is a return packet in the predetermined communication protocol the subsystem determines whether the packet detected by the filtering unit includes an image formation request print event sent to the image forming device from an external device based on the IO port number obtained from the header of the packet step .

In this embodiment an IO port number in the image forming device assigned for the case where the packet detected by the filtering unit includes a print event is different from an IO port number assigned for the case where the detected packet includes another network event. Therefore the subsystem can carry out the determination of step based on the IO port number obtained from the header of the detected packet.

When the result of the determination of step indicates that the packet does not include a print event it is adequate to perform a responding operation network response to the packet only and it is not necessary to perform immediate image formation operation in the image forming device . Thus in this case the subsystem restarts the power supply to the controller turning the power supply ON . And the subsystem performs the return processing of the controller . After the return processing of the controller is performed the controller restarts the power supply to the engine control unit or the engines turning the power supply ON . And the controller performs the return processing of the engine control unit or the engines steps . Therefore the power consumption in this case can be reduced to a comparatively low level.

On the other hand when the result of the determination of step indicates that the packet includes a print event it is necessary to perform immediate image formation operation in the image forming device . In this case the subsystem restarts the power supply to the controller and the power supply to the engine control unit simultaneously turning the power supply ON . And the subsystem performs the return processing of the controller . After the return processing of the controller is performed the controller performs the return processing of the engine control unit or the engines steps . Therefore in this case while the time to arrive at the image formation permitted state is shortened comparatively the power consumption becomes comparatively high.

Subsequently the controller performs the return processing of the image forming device to a power saving condition according to the contents of the packet detected by the filtering unit step .

For example when the packet includes a print event the controller performs the return processing of the HDD control unit the operation panel control unit and the operation panel in this order so that the image forming device is returned to the standby state in which the image forming device is ready for performing a printing operation. After the return processing is completed the return processing procedure of is terminated.

As mentioned above when the user s input operation occurs on the operation panel of the image forming device in the minimum power state the above mentioned subsystem and the controller perform the return processing so that the image forming device is returned from the minimum power state.

The respective processing in the above mentioned embodiment may be realized by using a computer readable recording medium having program code stored thereon. When executed by a CPU provided in the image forming device of the invention the recording medium causes the CPU to perform the respective processing in the above mentioned embodiment. The recording medium may include FD CD ROM and DVD and the program code being stored on the recording medium may be offered by digital information transmitted via a network.

Provided in the image forming device of the above mentioned embodiment are a mechanism for shifting the image forming device from the power saving state in which the power supply to all function units in the main control function unit except the main control unit is stopped to the minimum power state in which the power supply to the main control unit is further stopped and a mechanism for detecting a return factor during the minimum power state and for returning the image forming device from the minimum power state to the power saving state upon detection of the return factor. Therefore it is possible to provide the power saving control method and the image forming device which can increase the power saving effect further.

In the above mentioned embodiment it is determined whether shifting of the image forming device to the minimum power state in which stops the power supply to the main control unit the controller is permitted based on the configuration information of the image forming device and the state of the external device connected. Therefore the image forming device can be maintained in the minimum power state as desired by the user without requiring the user to perform a detailed setting about power saving.

In the above mentioned embodiment the reception of an e mail containing an alarm message enables the user to know the impossibility of shifting of the image forming device to the minimum power state and this enables the user to take a necessary action to avoid the factor to make the shifting to the minimum power state impossible.

In the above mentioned embodiment an alarm message indicating the impossibility of shifting of the image forming device to the minimum power condition can be displayed on the operation panel to receive attention from the user and this enables the user to take a necessary action to avoid the factor to make the shifting to the minimum power state impossible.

In the above mentioned embodiment the user is able to set up an operation setting for permitting or inhibiting shifting of the image forming device to the minimum power state in which the power supply to the main control unit is stopped further and increased convenience can be provided for the user.

The present invention is not limited to the above described embodiments and variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The present application is based on and claims the benefit of priority of Japanese patent application No. 2006 135635 filed on May 15 2006 and Japanese patent application No. 2007 084986 filed on Mar. 28 2007 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
