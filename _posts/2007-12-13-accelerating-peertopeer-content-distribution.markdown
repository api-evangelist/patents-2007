abstract: The acceleration of peer-to-peer downloads of content files wherein a tracker performs a condition based peer selection that is dynamically adjustable. A further feature relates to the use of enhanced message scheme for communications. One embodiment is a system in a swarm having at least one origin seed capable of at least initially storing the content files with at least one tracker maintaining a list of peers wherein the tracker uses at least one dynamically adjusting peer selection algorithm to generate a condition based peer-list and provides the condition based peer-list to a requesting peer.
