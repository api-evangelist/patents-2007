Field Management FM is a simulation workflow through which predictive scenarios are carried out in order to assist in reservoir field development plans surface facility design and de bottlenecking uncertainty and sensitivity analysis and instantaneous or lifetime revenue optimization from a hydrocarbon reservoir field. The function of Field Management has been distributed among reservoir simulators and a controller that couples the reservoir simulators to surface facility network simulators. As a consequence of the relative isolation of these different simulators the Field Management plans and scenarios are generally tightly integrated to the specific simulators used in the workflow. However the Field Management function is independent of the brand of the simulators the details of the physics being modeled and the mathematical approaches used in these simulators. As a result an independent and unified FM Framework is needed and that independent and unified FM Framework is disclosed in this specification. The FM Framework disclosed in this specification is completely decoupled from surface facility network simulators and subsurface reservoir simulators. However the FM Framework includes one or more adaptors each adaptor having a corresponding open interface . As a result one or more of the surface or subsurface simulators and one or more external Field Management algorithms can be operatively coupled to the FM Framework via the open interface of an adaptor of the FM Framework for the purpose of performing Field Management functions. In this specification the Field Management FM function is performed by the FM Framework .

The method steps of Field Management FM that are practiced by the FM Framework of include or involve 1 Strategy which involves encapsulating a list of instructions and an optional balancing action one might construct several strategies to be executed at different times of a simulation run only one strategy is active at one time 2 Instruction which ties a list of actions to a triggering criterion Actions are executed in the attempt to meet the instruction s success criterion i.e. desired well group field operating condition and 3 Action which encapsulates commands resulting in modifications of one or more flow entities . There are two categories of Actions 3a a Topology Modifying Action which modifies the state of flow entities e.g. open a well close a completion interval or changes boundary conditions e.g. add a new flow rate constraint to a well and 3b Balancing Action which allocates rates e.g. by optimization surface network balancing or heuristic group control to existing flow entities without modifying any of the flow entities states.

If the balancing is required execute a balancing action step of .

Each of these properties of Portability and Flexibility and Extensibility which are associated with the FM Framework of will be discussed in the following paragraphs with reference to of the drawings.

The Portability of the FM Framework can be explained as follows. The FM Framework has a clearly defined interface for simulators surface and subsurface and external FM algorithms. Any black box simulator may become part of the Field Management FM system by simply adhering to the FM adaptor interface. The FM adaptor interface helps decouple mathematical modeling details from reservoir engineering concepts. This means that the Field Management FM strategies remain unchanged when the details of the underlying mathematical model changes.

Refer to and . In connection with the FM framework of is shown in greater detail in . In the open interface of the adaptors that are used to interface different surface network simulators and subsurface reservoir simulators to the FM Framework is illustrated in . In connection with the published structure details of the open interface associated with the adaptors of the FMReservoirMgr node of the FM Framework of are illustrated in . In connection with the published structure details of the open interface associated with the adaptors of the NetworkMgr node of the FM Framework of are illustrated in . In connection with the illustrates the concept that the underlying representation of a completion interval might change from one reservoir simulation model to another but the definition concept of the completion interval remains the same.

In referring initially to the FM Framework of further includes an FMReservoirMgr node a NetworkMgr node and a FieldManagement node operatively connected to the FMReservoirMgr node and the NetworkMgr node . The FieldManagement node is adapted for practicing the previously discussed steps of which represent a Field Management Strategy corresponding to a method for Field Management associated with the FM Framework of . The Field Management FM Framework of is completely decoupled from surface facility network simulators and subsurface reservoir simulators . However in the FM Framework has a clearly defined open interface for simulators and any other external Field Management FM algorithms. The open interface and in represents an interface for the reservoir simulators and and the open interface and in represents an interface for the network simulators and . In any black box simulator or algorithm may become a part of the FM Framework system by simply adhering to the open interface of the adaptors associated with the FM Framework .

In the FM Framework includes adaptors and an open interface associated with the adaptors wherein other simulators such as reservoir simulators and or a network simulators can operatively attach to the FM Framework via the open interface of the adaptors . As shown in the adaptors within the FM framework are designed to hide the specific details of the reservoir network simulators so that the FM Framework can communicate with these reservoir network simulators in a generic way. The defined Field Management open interface in allows plug and play architecture for different reservoir network simulators with different brands capabilities and mathematical formulations. This is achieved by publishing only the engineering concepts associated with the open interface of of the adaptors 

In the published engineering concepts associated with the open interface of the adaptors are illustrated in detail.

In a set of published interface characteristics or engineering concepts associated specifically with the open interface with the adaptors of the FMReservoirMgr node of the FM Framework of are illustrated. The reservoir simulators of can interface directly with the FM Framework by adhering to the published interface characteristics of associated with the open interface of the adaptors of the FMReservoirMgr node of the FM Framework of .

In a set of published interface characteristics or engineering concepts associated with the open interface with the adaptors of the NetworkMgr node of the FM Framework of are illustrated. The network simulators of can interface directly with the FM Framework by adhering to the published interface characteristics of associated with the open interface of the adaptors of the NetworkMgr node of the FM Framework of .

The FM open interface as shown in enables more than just plug and play architecture. The FM open interface in helps to decouple mathematical concepts from reservoir engineering concepts thereby allowing the engineer to think only in terms of what matters most for the FM strategy that is what is real for example wells completion intervals fluid streams etc are real rather than simulation tools including finite difference grids and well segments which are used to represent what is real . For example refer to wherein the underlying representation of a completion interval might change from one reservoir simulation model to another but the definition concept of the completion interval remains the same.

Referring to an illustration of the Portability of the FM Framework is shown in the steps and of . The term Portability here refers to the ability of any reservoir simulator or network simulator to interface with the FM Framework via the open interface and of the adaptors and as shown in . In assume that a company X has its own reservoir simulator and they want to use the FM Framework in to build their field production strategies step in . The FM Framework of has a very well defined open interface and to the reservoir and network simulators and step in . As a result the engineers from company X can using the published information pertaining to the open interface and of i.e. the aforementioned engineering concepts of the open interface build an adaptor on their own and take full advantage of the FM Framework of step of .

The Flexibility of the FM Framework can be explained as follows. The FM Framework enables the user to control the settings of Field Management FM strategies allowing for a flexible system that handles conventional cases as well as complicated use cases. That is the FM Framework allows control over how the FM Framework logic is executed in order to accommodate real field situations that require such control. The FM Framework flexibility is demonstrated through control of the frequency at which the balancing action is executed a use by the FM framework of a set of expressions and a use by the FM framework of dynamic lists of flow entities.

Referring to and the FM Framework of is built upon a tree structure of nodes the tree structure of nodes associated with the FM Framework being shown in and to be discussed later in this specification . Part of each of the nodes of the FM Framework of is auto generated for example the managers are auto generated such as the ExpressionMgr the EntityListMgr etc and another part of each of the nodes of the FM Framework of is a created node that are case dependent. Under these managers including the StrategyMgr nodes can be created e.g. a strategy under the StrategyMgr an action under the ActionMgr etc .

In the StrategyMgr node is operatively connected to a BuildingBlocks node a Strategy1 node and a Strategy2 node . The BuildingBlocks node is operatively connected to the following additional nodes the ExpressioMgr node the BalancingMgr node the EntityListMgr node the InstructionMgr node the ActionMgr node and the ResourceMgr node .

In the FluidSystem node is operatively connected to the following nodes the FluidMgr node the SeparatorMgr node the FluidStreamSourceMgr node the FluidStreamMgr the CompositionalDelumperMgr node and the BlackOilDelumperMgr node .

In the further plurality of additional nodes which are operatively connected to the FluidStream1 node include the Ingredient1 node and the Ingredient2 node . In the further plurality of additional nodes which are operatively connected to the FluidStream2 node include the Ingredient1 node and the Ingredient2 nodes .

Referring to and the Flexibility of the FM Framework of is provided at several levels of the FM Framework 

In an illustration of the Flexibility of the FM Framework of reflects the frequency at which a balancing action is executed. Referring back to the steps of representing a Field Management Strategy corresponding to a method for Field Management associated with the FM Framework in the following steps represent the Flexibility of the FM Framework in terms of the frequency at which a balancing action is executed 1 One of the strategy s instructions consists on choking back wells to reduce the fluid flow velocity in all wells tubing to keep it below the erosional velocity step of 2 Choking back the well takes place incrementally so that a well is not choked back more than needed step of 3 Choking back one or more than one well impacts the fluid flow in the surface facility network step of 4 Solving the surface facility network model is basically needed after every single incremental choking in any well which might be prohibitively expensive in terms of CPU time step in and 5 Depending on the speed accuracy requirements the FM framework provides the engineer the options to balance the surface facility network balancing action at any of the following levels 5a After every single incremental choking back of any well at every reservoir simulator s Newton iteration 5b After choking back the well to have its velocity below the limit given the current flow conditions of the well at every reservoir simulator s Newton iteration 5c After choking back all wells to have them obey the erosional velocity limit at every reservoir simulator s Newton iteration 5d Just at the beginning of every time step and 5e Just every two months or any number of days step of .

The Extensibility of the FM Framework can be explained as follows. Custom variables custom actions and custom strategies enable the construction of extensions to the FM Framework . These extensions enable almost every conceivable use case to be handled by the FM Framework . These extensions may be made at run time on the user s platform without the need for a development cycle and additional software or hardware other than that provide through the Field Management FM system. These extensions may then be saved and reused for application to multiple cases.

Referring to and the Extensibility of the FM Framework of is provided at several levels of the FM Framework 

These extensibility points enable users to incorporate customized workflows at run time without having to go through any lengthy development cycle and without needing access to and have an intricate understanding of the underlying software and hardware.

The FM Framework of disclosed in this specification is intended for an audience of Field Management FM units in oil companies and service companies. The FM Framework disclosed herein is involved in the following workflows 

Field management FM is the simulation workflow through which predictive scenarios are carried out to assist in field development plans surface facility design de bottlenecking uncertainty sensitivity analysis and instantaneous lifetime revenue optimization from a hydrocarbon field. This involves among others the usage of reservoir simulators of surface network simulators of process modeling simulators and economics packages.

This specification discloses a comprehensive portable flexible and extensible FM framework which is completely decoupled from surface and subsurface simulators. The framework has a clearly defined interface for simulators and external FM algorithms. Any black box simulator or algorithm may become a part of the system by simply adhering to the FM interface as discussed in this specification.

The FM framework capabilities discussed in this specification are demonstrated on several examples involving diversified production strategies and multiple surface subsurface simulators. One real field case that requires advanced complicated development logic is also presented.

As noted earlier Field management FM is the simulation workflow through which predictive scenarios are carried out to assist in field development plans surface facility design de bottlenecking uncertainty sensitivity analysis and instantaneous lifetime revenue optimization from a hydrocarbon field.

Traditionally the FM functionality has been distributed among the reservoir simulator s the network simulator s and the controller that couples reservoir simulators to surface facility network simulators.The reservoir simulator provides embedded management tools for its subordinate wells. In the case of multiple reservoirs and surface facility networks the controller manages the boundary conditions exchange needed to couple different models and potentially tops up with some global management tools that account for the coupling of the different models. The different models involved in the coupled scheme might have substantially different FM capabilities and approaches. Potential overlap and conflict might arise between the local single reservoir management tools and the global FM tools.

As a consequence of the relative isolation of the different simulators the resulting FM plans scenarios are generally suboptimal and tightly integrated to the specific simulators used in the workflow.

Furthermore since the FM functionality is basically independent of the simulators brand the details of the physics being modeled and the mathematical approaches utilized in these simulators the usage of independent and unified FM framework provides a new horizon of powerful tools enabling the emerging smart field workflows.

This specification presents a comprehensive set of tools algorithms and frameworks referred to with FM or FM framework in the following parts of this specification enabling a management of the functionality required by most conventional fields.

Extensibility and flexibility of Field Management FM also allow s workflows and logic that are difficult impossible to implement within the prescribed set of functionality traditionally provided in reservoir FM tools. This specification presents an innovative approach for extensibility and flexibility providing many previously unavailable possibilities for advanced FM users.

Referring to Field Management FM comprises executing at a prescribed frequency i.e. solution method a strategy as depicted in . The terminology used in this section is fully described in following sections. Here we illustrate the overall picture of the FM framework presented in this specification.

Referring to the FM framework functionality is built upon a tree structure of nodes . shows the high level part of this structure. The nodes in the tree structure are fully described in the following sections.

Referring to one main node in is the strategy manager as illustrated in . shows an auto generated part of nodes the managers e.g. ExpressionMgr EntityListMgr etc and created nodes that are case dependent . Under these managers including the StrategyMgr nodes can be created e.g. a strategy under the StrategyMgr an action under the ActionMgr etc .

However the gained computational speed in the case of periodic solution is generally at the expense of accuracy. This is especially true in the case of 

In the following we present the different building blocks involved in an FM strategy. More basic building blocks are presented first.

Some of the above flow entities encapsulate other entities in other words they contain a lists of other entities 

Flow entities are one of the building blocks of an expression as described later on in this specification.

Most of the actions within the FM framework act on flow entity lists as detailed in this specification to meet an instruction s success criterion. There are three main types of flow entity lists 

A group is a collection of wells and or groups. Group hierarchies may also be built representing real hierarchies in the field e.g. representing manifolds or virtual hierarchies e.g. best performing wells . Groups may be overlapping i.e. one well group may be under multiple groups. Group level injection stream hierarchies may also be associated with groups.

Members of these lists do not change in time unless explicitly modified. Static flow entity lists may contain any type of flow entities including other static flow entity lists.

Membership and order of dynamic flow entity lists are reevaluated whenever the list is used. This means that the members of a dynamic list might change over time as field conditions change. Example of dynamic flow entity lists 

Dynamic flow entity lists may also be nested within each other in other words one dynamic list may provide the initial list of another dynamic list. There are no limits to the level of nesting. Nested dynamic lists enable the construction of lists such as 

All properties e.g. production oil rate reservoir volume gas injection rate bottom hole pressure etc. may be used to create numerical or logical expressions. States may also be used to create logical expressions. Examples of states that might be used in building expressions 

There are also several functions that may be used in expressions sum mean harmonic mean skewness standard deviation etc. . These functions will be executed at the point where the expression is evaluated. This allows flexible expressions that may be used to construct useful dynamic lists such as the list of wells that produce below the field average or in expressions used as triggering criteria.

These are expressions that are tied to one or more flow entities. Assigned expressions can be numerical when evaluated results in a real number or logical when evaluated results in a Boolean . Assigned expressions may be combined with other assigned expressions to form nested expressions. The following are some usage examples of assigned logical expressions 

Free expressions are not assigned to a flow entity. They must be assigned to a flow entity before they may be evaluated. These can be numerical or logical. The following are some usage examples of free expressions 

Actions are the FM components that encapsulate a logic that generates one or more primitive commands that modify the system. Actions are divided into two main categories 

It is also possible to encapsulate an instruction in an action hence enabling composite actions with their own triggering success criteria and nested instructions. Modifying existing instructions is also enabled through a specific instruction modifying action. It is also possible to extend the list of available actions at run time by way of custom actions as discussed later in this specification.

The instruction attempts to fix a success criterion by applying a list of actions. Fixing the success criterion means making it evaluate to True.

The success criterion is a logical expression assigned to one or more flow entities. Most of the time the criterion that triggers an instruction is what is being fixed. For instance if the trigger criterion is the field water rate is greater or equal to 5000 the instruction is deemed successful when the applied actions bring the field water rate below 5000. In other words the success criterion corresponding to a triggering criterion is most often the logical negation of the triggering criterion. However this is not always the case one might want to have a success criterion independent of the triggering criterion. For instance instead of working over wells in the field to obey the water rate limit of 5000 STB D one might want to bring it down to 4000 STB D so that the water rate will not exceed 5000 STB D in the next time step requiring yet another workover such frequent workovers may not be practical . Furthermore the success criterion might contain conditions that do not necessarily exist in the trigger criterion. If no trigger criterion is specified then the instruction will be executed unconditionally.

The actions in the action list are executed in the order they are defined. The instruction will cease executing actions as soon as the success criterion of the instruction evaluates to True. Note that the check for success is done with a prescribed frequency after every single topology modifying command for instance .

Every instruction has a balancing action that may or may not be the same as the strategy s balancing action. Here again the instruction s balancing action is executed with a prescribed frequency. Ideally the balancing action should be executed after every topology modifying command. However that might be computationally very expensive e.g. in the case of network balancing . A compromise would be to balance after every action in the instruction s list of actions or after the last executed action where the success criterion of the instruction is met .

One may optionally set instructions to be executed a second time within the strategy s instruction list in case later instructions have disturbed the instruction s success criterion. One may also set an instruction to be executed a single time in which case it will be removed from the strategy s list of instruction once executed e.g. a re tube action instruction may be allowed only once .

Executing the instruction s list of actions might fail to meet the instruction s success criterion. In such a case one may set an instruction to be reverted so that all actions are undone. Undoing actions is carried out as follows 

Balancing is an important concept in FM. It consists of allocating well flow rates so that limits targets that are specified on wells or lists of wells e.g. groups are obeyed met. Balancing does not involve opening closing wells and or completion intervals it rather adjusts well flow rates. In practice results of a balancing could be implemented by adjusting the wells choke settings and without installing any additional equipment.

A field wide balancing action may be applied at the FM strategy level. This causes all instructions in the strategy to use this balancing action. The balancing action is executed once at the beginning of the strategy execution loop and potentially after every topology modifying action as discussed above.

Strategy is the focal point of the FM framework. A strategy encapsulates a list of instructions and an optional field wide balancing action. The instructions are executed in the order they are specified.

The general approach in FM is that the desired field operating targets and limits on the whole field sets of wells reservoir regions completion intervals etc are honored by a combination of a field balancing action and topology modifying actions.

Balancing actions work within the potentials of the wells. When these potentials are not within the desired ranges balancing actions may not be able to honor some of the targets. Also when there are targets and limits there may come a point where the reservoir well properties become unfavourable e.g. wells with high WCT such that the target and limit cannot be satisfied simultaneously. In these cases topology modifying actions could be used to increase field well potentials e.g. drill new wells and or reduce unfavourable reservoir well properties e.g. workover high WCT .

This makes practical sense in most cases why resort to drastic and expensive measures like drilling wells when we are able to operate within the desired targets and limits with the current hardware i.e. topology installed in the field When the current hardware fails to honor all the desired targets and limits i.e. the balancing action fails to honor some of the targets limits we resort to topology modifying actions in the form of instructions that have topology modifying actions in their action lists .

Here is a simple demonstration of the proposed general approach. Suppose we would like to operate the field with the following target and limits 

We could set up a balancing action that would provide us the well by well allocation that honors all these desired field operating conditions. However there might come a point in simulation time when the model is no longer able to deliver 20000 STB D of oil with the existing wells. In this case we would need to drill new wells we could easily set up an instruction to do this.

Similarly even when there are enough wells in the model to deliver the oil target there might not be a well by well allocation that produced 20000 STB D of oil and less than 12500 STB D of water at the same time. This might easily happen if all the wells in the model have high WCT perhaps due to aquifer encroachment or injection water breaking through. To fix this situation one could easily set up an instruction to shut wells with high WCT or alternatively workover the completion intervals with high WCT.

Procedures provide a simple way of defining simple FM operations. They automatically set up expressions dynamic flow entity lists actions and instructions requiring minimal user provided information and relying on reasonable defaults. Procedures are very much like wizards found in some applications in this case the procedures are tailored for FM. The user may choose to override the default settings of a procedure or modify what has been set up.

Procedures provide high level FM workflows. Constraint handling procedures are one instance. Some example applications of constraint handling procedures are 

The procedure s role is to modify the system in order to obey a well or a group constraint. This can be achieved through several methods including 

The procedure s main product is an instruction for which the success criterion corresponds to the constraint being obeyed.

Referring to illustrates an overall view of PVT related part fluid system of the FM Framework that is the FM framework for PVT related functionality. In a fluid models manager and separators manager provide the fundamentals of the PVT calculations and fluid needs. Any fluid requirement in FM e.g. gas injection re injection fuel sale etc. needs to be provided through fluid stream sources that are ingredients to build fluid streams. Furthermore the FM framework provides the capability of converting fluid streams from coupled models with different fluid descriptions into a unified set of components.

Fluid streams manage the fluid requirements in FM. Examples of fluid requirements fuel gas sale gas and gas injection re injection.

Referring to this illustrates the structure details of the fluid streams functionality of the FM Framework . In a fluid stream consists of one or more fluid stream ingredients. It has a target rate that may or may not be met according to the ingredients availability as depicted in . A fluid stream ingredient uses a fluid stream source as shown in . It has a target rate fraction from a predefined fluid stream. One or more fluid stream ingredients might use the same fluid stream source. For instance both fuel gas and re injected gas streams might consist of ingredients sharing the same fluid stream source e.g. the gas from the second separator stage at the FIELD group .

Fluid streams have priorities. In the case of multiple fluid streams with limited fluid availability from their corresponding fluid stream sources the higher priority streams will be served first.

Inject 100 MMscf D of gas in group G. Use the following fluid stream ingredients in the prescribed order to make up the stream s target rate. Some of the ingredients may not be needed to make up the rate.

Inject 100 MMscf D of gas in group G. The gas is provided from the following fluid stream ingredients 

FM might be set to use any prescribed fluid description. The reservoir and network models might be using different fluid descriptions. An on the fly lumping delumping functionality converts when needed a fluid stream from one model to another e.g. delumping a blackoil stream from a reservoir model to the FM set of 11 components and pseudo components . Details of lumping delumping in the context of FM with multiple reservoirs coupled to surface facility networks are discussed in Ref below.

Referring to and referring initially to adaptors within the FM Framework are layers to hide the specific details of reservoir network simulators so that FM communicates with these simulators in a generic way. The defined FM interface allows plug and play architecture for different reservoir network simulators with different brands capabilities and mathematical formulations. This is achieved by publishing only the engineering concepts associated with the FM interface see for the published engineering concepts associated with the FM interface .

The FM interface enables more than just plug and play architecture. It helps decouple mathematical concepts from reservoir engineering concepts allowing the engineer to think only in terms of what matters most for the FM strategy in other words what is real e.g. wells completion intervals fluid streams etc rather than simulation tools used to represent what is real e.g. finite difference grids well segments etc .

Referring to a reservoir simulator adaptor to the FM framework is an interface that hides all the simulation details of wells or completion intervals and exposes only engineering relevant concepts of these entities. A tree structure of a reservoir simulator s adaptor is presented in .

A reservoir engineer that uses the reservoir simulation model using as opposed to constructing the model to carry out predictive scenarios might not be interested in the underlying mathematical details. For instance the number of cells in the finite difference model is irrelevant from the FM point of view. Similarly the details of grid cell to well node connections concern only the constructor of the model and not the user. The user of the model is concerned only with the engineering concepts e.g. completion intervals .

Decoupling mathematical and implementation specific details from purely engineering concepts has numerous advantages. Consider the implementation specific concept of grid cell to well node connections for a finite difference reservoir simulator and the engineering concept of completion intervals. A completion interval is defined universally by the following information 

In the case of a finite difference based reservoir simulator with a specific well model the reservoir simulator is coupled to the well model through grid cell to well node connections. These mathematical details of how a well node is connected to a grid cell are irrelevant for a reservoir engineer who wants to use the reservoir simulation model to investigate the following 

In the FM framework the reservoir engineer implements his her FM intentions FM strategy through the FM interface that is purely based on engineering concepts. Changes to the reservoir simulation model might occur in time for instance as new data comes in or when new computational power becomes available 

Referring to the definition of a completion interval however remains the same as illustrated in therefore the reservoir engineer s implementation of the FM strategy remains exactly the same. This is true even for more radical changes to the simulation model such as 

The same principle applies to the other concepts presented in the FM framework such as wells and fluid streams.

Referring to similar to a reservoir simulator adaptor a surface network model adaptor provides an interface that is independent of the specifics of the network simulator. This enables the usage control of different surface network models e.g. of different brands with the same FM strategy. A tree structure of a surface network simulator s adaptor is presented in .

FM can control multiple reservoir surface simulators in a session. These simulators may have the same or different brands they may run on the same or different machines and they may operate on the same or different operating systems OS . Despite this heterogeneity in the simulator brands OS etc. the system looks like an integrated system to the reservoir engineer. The software logistics that make this possible are hidden away in the adaptors enabling the reservoir engineer to focus on what is most important for her his task.

The presentation of an integrated system enables the reservoir engineer to define the FM strategy that encompasses multiple models. For instance one could easily construct an optimization problem that allocates rates across several reservoir models or a workover process that utilizes the same rig across completion intervals in wells defined in different simulators.

These extensibility points are implemented in the form of a free form python script. Python is an interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1990. Python is fully dynamically typed and uses automatic memory management. It also has strong object oriented capabilities. Python is developed as an open source project managed by the non profit Python Software Foundation and is available for free.

The python scripts used within the FM framework extensibility points have access to all the python language functionality and the standard libraries that comes with python. Naturally the basic language functionality of arithmetics conditionals loops functions classes and modules are available. The standard python libraries provide further functionality encompassing a wide range of topics from simple file to complicated remoting frameworks mathematical toolboxes etc. In addition an FM toolbox that provides reservoir engineering specific algorithms and tools is made available. The custom python script also has access to all the entities that are defined in all the coupled models wells groups surface network nodes etc .

These extensibility points pave the way for all kinds of real case and research implementations the possibilities are endless. These extensibility points are discussed below with some potential example applications.

Once created the custom variables may be used in expressions that in turn may be used as success criteria objectives constraints etc. The following are examples of the usage of custom variables 

Custom actions are another extensibility point of the FM framework. They might be potentially used for the implementation of complex and customized FM processes that cannot be implemented with the provided actions in the FM framework. Similarly to the other extensibility points custom actions are implemented in the form of a free form python script. The following are examples of the usage of custom actions 

The custom strategy is another level of the extensibility features of the FM framework. The custom strategy can be used when an advanced user wishes to circumvent the provided FM framework altogether and implement their own FM logic by way of free form python scripts. The following are examples of the usage of custom strategies 

FM provides the capability of interaction with the simulator in real time. In other words once the model has initialized and is ready to time step the reservoir engineer may query rates and pressures form the wells and completion intervals change states of flow entities construct groups etc. all in real simulation time. The reservoir engineer may also construct optimization or heuristic group control allocation problems even complete FM strategies and see their effects at once. The reservoir engineer may also instruct the simulators to time step to a target time and then resume the dynamic interaction.

The basic means of dynamically interacting with simulators in FM is through the python interpreter. The python interpreter provides an environment that is very similar to that of MATLAB. A MATLAB like environment with calculation and plotting capabilities coupled with live queriable reservoir simulators opens the door for many new potential applications. Some potential usages of dynamic interaction with the simulators are 

In the following sections we present three examples including a field case illustrating some of the capabilities of the FM framework presented in this paper. These examples are run using three reservoir simulator brands 

This example serves as a validation of the current framework. The results obtained with the presented FM framework are compared to previously published results.In Ref. 2 part of the FM logic is incorporated in the reservoir simulator and the other part in a controller . In the current paper the entire FM logic is unified in the FM framework.

Referring to a black oil reservoir model is coupled to a network model at the tubing head see . Three wells are initially open PA PB and PC one well from each platform . The remaining wells are placed in a drilling queue to be opened as needed in a prescribed order to keep the overall oil production rate above 10 000 STB D.

The instructions incorporating A I gets triggered whenever the field production rate falls below the prescribed target. The instructions incorporating A I and A I have no triggering criteria. All flow entities meeting the selection criteria of corresponding dynamic flow entity lists get processed. Whenever one of these three instructions is executed Action A gets applied since any of the modifications done by these actions require in principal the network to be balanced. The balancing action A is incorporated in a separate instruction I .

The set of instructions is executed in the following order at the beginning of each time step I I I and then I. The time step is restricted to a maximum of 30 days.

Referring to and details of this example s results are provided in Ref. 2. Here we briefly describe the results for completeness. presents the field oil rate vs. time. Whenever the oil rate falls below the prescribed target a new well is brought up to production. As shown in this figure only three wells are open at the beginning. These three wells get shut at the end of the third production year because of their WCT hitting the economic limit applied using action A. Wells have initially higher potential than what is shown in this figure. However the initial EVR of these wells risers is higher than the prescribed tolerance. Therefore the choke diameter at the well tubing head is dynamically decremented 0.25 inch each decrement to decrease the flow rate through these pipes in order to bring the erosional velocity ratio within tolerance. depicts the well head choke diameter for different wells. The resulting erosional velocity ratio vs. production time for these wells is shown in . shows the field s reservoir volume production rate as well as the reservoir volume water injection rate as applied by the heuristic group control action A.

Referring to the desired operating conditions are illustrated in . Note that most of these constraints are related to each other. In other words changing the well rates to meet one of these operating conditions affects one or more of the rest of the operating criteria. For instance if we changed gas injection rate of an injector well in Block B to meet the 100 voidage replacement constraint within that block we would also be changing the gas re injection percentage of the field.

The currently operational reservoir model utilizes the conventional if then logic of conditions and actions in the effort to bring the operating conditions of the model to the desired state. The conventional logic has 15 sequential steps 

The ad hoc constants a and b used in this sequential logic were determined by several sensitivity runs made to find out the magnitudes of reservoir volumes producible from and injectable into the reservoir. It is not easy to come up with the values of these constants that result in the best allocation for the field. In addition this sequential approach is not suitable for handling the inter dependencies of the constraints. These 15 steps lead to a suboptimal solution and not all constraints are met.

Alternatively this problem may be posed as an optimization problem. Problem setup becomes much easier and we no longer need the sensitivity runs and the ad hoc constants making the simulation workflow much more straightforward. The desired field operating conditions are met by employing a field allocation optimization algorithm based on Mixed Integer Programming. The optimization problem is defined by the following objective and constraints 

The allocation resulting from this optimization system satisfies all these constraints hence results in the desired operating strategy.

Referring to the 95 gas re injection constraint cannot be met with the conventional sequential logic while it is honoured perfectly with the optimizer as can be seen in . The 95 re injection constraint cannot be honoured by the conventional logic because the sequential approach is not able to accurately capture and evaluate the dependencies of the operating constraints imposed by the reservoir engineer.

The sequential logic results in a gas re injection percentage of about 111 . This means that 11 more gas is injected than is being produced. However in reality there is no source of external gas hence the results of the sequential logic does not reflect the actual situation in the field. Moreover since the model injects more gas than is actually available the rates and the pressures in the prediction diverge from reality as the simulation progresses. The optimized allocation has none of these restrictions.

This example demonstrates the extensibility of the FM framework. A user input prediction of oil prices in the future will be used as a weighing factor of oil production rate within the objective of an optimization problem that is set up to maximize the cash flow obtained from the field at a given time.

All the functionality except the means to define a customized oil price prediction is available in the Field Management framework. To add this extra functionality the reservoir engineer sets up f t in the form of a time versus oil price table and creates a custom variable in the form of a function that returns the value of the oil price and takes the simulation time as the argument. The engineer then uses this custom variable within the objective expression. This setup will basically result in an optimization problem with a changing objective based on f t being solved at every time step. All of this is done at run time on the user s platform without the need for the vendor to add this additional functionality through a lengthy development cycle.

Referring to the case is a simple synthetic case with four producers and one water injector. At every timestep the optimizer finds the optimal allocation that maximizes the cash flow and also honors the operating constraints. The resulting rates profile is given in . The oil price predictions used and the optimized cash flow are given in .

Refer now to . These illustrate the ultimate purpose of the above referenced method for Field Management including the Field Management Framework illustrated in that is adapted to be coupled to and decoupled from the reservoir and network simulators via the open interface of the adaptors of the FM Framework for integrated optimization of reservoir field development and planning and operation that is to extract oil and or gas from an Earth formation. illustrates the characteristics of the Earth formation and illustrates a drilling rig that can be used for extracting the oil and or gas from the Earth formation of .

In a first horizon H and a second horizon H are intersected by the fault surface . Now that the fault surface has been defined it is necessary to interpret a well log output record and the reduced seismic data output record to define the precise location of the underground deposits of hydrocarbon in an Earth formation. For example in the fault surface cuts through the first horizon and the second horizon in the Earth formation. A line represents a separation between oil and water the oil and water existing on one side of the fault surface . Rock and porous material exists on the other side of the fault surface . The fault surface intersects the horizons H and H at two places a first intersection and a second intersection . From it is evident that oil usually exists near the intersections and between the fault surface and the horizons H and H . In order to extract the oil from the Earth formation it is necessary to drill near the first intersection at point .

Referring to recalling from that it would be necessary to drill near the first intersection at point in order to extract the oil from the Earth formation a drilling rig can be placed on the Earth s surface directly above the point of for the purpose of extracting the oil from the Earth formation.

In an example of that drilling rig is illustrated. The drilling rig is situated above a particular location in the Earth formation that is above the point in the Earth s formation of where the oil and or gas is potentially located. In one embodiment of the drilling rig includes a surface system a downhole system and a surface control unit . In the illustrated embodiment a borehole is formed by rotary drilling in a manner that is well known. Those of ordinary skill in the art given the benefit of this disclosure will appreciate however that the present invention also finds application in drilling applications other than conventional rotary drilling e.g. mud motor based directional drilling and is not limited to land based rigs. The downhole system includes a drill string suspended within the borehole with a drill bit at its lower end. The surface system includes the land based platform and derrick assembly positioned over the borehole penetrating a subsurface formation . The assembly includes a rotary table kelly hook and rotary swivel . The drill string is rotated by the rotary table energized by means not shown which engages the kelly at the upper end of the drill string. The drill string is suspended from a hook attached to a traveling block also not shown through the kelly and a rotary swivel which permits rotation of the drill string relative to the hook. The surface system further includes drilling fluid or mud stored in a pit formed at the well site. A pump delivers the drilling fluid to the interior of the drill string via a port in the swivel inducing the drilling fluid to flow downwardly through the drill string as indicated by the directional arrow . The drilling fluid exits the drill string via ports in the drill bit and then circulates upwardly through the region between the outside of the drill string and the wall of the borehole called the annulus as indicated by the directional arrows . In this manner the drilling fluid lubricates the drill bit and carries formation cuttings up to the surface as it is returned to the pit for recirculation. The drill string further includes a bottom hole assembly BHA generally referred to as near the drill bit in other words within several drill collar lengths from the drill bit . The bottom hole assembly includes capabilities for measuring processing and storing information as well as communicating with the surface. The BHA further includes drill collars and for performing various other measurement functions. Drill collar of BHA includes an apparatus for determining and communicating one or more properties of the formation surrounding borehole such as formation resistivity or conductivity natural radiation density gamma ray or neutron and pore pressure. Drill collar houses a measurement while drilling MWD tool. The MWD tool further includes an apparatus for generating electrical power to the downhole system. While a mud pulse system is depicted with a generator powered by the flow of the drilling fluid that flows through the drill string and the MWD drill collar other power and or battery systems may be employed. Sensors are located about the wellsite to collect data preferably in real time concerning the operation of the wellsite as well as conditions at the wellsite. For example monitors such as cameras may be provided to provide pictures of the operation. Surface sensors or gauges are disposed about the surface systems to provide information about the surface unit such as standpipe pressure hookload depth surface torque rotary rpm among others. Downhole sensors or gauges are disposed about the drilling tool and or wellbore to provide information about downhole conditions such as wellbore pressure weight on bit torque on bit direction inclination collar rpm tool temperature annular temperature and toolface among others. The information collected by the sensors and cameras is conveyed to the surface system the downhole system and or the surface control unit. The MWD tool includes a communication subassembly that communicates with the surface system. The communication subassembly is adapted to send signals to and receive signals from the surface using mud pulse telemetry. The communication subassembly may include for example a transmitter that generates a signal such as an acoustic or electromagnetic signal which is representative of the measured drilling parameters. The generated signal is received at the surface by transducers represented by reference numeral that convert the received acoustical signals to electronic signals for further processing storage encryption and use according to conventional methods and systems. Communication between the downhole and surface systems is depicted as being mud pulse telemetry such as the one described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 517 464 assigned to the assignee of the present invention. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that a variety of telemetry systems may be employed such as wired drill pipe electromagnetic or other known telemetry systems.

In an explosive or acoustic energy source situated below the surface of the earth detonates and generates a plurality of sound or acoustic vibrations which propagate downwardly and reflect off a horizon layer within the Earth formation . The horizon layer could be a top layer of rock or sand or shale. When the sound vibrations reflect off the horizon layer the sound vibrations will propagate upwardly and will be received in a plurality of receivers called geophones situated at the surface of the earth. The plurality of geophones will each generate an electrical signal in response to the receipt of a sound vibration therein and a plurality of electrical signals will be generated from the geophones the plurality of signals referred to as received seismic data being received in a recording truck .

A functional description of the operation of the FM Framework of will be set forth in the following paragraphs with reference to of the drawings.

As noted earlier Field management FM is a simulation workflow involving the generation of predictive scenarios in order to assist in field development plans surface facility design de bottlenecking uncertainty sensitivity analysis and instantaneous or lifetime revenue optimization from a hydrocarbon field. The generation of these predictive scenarios during the FM simulation workflow involve among others the usage of reservoir simulators of surface network simulators of process modeling simulators and economics packages. The computer system of will generate these predictive scenarios by executing the FM simulation workflow software including the FM Framework that is stored in the memory of the computer system of in response to the input data . The input data is shown in the input data being generated as shown in . The Recorder or Display Device of the computer system of will record or display these predictive scenarios . When these predictive scenarios are generated by the computer system of a drilling rig similar to the drilling rig shown in FIG. can attempt to extract the oil and or gas and or other hydrocarbons from the Earth formation. An example of the Earth formation is shown in .

The function of Field Management has been distributed among reservoir simulators and a controller that couples the reservoir simulators to surface facility network simulators.

In this specification an independent and unified FM Framework of is disclosed which is completely decoupled from surface facility network simulators and subsurface reservoir simulators as shown in . The FM Framework of represents the FM simulation workflow software that is stored in the memory of the computer system of .

However even though the FM Framework of is completely decoupled from surface facility network simulators and subsurface reservoir simulators the FM Framework is Portable and as a result the surface facility network simulators and the subsurface reservoir simulators can be subsequently re coupled to the FM Framework . The FM Framework is Portable because it has a clearly defined adaptor interface for simulators surface and subsurface and external FM algorithms. Any black box simulator may become part of the Field Management FM system by simply adhering to the FM adaptor interface . The FM adaptor interface helps decouple mathematical modeling details from reservoir engineering concepts. This means that the Field Management FM strategies remain unchanged when the details of the underlying mathematical model changes. In particular the FM Framework of is Portable because the FM Framework includes one or more adaptors each adaptor having a corresponding open interface . As a result one or more of the surface or subsurface simulators of and one or more external Field Management algorithms can be operatively coupled to the FM Framework via the open interface of an adaptor of the FM Framework for the purpose of performing Field Management functions. The simulators of can be operatively coupled to the FM Framework by adhering to the published interface characteristics of associated with the open interface of the adaptors of the FMReservoirMgr node of the FM Framework of . The simulators of can be operatively coupled to the FM Framework by adhering to the published interface characteristics of associated with the open interface of the adaptors of the NetworkMgr node of the FM Framework of .

When the one or more of the surface and or subsurface simulators of and or the one or more external Field Management algorithms are operatively coupled to the FM Framework of via the open interface of the adaptors of the FM Framework in the manner described above for the purpose of performing Field Management functions the following steps of representing a Field Management Strategy associated with a method for Field Management can be practiced by the FM Framework of checking if execution of a Field Management FM strategy is needed step in . If execution of the FM strategy is needed in response to the checking step checking if there is any balancing action in the strategy. If there is a balancing action execute the balancing action step in . Then determine if there is an instruction in the FM strategy s list of instructions step of . If there is an instruction in the FM strategy s list of instructions determine if a triggering criterion of the instruction is met step of . If the triggering criterion of the instruction is met determine if a success criterion of the instruction is met step of . If the success criterion of the instruction is not met determine if there are any actions in the instruction s list of actions step of . If there are actions in the instruction s list of actions executing the actions step of a Field Management Strategy being executed when the actions are executed. In response to the step of executing the actions determine if the actions modified a topology in a predetermined manner such that balancing i.e. executing the balancing action is required step of . If the balancing is required perform a balancing action step of .

In addition to Portability the FM Framework of is also Flexible . The FM Framework is Flexible because it enables the user to control the settings of Field Management FM strategies allowing for a flexible system that handles conventional cases as well as complicated use cases. That is the FM Framework allows control over how the FM Framework logic is executed in order to accommodate real field situations that require such control. The FM Framework flexibility is demonstrated through control of the frequency at which the balancing action is executed a use by the FM framework of a set of expressions and a use by the FM framework of dynamic lists of flow entities. The Flexibility of the FM Framework is illustrated by the following examples.

In an illustration of the Flexibility of the FM Framework of reflects the frequency at which a balancing action is executed by the FM Framework . Referring back to the steps of representing a Field Management Strategy corresponding to a method for Field Management associated with the FM Framework in the following steps represent the Flexibility of the FM Framework in terms of the frequency at which a balancing action is executed 1 One of the strategy s instructions consists on choking back wells to reduce the fluid flow velocity in all wells tubing to keep it below the erosional velocity step of 2 Choking back the well takes place incrementally so that a well is not choked back more than needed step of 3 Choking back one or more than one well impacts the fluid flow in the surface facility network step of 4 Solving the surface facility network model is basically needed after every single incremental choking in any well which might be prohibitively expensive in terms of CPU time step in and 5 Depending on the speed accuracy requirements the FM framework provides the engineer the options to balance the surface facility network balancing action at any of the following levels 5a After every single incremental choking back of any well at every reservoir simulator s Newton iteration 5b After choking back the well to have its velocity below the limit given the current flow conditions of the well at every reservoir simulator s Newton iteration 5c After choking back all wells to have them obey the erosional velocity limit at every reservoir simulator s Newton iteration Just at the beginning of every time step and 5e Just every two months or any number of days step of .

In addition to Portability and Flexiblity the FM Framework of is also Extensible . The FM Framework is Extensible because of its use of custom variables custom actions and custom strategies. Custom variables custom actions and custom strategies enable the construction of extensions to the FM Framework . These extensions enable almost every conceivable use case to be handled by the FM Framework . These extensions may be made at run time on the user s platform without the need for a development cycle and additional software or hardware other than that provide through the Field Management FM system. These extensions may then be saved and reused for application to multiple cases. The Extensibility of the FM Framework is illustrated by the following examples.
