title: Automatic disambiguation based on a reference resource
abstract: A novel system for automatically indicating the specific identity of ambiguous named entities is provided. An automatic disambiguation data collection is created using a reference resource. Explicit named entities are catalogued from the reference resource, together with various abbreviated, alternative, and casual ways of referring to the named entities. Entity indicators, such as labels and context indicators associated with the named entities in the reference resource, are also catalogued. The automatic disambiguation collection can then be used as a basis for evaluating ambiguous references to named entities in text content provided in different applications. The content surrounding the ambiguous reference may be compared with the entity indicators to find a good match, indicating that the named entity associated with the matching entity indicators is the intended identity of the ambiguous reference, which can be automatically provided to a user.

The ability to identify named entities such as people and locations within a document has been established as an important task in areas such as topic detection and tracking machine translation and information retrieval. A user may perform a search of the Web or another resource for a particular person place or other specific entity by entering a string of text characters that constitutes an orthographic representation of a common name for the entity as a query in a search engine. However this string of text may also refer to other unrelated entities or meanings that are irrelevant to the intended search results while many relevant references may use other variations on the orthographic representation of the entity and thereby be missed by the search engine given the particular string of text. For example a search based on the string of text George W. Bush might return results that instead reference the earlier American president George H. W. Bush or George Bush International Airport in Houston the aircraft carrier George H. W. Bush other famous people places or entities with Bush in their name or to a literal bush or shrub as a category of plant. A search may also miss alternate surface forms or alternate orthographic references to the same intended entity such as a reference with an abbreviated alternate casual or other context specific form of the name of the intended entity. For instance alternate surface forms for George W. Bush that are used in various documents available on the Web may include President Bush Bush 43 or even an orthographically unrelated term such as Dubya . Other Web available references might reference Ronald Reagan as The Gipper or Abraham Lincoln as Honest Abe . Any of these documents might contain valuable information that would be desirable to include in search results for a search for the respective entities but may be missed using a search for a string of text that represents the standard surface form for representing the respective entities. It would therefore be highly desirable to identify text references to particular named entities consistently with all the various surface forms in which such references may occur.

While the intended entity for an ambiguous surface form might be quite clear to many informed readers due to context in some instances for example Bush delivered his State of the Union address to Congress many other instances may be more ambiguous e.g. Bush delivered the commencement address at the university . In the latter example the surface form Bush may actually refer to former president George H. W. Bush or to former Florida governor Jeb Bush for example and readers unfamiliar with the event covered would not be able to resolve it correctly. In addition with text content distributed around the world on the Internet it is to be expected that many readers of any content might be from backgrounds that do not dispose them to understand the entire context that a writer would take for granted. An effective way to provide explicit disambiguation of ambiguous surface forms for specific entities would therefore fulfill a broad and persistent need.

The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A novel system for automatically indicating the specific identity of ambiguous named entity mentions is provided. An automatic disambiguation data collection may be created using a reference resource. Explicit named entities may be catalogued from the reference resource together with various abbreviated alternative and casual ways of referring to the named entities. Entity indicators such as labels and or context indicators associated with the named entities in the reference resource may also be catalogued. The automatic disambiguation collection may then be used as a basis for evaluating ambiguous references to named entities in text content provided in different applications. The content surrounding the ambiguous reference may be compared with the entity indicators to find a good match indicating that the named entity associated with the matching entity indicators is the intended identity of the ambiguous reference which may be automatically provided to a user. A computing device may therefore provide unambiguous indications of the particular named entity referred to by potentially ambiguous surface forms in various documents.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in the background.

Software system is enabled to disambiguate a polysemic surface form and associate an entity to it from among different named entities such as persons places institutions specific objects or events or are otherwise referred to with proper names. Named entities are often referred to with a variety of surface forms which may for example be made up of abbreviated alternative and casual ways of referring to the named entities. One surface form may also refer to very different entities. For example different instances of the surface form Java may be annotated with different entity disambiguations to refer to Java island Java programming language Java coffee etc. in one exemplary embodiment. A user interested in gaining information about the island of Java will therefore be able to reliably and easily home in on only those references that actually refer to the island of Java in this example. Any document may be interpreted as a collection of references to particular named entities so that the named entities can be dealt with directly for navigating and using the information contained in the documents. For example a user selection of a surface form may lead to a Web search a news search or a search of an indexed collection of documents for the entity indicated by the surface form in different embodiments.

For example in the illustrative embodiment of reference surface form record is for the surface form Columbia as indicated at the record s title . The surface form Columbia is associated in reference surface form record with a variety of named entities that might be referred to by the surface form Columbia an illustrative sample of which are depicted in . These include Colombia nation which has a minor difference in spelling but often an identical pronunciation to surface form Columbia University the Columbia River a hypothetical company called the Columbia Rocket Company the Space Shuttle Columbia the USS Columbia and a variety of other named entities. The variation in spelling between Columbia and Colombia is another example of different surface forms that may represent the same named entity for example a Web search for Bogota Columbia returns a large fraction about one third as many search results as a Web search for Bogota Colombia .

Reference named entity record illustrates one example of a reference named entity in named entity reference database that may be pointed to by one of the named entities associated with reference surface form record . Reference named entity record is for the named entity Space Shuttle Columbia and is associated with a variety of entity indicators. The entity indicators include labels and context indicators in this illustrative embodiment. The labels illustratively include crewed spacecraft space program fatalities space shuttles and space shuttle missions while the context indicators illustratively include NASA Kennedy Space Center orbital fleet Columbia Accident Investigation Board Spacelab and Hubble Service Mission in the embodiment of . The labels and context indicators are used as bases for comparison with a text in which an ambiguous surface form appears to evaluate what named entity is intended by the surface form and are explained in additional detail below. The particular labels and context indicators depicted in are provided only as illustrative examples while any other appropriate entity indicators might be associated with the reference named entity Space Shuttle Columbia and any of a variety of other named entities may be associated with the surface form Columbia . Additionally other reference surface forms may also be used with their associated named entities and with the appropriate entity indicators associated with those reference named entities.

In one illustrative embodiment a user may use a pointer to indicate or select a surface form such as by manipulating a mouse or trackball to move pointer in position over a surface form such as by clicking on the surface form or merely by hovering the pointer over the surface form in different embodiments. illustrates the pointer being used in several different positions in a text to select surface forms and for which a disambiguation system respectively provides disambiguation outputs and . As particular illustrative examples surface form for Astro is disambiguated to mean the named entity the Astro 2 Ultraviolet Mission surface form for Columbia is disambiguated to mean the named entity the Space Shuttle Columbia surface form for Columbia is disambiguated to mean the named entity Columbia University the differing disambiguations of the same surface form is elaborated on further below surface form for Cape Canaveral is disambiguated to mean the named entity Launch Complex near Cape Canaveral and surface form for Florida is disambiguated to mean the named entity for Florida U.S. state as opposed for example to a reference to the University of Florida. These illustrative disambiguation outputs are provided by a disambiguation system illustratively such as software system of and displayed near the pointer for each of the selected surface forms.

For example when surface form Columbia is selected the disambiguation system provides a disambiguation output which reads Space Shuttle Columbia referring to the specific surface form and named entity illustratively depicted in the reference surface form record and the reference named entity record in . This and the other particular surface forms and named entities depicted in are illustrative only and any other reference to a named entity in any kind of text including a language input in another form of media that is converted into text may be acted on by a disambiguation system to provide disambiguation outputs for polysemic surface forms and explicit annotations identifying the entities intended to be referenced by various surface forms.

How the disambiguation system works to provide the disambiguation outputs and respectively for the selected surface forms and according to one illustrative embodiment is depicted in reference to an illustrative method in .

According to the illustrative embodiment of procedure illustratively includes step of extracting a set of surface forms and entity indicators associated with a plurality of named entities from one or more information resources. Procedure may further include step of storing the surface forms and named entities in a surface form reference comprising a data collection of surface form records indexed by the surface forms and indicating the named entities associated with each of the surface forms. Procedure may also include step of storing the named entities and entity indicators in a named entity reference comprising a data collection of named entity records indexed by the named entities and containing the entity indicators associated with each of the named entities.

Procedure includes step of identifying a surface form of a named entity in a text wherein the surface form is associated in a surface form reference with one or more reference named entities and each of the reference named entities is associated in a named entity reference with one or more entity indicators.

Procedure further includes step of evaluating one or more measures of correlation among one or more of the entity indicators and the text step of identifying one of the reference named entities for which the associated entity indicators have a relatively high correlation to the text where a correlation may be relatively high if it is higher than a correlation with at least one alternative for example and step of providing a disambiguation output that indicates the identified reference named entity to be associated with the surface form of the named entity in the text. Step may include using labels alone context indicators alone both labels and context indicators other entity indicators or any combination of the above as the entity indicators used for evaluating correlation. The disambiguation process therefore uses the data associated with the known surface forms identified in the information resource and any of a wide variety of possible entity disambiguations in the information resource to promote the capacity for automatic indications of high correlation between information from a text that mentions a surface form of a named entity and the labels and context indicators stored in a named entity reference for that named entity so that the reference to it in the document can be easily automatically reliably disambiguated.

Different embodiments may use different particular steps for any part of procedure and are not limited to the particular examples provided in connection with . The illustrative steps depicted in are elaborated on below.

Referring again to step the information resources used for extracting the reference surface forms and entity indicators associated with named entities may include a variety of reference sources such as an electronic encyclopedia a web publication a website or related group of websites a directory an atlas or a citation index for example. Different embodiments may use any combination of these information resources and are not limited to these examples but may also include any other type of information resource.

For example in one illustrative embodiment an electronic encyclopedia may be used as an information resource from which to extract the information referred to in method . The electronic encyclopedia may be distributed and accessed on a local storage device such as a DVD a set of CDs a hard drive a flash memory chip or any other type of memory device or it may be distributed and accessed over a network connection such as over the Internet or a wide area network for example. In another embodiment the information resource may include a website such as that of a large news organization library university government department academic society or research database. In another embodiment the information resource may include a large research citation website or a website for uploading drafts of research papers for example. In other embodiments the information resource may include a selected set of websites such as a group of science oriented government websites that includes the content of the websites for NASA the NOAA the Department of Energy the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health for example. Other embodiments are not limited to these illustrative examples but may include any other type of information resource from which the appropriate information may be extracted.

In one illustrative embodiment an electronic encyclopedia may include various encyclopedia entries articles or other documents about a variety of different named entities that include Colombia Columbia University Columbia River Space Shuttle Columbia and so forth. The names for these named entities may serve as the titles for the articles in the encyclopedia. As procedure of preparing the automatic disambiguation system is being performed the information is extracted from the article entitled Colombia nation including an indication that it is sometimes referred to under the spelling Columbia . A reference named entity record entitled Colombia is created in the named entity reference database and the reference named entity Colombia nation associated with the reference named entity is added to a reference surface form record for the surface form Columbia in a surface form reference database . Similarly information is extracted from a document about Columbia University in the electronic encyclopedia to create a reference named entity record for Columbia University with the reference named entity added to the record for reference surface form Columbia information is extracted from an entry in the electronic encyclopedia entitled Space Shuttle Columbia to add the corresponding reference named entity record in the named entity reference database and an associated addition to the record for reference surface form Columbia and so forth. The different steps and may be repeated iteratively for each document or other information resource from which information such as surface forms and entity indicators are extracted or information from several documents may be extracted and then stored together for example the different aspects of procedure may be performed in any order.

Each of the named entities extracted from an information resource may be stored with associations to several surface forms. For example the title of an article or other document may be extracted as a surface form for the named entity to which it is directed. A named entity may often be referred to by a surface form that unambiguously identifies it and may have a document in the information resource that is entitled with that unambiguous name. The title of an encyclopedia article may also have a distinguishing characteristic added to the title to keep the nature of the document free from ambiguity. For example an article in an electronic encyclopedia on the U.S. state of Georgia may be entitled Georgia U.S. state while another article may be entitled Georgia country . Both of these may be extracted as named entities with both of them associated with the surface form Georgia .

Information for the entity indicators may be collected at the same time as for surface forms. In this case for example the other information in these document titles could be stored among the labels for the respective reference named entity records so that the reference named entity record on Georgia U.S. state includes the label U.S. state and the reference named entity record on Georgia country includes the label country . The labels may constitute classifying identifiers applied to the respective named entities in the encyclopedia or other information source.

An electronic encyclopedia may also include documents such as a redirect entry or a disambiguation entry. For example it may have a redirect entry for NYC so that if a user enters the term New York City in a lookup field the NYC redirect page automatically redirects the user to an article on New York City. This information could therefore be extracted to provide a reference named entity record for New York City with an associated surface form of NYC . Similarly the surface form Washington and an associated context indicator of D.C. can be extracted from a document entitled Washington D.C. Context indicators are discussed further below.

Another feature an electronic encyclopedia may use is a disambiguation page. For example the encyclopedia may have a disambiguation page for the term Washington that appears if someone enters just the term Washington in a lookup field. The disambiguation page may provide a list of different options that the ambiguous term may refer to with links to the specific documents about each of the specific named entities which may include Washington D.C. Washington U.S. state George Washington and so forth. Information could therefore be extracted from this disambiguation page of the information resource for reference named entity records for each of the specific named entities listed with a surface form of Washington recorded for each of them and with context indicators extracted for each of the named entities based on the elaboration to the term Washington used to distinguish the different documents linked to on the disambiguation page.

Various other sources may also be used for extracting label and context information for the reference named entity records. For example different entries in the electronic encyclopedia may include category indicator tags and the encyclopedia may include a separate page for a category showing all the entries that are included in that category. For example the entries for Florida and Georgia U.S. state may both include category tags labeled Category U.S. States . The encyclopedia may also include separate pages for lists such as a page entitled List of the states in the United States of America with each entry on the list linked to the individual encyclopedia entry for that state.

Labels are not limited to the particular examples discussed above such as title information categories and other types of tags and list headings but may also include section names or sub headings within another article or a variety of other analogous labeling information.

Context indicators are other types of entity indicators that may be extracted from an electronic encyclopedia or other information resource and applied to respective named entities either alone or together with labels among other combinations in different embodiments. Context indicators may include attributes such as elements of text associated with their respective named entities by means of an association such as proximity in the title of an article in an encyclopedia or other type of information resource proximity to the name of the named entity in the text of an entry or article or inclusion in a link to or from another entry directed to another named entity in the information resource for example. As examples of linking context indicators an article about the Space Shuttle Columbia may include a reference to its serving mission to the Hubble Space Telescope with the phrase Hubble Space Telescope linked to an article on the same while another article on the Kennedy Space Center may include a reference to the Space Shuttle Columbia with a link to that article. The titles of articles linking both to and from the article on the space shuttle Columbia may be extracted as context indicators in the named entity reference record for Space Shuttle Columbia . Other types of context indicators may also be used that are not limited to these illustrative examples.

Context indicators and labels may both provide valuable indicators of what particular named entity is intended with a given surface form. For example the electronic encyclopedia may include an article that contains both the surface forms Discovery and Columbia . Their inclusion in the same article or their proximity to each other within the article may be taken as a context indicator of related content so that each term is recorded as a context indicator associated with the named entity reference of the other term under the specific named entity reference records for Space Shuttle Discovery and Space Shuttle Columbia in the named entity reference database. Additionally both terms may appear in an article entitled Space shuttles and they both may link to several other articles that have a high rate of linking with each other and with links to and from the article entitled Space shuttles . These different aspects may be translated into context indicators recorded in the named entity references such as a context indicator for the term space shuttle in both of the named entity reference records. It may also be used to weight the context indicators such as by giving greater weight to context indicators with a relatively higher number of other articles that also have links in common with both the named entity and the entity indicator.

Weighting the relevance of different entity indicators may also take the form of weighting some entity indicators at zero. This may be the case if a very large amount of potential entity indicators are available and certain criteria are used to screen out identity indicators that are predicted to be less relevant. For example context indicators may be extracted and recorded to a named entity reference record only if they are involved in an article linked from the article for the named entity that also links back to the article for the named entity or if the article for a candidate context indicator shares a threshold number of additional articles to which it and the article for the named entity share mutual links. Techniques such as these can effectively filter candidate context indicators to keep unhelpful indicators out of the named entity reference record.

Additionally both the Space Shuttle Discovery and Space Shuttle Columbia articles in the electronic encyclopedia may include category tags for Category Crewed Spacecraft and Category Space Shuttles . They may both also include a list tag for List of Astronautical Topics . These category and list tags and other potential tags may be extracted as labels for the named entity references for both named entities. The quantity of different labels and context indicators in common between the two named entity references could contribute to a measure of correlation or similarity between the two named entity references.

Returning to procedure with the automatic disambiguation system prepared by procedure it is ready to use to disambiguate named entities in a subject text. This subject text may be from a web browser a fixed layout document application an email application a word processing application or any other application that deals with the presentation of text output.

Procedure may also include some pre processing steps to facilitate identifying the surface forms of named entities. For example the system may split a document into sentences and truecase the beginning of each sentence hypothesizing whether the first word is part of an entity or it is capitalized because of orthographic conventions. It may also identify titles and hypothesize the correct case for words in the titles.

In a second stage of pre processing the text a statistical named entity recognizer may identify boundaries of mentions of the named entities in the text and assign each set of mentions sharing the same surface form a probability distribution over named entity labels such as Person Location Organization and Miscellaneous.

In this illustrative embodiment the named entity recognition component may also resolve structural ambiguity with regard to conjunctions e.g. The Ways and Means Committee Lewis and Clark possessives e.g. Alice s Adventures in Wonderland Britain s Tony Blair and prepositional attachment e.g. Whitney Museum of American Art Whitney Museum in New York by using surface form information extracted from the information resource when available with back off to co occurrence counts on the Web. The back off method can be applied recursively as follows for each ambiguous term Tof the form TParticle T where Particle is one of a possessive pronoun a coordinative conjunction or a preposition optionally followed by a determiner and the terms Tand Tare sequences of capitalized words and particles a web search can be performed on the search query T T which yields only search results in which the whole terms Tand Tappear. A collection of the top search results for example the first 200 may be evaluated to see how many also include the term T as a test of whether Tis a reference to one single entity or if Tand Tare two separate entities conjoined in context.

In a third stage of pre processing the text shorter or abbreviated surface forms may be resolved to longer forms. It is not uncommon for a named entity to be introduced in a document in a longer formal version of the name of the entity and for at least some subsequent mentions of the entity to be made with abbreviated or more casual surface forms. For example a text may introduce a reference to the named entity Franklin Delano Roosevelt and then make several subsequent references to the more abbreviated or casual surface forms Franklin Roosevelt President Roosevelt Roosevelt or simply FDR though some subsequent references to the full name of the named entity may also be made. A regular pattern consistent with this usage in the threshold search results may be taken to indicate that a set of a longer named entity with component forms of the named entity is indeed a regular relationship between a named entity and surface forms of the named entity in the text. Therefore before attempting to solve semantic ambiguity with subsequent steps of procedure the system may hypothesize in document co references and map short surface forms to longer surface forms with the same dominant label. For example Roosevelt PERSON can be mapped to Franklin Delano Roosevelt PERSON.

This is only one illustrative example of pre processing named references and surface forms in a document. Additional pre processing steps such as for resolving acronyms may also be resolved in a similar manner when possible. The system is not limited to any particular pre processing steps or to performing any pre processing steps in other embodiments.

Such pre processing stages may be followed by extracting the contextual and category information from the information resource to disambiguate the entities in the subject text following the steps of procedure . Procedure may produce the disambiguation output in any of a variety of forms. For example it may create hyperlinks in the subject text from the named entities and surface forms of the named entities to articles in the information resource directed to the named entities. Or in another embodiment the system may provide a pop up disambiguation output box adjacent to a pointer when the user hovers a pointer over a surface form as depicted in . Other embodiments are not limited to these illustrative examples but may provide any form of disambiguation output.

In one illustrative embodiment the disambiguation process may employ a vector space model in which a vectorial representation of the processed document is compared with vectorial representations of the named entity references stored in the named entity database Once the surface forms in a subject text are identified and the in document co references hypothesized the system may retrieve all possible entity disambiguations of each surface form. Their entity indicators such as the labels and context indicators that occur in the document may be aggregated into a document vector which is subsequently compared with named entity vectors representing the named entity references of various possible entity disambiguations so that one or more measures of correlation between the vectors representing surface forms in the text and the vectors representing the entity indicators may be evaluated. One of the reference named entities may then be identified for a particular surface form that maximizes the similarity between the document vector and the entity vectors. Or in other embodiments a reference named entity is identified that in some other way is found to have a high correlation to the surface form in the text relative to other candidate named entities.

The illustrative example of maximizing the similarity of the vectors representing the surface form from the subject text and the identified reference named entity may be elaborated on as follows in accordance with one illustrative embodiment. It may be well appreciated by those skilled in the art that a broad variety of other implementations may be analogous to or approximate to the illustrative implementation described here within the scope of various embodiments and furthermore that other embodiments may also be implemented with very substantial differences that nevertheless accomplish the broad outlines of aspects of the present disclosure.

In this illustrative example a vector space model may be used to evaluate measures of correlation or similarity between elements of a subject text and entity indicators. In this illustrative embodiment formally let C c . . . c be the set of known context indicators from the information resource and T t . . . t be the set of known labels. An entity e can then be represented as a vector 0 1 with two components 0 1and 0 1 corresponding to the context information and category labels respectively 

Let s denote the set of entities that are known to have a surface form s. For example in the named entities Columbia University and Space Shuttle Columbia are two named entities that both share a common surface form in Columbia . Let D be a document to be analyzed and let S D s . . . s be the set of surface forms identified in D. A context vector may be built as d d . . . d N where dis the number of occurrences of context indicators cin D. To account for all possible disambiguations of the surface forms in D an extended vector may also be built as Nso that d and

The goal in this illustrative embodiment is to find the assignment of entities to surface forms se i 1 . . . n that maximizes the agreement between d and d as well as the agreement between the labels of any two entities and . For example the document may contain both the surface forms Discovery and Columbia . On one hand the disambiguations Space Shuttle Discovery and Space Shuttle Columbia would share a large number of category labels and thus this assignment would result in a high agreement of their category components. On the other hand the category components for the disambiguations Space Shuttle Discovery an Colombia country would not be likely to generate a significant measure of correlation agreement between each other. This agreement maximization process is discussed in more detail further below. In another illustrative example agreement between different context indicators may be evaluated to maximize the agreement or correlation with entity indicators in the text. One document that mentions Columbia may also include the text strings NASA Kennedy Space Center and solid rocket booster leading to identification of the surface form Columbia with the named entity Space Shuttle Columbia . Another document that mentions Columbia may also include the text strings Bogota Cartagena and lvaro Uribe leading to identification of the surface form Columbia with the named entity Colombia nation .

One potential issue with Equation 1 is that an erroneous assignment of an entity to a surface form may interfere with the second term of Equation 1. This issue may be addressed with another strategy to account for category agreement which reduces the impact of erroneous assignments in a computationally efficient manner includes attempting to maximize agreement between the categories of the entity disambiguation of each surface form and the possible disambiguations of the other surface forms in the subject document or text. In one illustrative implementation this may be equivalent to performing the following Equation 2 

Using the definition of and partitioning the context and category components the sum in Equation 2 can be rewritten as

In this implementation the maximization of the sum in Equation2 is equivalent to the maximization of each of its terms which means that the computation reduces to

The disambiguation process following this illustrative embodiment therefore may include two steps first it builds the extended document vector and second it maximizes the scalar products in Equation 3. In various embodiments it is not necessary to build the document vector over all context indicators C but only over the context indicators of the possible entity disambiguations of the surface forms in the document.

One illustrative embodiment may include normalizing the scalar products by the norms of the vectors and thereby computing the cosine distance similarity. In another illustrative embodiment following Equation 3 the scalar products are not normalized by the norms of the vectors but rather an implicit accounting is made for the frequency with which a surface form is used to mention various entities and for the importance of these entities as indicated by entities that have longer articles in the information resource that are mentioned more frequently in other articles and that tend to have more category tags and other labels according to an illustrative embodiment. A broad variety of other methods of evaluating the measures of similarity may be used in different embodiments illustratively including Jensen Shannon divergence Kullback Liebler divergence mutual information and a variety of other methods in other embodiments.

In some illustrative instances one surface form can be used to mention two or more different entities within the same text or document. To account for such cases the described disambiguation process may be performed iteratively in this embodiment for the surface forms that have two or more disambiguations with high similarity scores with the extended document vector. This may be done by iteratively shrinking the context used for the disambiguation of each instance of such a surface form from document level to paragraph level and if necessary to sentence level for example. For example in the surface form Columbia appears twice fairly close together but intended to indicate two different named entities. The disambiguation data may be restricted to the sentence level in the immediate proximity of these two surface forms or may concentrate the weightings assigned to entity indicators within the immediate sentence of the surface forms in different embodiments. In one illustrative implementation this would accord an overwhelming weight to entity indicators such as NASA for the first surface form of Columbia while assigning overwhelming weight to entity indicators such as master s degree for the second surface form of Columbia thereby enabling them to be successfully disambiguated into identifications with the named entities of the Space Shuttle Columbia and Columbia University respectively according to this illustrative embodiment.

In another illustrative implementation a user may be able to indicate a subset of text to be evaluated for disambiguation of surface forms where the subset may be selected from among a group of optional units of text such as a document a page a paragraph a sentence or a manually selected portion of text.

In yet another illustrative example a number of different candidate surface forms that overlap each other may be identified in the same text and the different candidate surface forms may be separately evaluated to identify one of the overlapping surface forms that is associated with one of the reference named entities in the surface form reference for which the associated entity indicators have a relatively high correlation to the text. A disambiguation output may then be provided that indicates the identified surface form and the reference named entity associated with the identified surface form in this illustrative implementation.

Various embodiments of software and methods for automatic disambiguation may be embodied as modules within applications or as separate applications that act on other text associated applications or may take other forms relative to the document or other form of text on which they operate. An automatic disambiguation module or application may act upon text in any of a broad range of applications which may illustratively include but are not limited to a word processing application a presentation application a spreadsheet application a database application an email application an instant messaging application an information manager application a web page application a web page editing application a reference work application a fixed layout document application a desktop publishing application a diagramming application a project management application a form developer application a customer relationship management application an enterprise resource planning application a field services application a retail management application a social networking application a tax preparation application a finance management application an accounting application and a game application for example.
