This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60 888 669 filed on Feb. 7 2007.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

This invention relates to devices kits and methods enabling simultaneous detection of several biological threat agents including viruses and bacteria during combat or in suspected contaminated samples or locations. The present invention allows such detection by selectively binding the nucleic acids of such biological threat agents to a solid substrate and allows an operator to inspect the solid substrate for color patterns preferably by eye.

With increasing terrorist activities occurring around the world new technologies must be developed enabling the detection of biological threat agents both in combat and civilian environments. Current detection methods identifying biological threat agents such as viruses and bacteria use ELISA enzyme linked immunological assay and PCR polymerase chain reaction based on nucleic acid amplification as operative core platforms. Such detection methods work well in hospitals or other medical institutions but are not as well suited for biodefense applications. ELISA and other antibody based methods require stable antibodies and enzymes which have low stability after deployment and therefore do not last long during combat or during long transports to suspected compromised areas. PCR methods require thermal cyclers energy supply sources and a large logistic footprint that either consumes resources needed in other tasks or requires sensitive equipment that is not easy to transport.

In addition ELIZA and PCR based detection methods are limited in that they are not able to detect multiple threat agents at once particularly under conditions encountered in combat or a threat situation. One is able to detect several virus types using PCR but the amount of virus types that can be detected at once is limited by the number of fluorochromes that are available for differentiating. In addition PCR multiplexing techniques are generally expensive and require delicate equipment that is not easily transported. PCR multiplexing is costly complex and does not function well to analyze the massive amounts of agent present after a biological attack.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to meet the foregoing needs by providing detection devices kits and methods capable of detecting one or more biological threat agents simultaneously in a simple and cost effective manner. A suspect sample a sample thought to contain a biological threat agent may be obtained from a combat location or a civilian threat location. The methods and devices of the present invention preferably enable the identification of one or more biological threat agents by simple visual inspection of a detection means. The devices kits and methods of the present invention can be easily performed without extensive training of an operator complex equipment or vast logistic support. The operator of the methods and devices of the present invention include soldiers having little or no training in microbiology or virology.

The formulation of the diluting buffer includes a a buffer like Tris HCl Trizma Base at a concentration between 10 and 200 mM and at a pH between 7 9 alternatively other buffer formulations such as Na Phosphate Buffer 10 to 100 mM in 20 SUCROSE pH 7.0 pH8 can be used b a lytic enzyme such as lysozyme used at a concentration between 0.1 and 5 mg ml most preferably at 2.5 mg ml or Bactozol or DNAzol which is a guanidine detergent lysing solution from Molecular Research Center Inc. is added c a mixture of proteolytic enzymes that digest the protein wall of the target microorganisms such as Pronase and or Proteinase K in solutions between containing between 10 and 100 mg of enzyme ml d a chelator like EDTA at concentrations typically between 1 and 10 mM and e a detergent for example from the Tween family e.g. Tween 20 Tween 40 Tween 60 etc. or others such as NP 40 Triton X or SDS at concentration between 5 20 w v. Alternatively or in addition a surfactant such as diethylene glycol monoethyl ether DGME ethylene glycol monobutyl ether and N methyl 2 pyrrolidone at concentration between 1 and 20 w v can facilitate sample disruption and nucleic acid extraction.

One example of an eluting buffer used in the present invention consists of either distilled water or TE buffer Tris EDTA buffer 10 mM Tris 0.1 mM EDTA pH 7.5 . The eluting buffer releases nucleic acids from the nucleic acid binding membrane of first solid support .

One example of a hybridization buffer used in the present invention includes a SCC buffer concentrated between 0.5 and 20 20 SCC is 175.3 g l of NaCl 27.6 g l NaH2PO and 7.4 g l EDTA pH 7.4 b 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4 c a chelator such as EDTA 1 mM pH 8.0 d salt 0.4M NaCl and e formamide at concentrations between 10 and 80 v v .

The hybridization buffer is employed after the nucleic acids have been extracted by lyses and purified by binding to and elution from nucleic acid binding membranes. A range of hybridization conditions can be used depending on the stringency required with hybridization temperatures ranging from 5 C. to 70 C. preferably between 15 C. and 55 C. and more preferably between 30 and 52 C. Hybridization conditions also can be varied within two units of pH around neutral pH 7.0 preferably between pH 6.5 and 7.8 more preferable at pH 7.4.

One example of a hybridization wash buffer used in the present invention includes 0.5 5 SSC v v and 0.05 5 w v SDS in sterile distilled water.

Several labeling technologies can be used in chamber L and various labeling protocols can be employed without departing from the spirit of this invention. One example of a labeling technology used in the present invention includes biotinylated probes capable of being detected with streptavidin coupled to alkaline phosphatase AP . Streptavidin AP conjugates capable of binding specifically and irreversibly to the biotin labeled probes. A chromogenic substrate 0.02 BCIP 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl phosphate 0.03 NBT nitro blue tetrazolium in 0.05 0.2M TBS pH 8 10 allowing the visualization of the Streptavidin AP label probes. The product of this reaction is a blue purple precipitate that is visible by the naked eye.

Another example of labeling technology used in the present invention is Tyramide signal amplification TSA in combination with Molecular Probes proprietary dyes and other proprietary detection technologies. TSA is an enzyme mediated detection method that utilizes the catalytic activity of horseradish peroxidase HRP to generate high density labeling of a target nucleic acid sequence bound to a membrane. The TSA method is capable of increasing the detection sensitivity up to 100 fold as compared with conventional avidin biotinylated enzyme complex ABC that were used during first experiments.

Another example of labeling technology preferred for use in the present invention is the digoxigenin DIG labeling technology. A DIG label probe is first incubated in pre hybridization buffer consisting typically of 3 M NaCl 0.4 M Tris hydrochloride pH 7.8 and 20 mM EDTA 50 Denhardt is 1 Ficoll 1 polyvinylpyrrolidone and 1 bovine serum albumin in distilled water 100 g of denatured calf thymus DNA per ml and 0.5 sodium dodecyl sulfate. Incubation time depends on sample volume temperature and presence of adjuvants see above . By addition of formamide 50 v v incubation proceeds for 30 minutes under partially optimized conditions.

Various reagents can be used to develop color of DIG labeled nucleic acids for example Anti Dig Fab fragments conjugated to alkaline phosphatase equilibrated in buffer and alkaline phosphatase substrate consisted of a solution A 75 mg of Nitro Blue Tetrazolium per ml of 70 dimethylformamide a solution B 75 mg of 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolylphosphate toluidine salt Sigma per ml of dimethylformamide and 10 ml of equilibration buffer. Development of the dark blue color reaction proceeds quite rapidly generally within minutes and color and reagents are stable under harsh conditions such as can be encountered during deployment.

Can be used after Digoxeginenin labeling of the sample product and amplification of the signal with Anti Digoxeginenin POD poly Fab fragments these other chromogenic substrates that can be used in the present invention include DAB Diaminobenzidine 3 4 3 4 tetraminobiphenyl used at 1.39 mM DAB 0.01 H2O2 v v in 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.3. The reaction product is a brown very stable water insoluble precipitate which is also insoluble in ethanol. In addition BM blue POD substrate precipitating TMB 3 3 5 5 Tetramethylbenzidine in buffer solution ready to use. The reaction product is a dark blue precipitate which is insoluble in water. All these precipitates can be seen with the naked eye and are stable under conditions to be encountered in combat or civilian threat situations.

In addition another example of labeling technology used in the present invention is Naphthyl red which can also be used to detect nucleic acids because the dye shows distinct chromism by hybridization with its complementary nucleic acid. Single stranded DNA involving the Naphthyl Red moiety exhibits an orange color and has a maximal absorption at 466 nm blue at pH 7.0. The absorption maximum is shifted towards 545 nm green by the presence of its complementary DNA and the color of the solution changes from orange to magenta accordingly. See reference DNA Naphthyl Red conjugate as a visualizing probe of DNA hybridization. Asanuma H Kashida H Liang X Komiyama M. Chem Commun Camb . 2003 Jul. 7 13 1536 1537 

Label washing Buffers help remove unbound label from the solid support containing capture nucleic acid as used in the present invention. A preferred label wash buffer consists generally of a 50 100 mM Tris hydrochloride buffer pH 7 8 b 150 250 mM NaCl and c a blocking reagent like normal sheep serum 10 w v in phosphate buffered saline . Another example of a label wash buffer consists of a 50 70 Ethanol b 20 200 mM Tris ClH pH 7 9 c 5 10 M Sodium chloride or lithium chloride and d a chelator such as EDTA at a concentration between 10 and 150 mM .

The first solid support or membrane used in the present invention is preferably made of a material that is or acts as an ionic exchange silica or a binding agent that selectively binds nucleic acids under the proper salt or ionic conditions. The first solid support may be a nucleic acid binding membrane. Such a membrane helps purify the nucleic acids from proteins lipids and other cellular debris. The nucleic acid binding membrane binds all the nucleic acids from any microorganism irrespective of the identity of the microbe or its nucleic acid sequence. The forces that attach nucleic acids to this binding membrane are of physical or chemical nature not by specific genetic complementary . The nucleic acid may be bound to the membrane surface by affinity or electro statically for example binding of negatively charged nucleic acid from the microbe to a positively charged surface such as ionic exchange materials affinity materials silica positively charged membranes or positively charged columns.

A second solid support or membrane such as a hybridization membrane is able to bind target nucleic acids by hybridization to complementary capture nucleic acids attached to the solid support. Capture nucleic acids may be attached to solid supports by several approaches. The preferred approach is by cross linking the capture nucleic acid to a solid support such as a membrane usually by baking or UV exposure . Alternatively capture nucleic acids may be bound to a surface by affinity. For example binding of negatively charged capture nucleic acid to a positively charge surface such as ionic exchange materials affinity materials silica positively charged membranes or positively charged columns. Also capture nucleic acids may be labeled with a generic ligand to a membrane coated with the generic ligand s ligant. For example by binding capture nucleic acids labeled with Avidin to a membrane coated with streptavidin or vice versa.

A list of capture probes with the corresponding sequences complementary to a variety of threat biological agents has been disclosed previously. The device of the present invention was shown to work in combination with a second solid support preferably in the shape of a strip or a comb filter with the second solid support having bound on its surface one or more capture nucleic acid s . Other shapes of the second solid support may be used in the present invention and be able to perform similar as described herein.

The device of the present invention is used to facilitate the identification of a biological threat agent in combat or in a civilian threat situation. Rapid identification in such situations by military and or a non military personal is required to quickly execute the correct protective measures and clean up or decontamination procedures.

A suspect sample is identified and a soldier or like responder removes the moving means from the multiplex field device and uncovers the central chamber . The multiplex field device is prepackaged with the peripheral chambers containing materials including buffers solutions and other materials used in the present invention. Peripheral chamber D contains diluting buffer peripheral chamber LW contains a wash buffer peripheral chamber E contains eluting material peripheral chamber H contains hybridization buffer peripheral chamber Hw contains a hybridization wash buffer and peripheral chamber L contains labeling buffer. The soldier opens the cap of the central capped chamber and places the suspect sample i.e. powder liquid etc into the interior space of the central capped chamber and on top of the filter . The soldier slightly taps the device allowing fine particles if a solid powder to penetrate the filter and contact the first solid support contained in a central chamber . Larger particles are retained on the filter . The central capped chamber is position so that the connecting conduit PC is aligned with aperture in communication with peripheral chamber D . The moving means is reattached and then used to create positive or negative pressure. As a result the diluting buffer is moved from peripheral chamber D through aperture and connecting conduit PC into the central capped chamber and is incubated with the sample. The diluting material is then removed from the central capped chamber through connecting conduit WC and waste chamber aperture into the waste chamber .

Next central capped chamber with nucleic acid bound to the binding membrane or first solid support is then rotated to communicate with a peripheral chamber LW containing washing buffer. Communication occurs when the connecting conduit PC aligns with an aperture in the side of peripheral chamber LW . The wash buffer contained in peripheral chamber LW is moved into the central capped chamber through the aperture and connecting conduit washing the nucleic acids bound on the binding membrane . Moving means is preferably used to move the washing buffer through the membrane and collected in the waste chamber . Next the central capped chamber is rotated in such a way as to enable the alignment of connecting conduit PC with aperture located on the side of peripheral chamber E . Peripheral chamber E contains eluting buffer. The eluting buffer passes through aperture and the connecting conduit PC into the interior of the central capped chamber . The eluting buffer contacts the solid support or membrane and releases the bound nucleic acid s . The released nucleic acids and eluting buffer are then moved into hybridization chamber H when the connecting conduit WC is aligned with aperture . The eluting buffer containing the target nucleic acid present mixes with the hybridization buffer present in peripheral chamber H and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes. This incubation period allows the target nucleic acid s to hybridize with capture nucleic acid s present on the second solid support or membrane present in the peripheral chamber H . The second solid support contains an array of capture nucleic acid sequences complementary to the nucleic acid sequences of a series of threat biological agents i.e. target nucleic acid sequences. Only specific target nucleic acid sequences with complementary sequences to the capture nucleic acid sequences will bind to the second solid support .

After the incubation is completed the material and all the nucleic acid sequences that do not correspond to the capture nucleic acid sequences are removed from peripheral chamber H by use of the moving means . The central capped chamber is rotated in a clockwise direction aligning connecting conduit WC and aperture which leads directly to the waste chamber where the mixture is sent by use of the moving means which may comprise a pump.

The second solid support with specific nucleic acids attached is washed with hybridization wash buffer. The central capped chamber is rotated in clockwise direction to enable alignment of connecting conduit PC with aperture of peripheral chamber Hw . This enables the hybridization wash buffer to move from peripheral chamber Hw to peripheral chamber H through tube by way of pressure change. The hybridization wash buffer is then removed after covering the hybridization membrane by reversing the moving means .

Immediately thereafter the operator rotates the central capped chamber clockwise to align the connecting conduit PC with peripheral chamber L through aperture . This enables the labeling solution to move from peripheral chamber L to peripheral chamber H through tube by way of a pressure change through the use of the moving means . The labeling solution is preferably a solution of secondary specific probes preferably labeled with digoxigenin . Other conventional labeling solutions and probes may be used. Thus the labeling solution is brought from chamber L onto the hybridization membrane in chamber H and nucleic acids specifically hybridized to the membrane are labeled by incubating for a time of approximately 15 minutes or until nucleic acids in membrane can be visualized as dots by the naked eye. The identity of biological threat agents will be identified by the array of color produced on the solid support or membrane . A key on the back of the device or on another convenient location based on an array of colors produced identifies a specific biological threat agent. A soldier or other user simply compares the array of color seen on the solid support to the key and the key tells the user if there is one or more biological threat agents in the sample.

The processing of the sample is attained by simply lifting and lowering a piston or pistons syringe type of moving means comprising integral parts of the device and rotating the central chamber relative to the surrounding chambers with reagents appropriate for each analytical step. Rotation is made by the operator manually without additional sources of energy but electrical or electronic operation can be envisioned without departing from the spirit of the present invention. A series of conduits and ports allow fluid transfer between aligning chambers. After processing the sample a signal corresponding to a biological threat agent can be observed by visual inspection by the naked eye i.e. of stains or colors in membrane within the device. The use of nucleic acid sensors able to discriminate the presence of target nucleic acids hybridized to a membrane from background signals in the absence of target can be eventually used without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Once used the device is disposable. Infectious organisms once inside the device are degraded to their nucleic acid constituents rendering any organism non infectious and the operation of the device safe. Since the device is self contained contains all needed reagents and operator powered the device does not need any substantial logistic support.

Additional chambers may be added to the present invention. For example such chambers that could hold additional solutions such as wash buffer label solutions etc.

Although the present invention has been described in detail with reference to examples above it is understood that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly the invention is limited only by the following claims. All cited patents patent applications and publications referred to in this application are herein expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.
