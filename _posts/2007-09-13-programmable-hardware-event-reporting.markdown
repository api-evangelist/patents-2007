title: Programmable hardware event reporting
abstract: Approaches for reporting hardware events from circuitry implemented in an integrated circuit (IC). The IC is configured with a circuit to be analyzed and an event monitor circuit. A process invokes an application programming interface (API) function that references an operating system managed object. The API function includes a parameter value that references the object. The process is operated in a first manner when the object is in a first state. An interrupt signal is generated by the event monitor circuit to the processor in response to an input signal from the circuit under analysis, which initiates execution of an interrupt handler. The object is placed in a second state by the interrupt handler. The process is operated in a second manner different from the first manner in response to the object transitioning to the second state.
