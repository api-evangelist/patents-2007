title: System for authentication of network usage
abstract: Apparatus for collecting subscription data for subscribers in a telecommunications system for use in metering usage of network resources includes a data storage device operatively arranged to store subscriber records, and a data processor. The subscriber records include a plurality of fields including a group field for storing data indicative of group membership of a subscriber. The data processor is operatively arranged to request access to a remotely accessible information source on the basis of identification data. Responsive to receipt of a response from the remotely accessible information source, the data processor performs a first storage action in respect of a response of a first type and performs a second storage action in respect of a response of a second type. Responsive to receipt of group membership data from the subscriber, the data processor is operatively arranged to identify a remotely accessible information source corresponding to the group and to request access thereto on the basis of identification data associated with the received group membership data. Also, responsive to a response of the first type received from the remotely accessible information source, the data processor is operatively arranged to update the group field in the subscriber record so as to indicate authenticated membership of the group identified in the received group membership data.
