title: Strip charge storage arrangement
abstract: A storage arrangement for a strip charge includes a spool having a central aperture into which is placed an end of the strip charge, and a channel extending from the central aperture out to a peripheral wall around which the strip charge is wound. The channel includes a slightly curving portion so as not to unduly bend the strip charge. The spool is removably attached to a base plate that maintains the strip charge in place prior to use.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates to explosive charges and more particularly to a storage arrangement for an elongated flexible strip charge.

A strip charge is an elongated flexible explosive device used for example to breach structures such as a door or wall. As currently stored the strip charge is wound around itself and placed in a foil bag prior to use.

This method of storage causes cracks in the strip charge that prevents detonation and destroys the intended use of the strip charge. In addition the tightly wound strip charge develops a shape memory which prevents natural unraveling of the strip charge after being secured to a target structure.

It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a storage arrangement for a strip charge that prevents cracks in the strip charge.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a storage arrangement for a strip charge that minimizes the tendency to assume a shape memory.

To attain the objects described there is provided a strip charge storage arrangement comprising a generally cylindrical spool having a top surface a bottom surface and a peripheral wall. The spool includes an aperture extending from the top surface to the bottom surface. An open channel extends from the aperture to the peripheral wall and has a slightly curving portion.

In use a strip charge is connected at one end to an initiator assembly within the aperture is conducted through the channel around the curved portion and is wound around the peripheral wall. To better maintain the strip charge on the spool the spool is removable attached to a base plate with removal taking place prior to deployment.

A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals and symbols designate identical and corresponding parts through the views.

Referring now to there is illustrated a strip charge storage arrangement which includes a spool removably attached to a base plate .

The spool has a top surface a bottom surface and a peripheral wall . An aperture extends from the top surface to the bottom surface and is preferably centrally located. An open channel extends from the central aperture to the peripheral wall and includes slightly and gently curving portion . Although the diameter of the spool may vary it is preferred that the minimum diameter is about three inches. Similarly although the radius of curvature of the curved portion may vary it is preferred that the radius of curvature is at least about an inch and a half. Of course the center of curvature of the curved portion is different than the center of the spool . An exemplary width of the peripheral wall is about one inch. The spool may be made of any desired material for example rigid foam such as polyurethane foam.

To detonate the strip charge there is provided an initiator assembly within the aperture which is connected to an end of the strip charge. The initiator assembly by way of example may be comprised of a booster having a central opening into which is placed a detonator .

A typical deployment of the explosive charge is illustrated in and . Prior to deployment the base plate is removed. In a person is using the tape to tape the end of the strip charge to a structure to be breached. The structure by way of example is a door .

After taping the end to the door the spool is released and falls by gravity to unroll the strip charge until it is fully deployed as illustrated in . With the present invention the strip charge does not develop a shape memory that would prevent the strip charge from unrolling under the force of gravity.

It is preferred that the strip charge storage arrangement be protected from the elements prior to use. illustrates a protective system. The strip charge storage arrangement including the spool base plate strip charge and initiator assembly is encased in a shrink wrap foil material which is air tight and fulfills the desired protection objective.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
