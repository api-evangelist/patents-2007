A mobile computing device such as a combination handheld computer and mobile telephone or smart phone generally may provide voice and data communications functionality as well as computing and processing capabilities. As the functionality of mobile computing devices continues to improve the amount of content to be displayed increases. While the amount of content presented to a user in the display area of a mobile computing device continues to increase the size of mobile computing devices continues to decrease. It is desirable therefore for mobile computing devices to use a reduced amount of display area to display both voice transmission signal strength and data transmission strength. Consequently there exists a substantial need for techniques to improve the status indicator for displaying signal strength for mobile computing devices.

Various embodiments may be generally directed to a method and apparatus to display signal strength. In one embodiment for example a mobile computing device may comprise a status indicator module coupled to a display. The status indicator module displays a first signal strength and a second signal strength for different radio transmission signals using a single status indicator on the display. In this manner a user may be able to simultaneously view both voice transmission signal strength and data transmission signal strength using a single display indicator. Other embodiments are described and claimed.

Current solutions allow a user to view either voice transmission signal strength or data transmission signal strength in a single indicator but do not allow a user to view both voice and data transmission signal strength at the same time using a single status indicator. Current solutions that utilize a signal status indicator switch between displaying voice transmission signal strength or data transmission signal strength. If a disparity exists between the voice and data transmission signal strength a user s expectation of system performance may be affected based on the current solution because only half of the relevant information is being displayed at any time. For example if voice transmission signal strength is strong and data transmission signal strength is weak and only voice transmission signal strength is presented to a user via a signal status indicator the user may be disappointed when assuming that they have a strong connection based on the data presented by the single status indicator they unsuccessfully attempt to utilize a data transmission connection.

Viewing both voice transmission signal strength and data transmission signal strength at the same time using current solutions requires two separate status indicators that take up valuable display area. As the amount of content presented to a user in the display area of mobile computing devices continues to increase and the size of mobile computing devices continues to decrease it becomes important to conserve display area. Therefore various embodiments are directed to techniques to improve the status indicator for displaying signal strength for mobile computing devices.
