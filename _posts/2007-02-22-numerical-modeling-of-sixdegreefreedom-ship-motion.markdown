title: Numerical modeling of six-degree-freedom ship motion
abstract: The present invention's new calculative methodology models the motion of a seagoing vessel in six dimensions, uniquely employing a total velocity potential as the sole parameterization for taking into consideration all linear and nonlinear dynamical effects involved in interaction between the vessel and environmental water. The solid-body rotational motion of the vessel about the vessel's center of mass is determined in three dimensions (roll, pitch, yaw) by calculating the pressure torque and the buoyancy torque. The solid-body translational motion of the vessel's center of mass is determined in three dimensions (heave, surge, sway) by calculating the pressure force and the buoyancy force. The pressure torque and the pressure force are each associated with pressure (e.g., non-hydrostatic pressure) of water on the vessel's surface. The buoyancy torque and the buoyancy force are each associated with the displacement of the vessel with respect to the vessel's equilibrium position in the water.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application no. 60 847 396 filing date 15 Sep. 2006 hereby incorporated herein by reference entitled On the Impact of Above Waterline Ship Geometry on Roll Motion joint inventors Ray Qing Lin and Weijia Kuang.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to motions of marine vessels while interacting with environmental waves more particularly to methodologies for modeling such motions.

A seagoing ship is characterized by motion describable in terms of six degrees of freedom viz. heave surge sway roll pitch and yaw. More generally the term six degrees of freedom is conventionally used to describe both translational motion and rotational motion of a body with respect to three perpendicular axes in three dimensional space. Regarding motion of ships the three kinds of translational ship motion are commonly referred to as heave linear movement along a vertical axis surge linear movement along a horizontal fore and aft axis and sway linear movement along a horizontal port and starboard axis the three kinds of rotational ship motion are commonly referred to as roll rotational movement about a horizontal fore and aft axis pitch rotational movement about a horizontal port and starboard axis and yaw rotational movement about a vertical axis .

Ship motion at sea has always been among the most important problems for naval architects and engineers. Accurate prediction of the ship motions in real time can be critical for preventing large amplitude ship motions or the capsizing of vessels. This is particularly so for some modern day marine vessels such as fast passenger ferries high powered naval vessels and high powered cargo ships.

The history of ship motion research can be traced back more than a half century. In 1953 St. Denis and Pierson first proposed a statistical ship response in a realistic seaway by approximating ship motion in a linear system. Their work provided a respected tool to naval architects for estimating ship motions. Peters and Stoker 1957 then developed the first analytical prediction theory see A. S. Peters and J. J. Stoker The Motion of a Ship As a Floating Rigid Body in a Seaway 10 399 490 1957. Because in their theory the ship s beam and unsteady motions are assumed comparable and small Peters and Stokers theory is called a first order theory. Later Newman 1961 improved the first order theory by introducing a set of small parameters and better body boundary conditions see J. N. Newman A Linearized Theory for the Motion of a Thin Ship in Regular Waves 3 1 1 9 1961.

Ogilvie and Tuck 1969 developed a strip theory in which the linear ship motion coefficients are introduced based on the slender body assumption such as added masses and damping coefficients for heave and pitch motions see T. F. Ogilvie and O. Tuck A Rational Strip Theory of Ship Motions Part I Report 13 Dept. of the Navy . University of Michigan Ann Arbor pages 92 1969. Since Ogilvie and Tuck s strip theory includes terms containing some surface integration over the free surface it is very difficult to implement computationally. There is an inconsistency in the strip theory the formulation is applicable in the short wavelength domains while the slender body approximation works in long wavelength domains. Improvements in strip theory were developed to reconcile the difference existing within Tuck s strip theory. Notably Maruo 1970 developed an interpolation theory and later Newman 1978 developed a unified theory so that the first order theory approach can be applied over wider frequency domains see H. Maruo An Improvement of the Slender Body Theory for Oscillating Ships with Zero Forward Speed 19 45 56 1970 J. N. Newman The Theory of Ship Motions 18 221 83 1978.

As faster and more powerful computers have become available the Neumann Kelvin approach which basically involves strip theory has been adopted in numerical modeling such as disclosed by Beck and Magee 1990 Magee 1994 and Shin et al. 1997 see R. F. Beck R. F. and A. R. Magee Time Domain Analysis for Predicting Ship Motions W. G. Price P. Temarel A. J. Keane Eds. Elvesier Sciences Publishers B. V. pages 49 64 1990 A. Magee Seakeeping Applications using a Time Domain Method 20. Santa Barbara Calif. 19 pages 1994 Y. S. Shin J. S. Chung W. M. Lin S. Zhang and A. Engle Dynamic Loadings for Structural Analysis of Fine Form Container Ship Based on a Non Linear Large Amplitude Motions and Loads Method 105 127 54 1997. Although Neumann Kelvin is a linear theory it has been a great success in ship motion research because it can be applied to arbitrary exact ship surfaces and because the hull boundary conditions can be satisfied on the exact wetted surface of the ship body with the linearized free surface boundary conditions.

Nevertheless the Neumann Kelvin theory has its own problems such as in solving a forward speed Green function in finite water depth see R. F. Beck and A. M. Reed Modern Seakeeping Computations for Ships 23 Val de Reuil France National Academy of Sciences pages 1 43 2000. Still as pointed out by Beck and Reed probably about eighty percent of design related to ship motion calculation is based on the strip theory because compared to other theories it is fast reliable and able to accommodate various hull forms. In fact all linear theories are ultimately beset with limitations in particular they cannot model any nonlinear processes. In many cases the nonlinear processes dominate the linear effects in determining ship motions. To address this limitation several blending methods were developed. For a detailed discussion the reader is referred to the ISSC report on Extreme Hull Girder Loading 1 142000 Nagasaki Japan 59 pages 2000.

More recently Wilson et al. 1998 and Gentaz et al. 1999 attempted to solve the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations in time domain RANS see R. Wilson E. Paterson and F. Stern Unsteady RANS CFD Method for Naval Combatants in Waves 22nd Washington D.C. Washington D.C. Natl. Acad. Press pages 532 49 1998 L. Gentaz P. E. Guillermo B. Alessandrini and G. Delhommeau Three dimensional Free Surface Viscous Flow around a Ship in Forced Motion 7. Paris France 12 pages. Wilson et al. and Gentaz et al. applied iterative methods for steady solutions and time stepping methods for unsteady solutions. Their approaches are by far inconclusive partly due to insufficient numerical results. In general Wilson et al. and Gentaz et al. have convergence problems when the sea environment is rough and the ship forward speed is high.

According to traditional ship motion analysis the translational and rotational solid body motions six degrees of freedom of ships are approximated with parameterized forces. The traditional formulation is straightforward but is dynamically inconsistent because the forces involved are very complicated and correspond to each other in accordance with the dynamics of the ship motion. These complex forces are associated with interactions between the ship and surface waves and with departures of the ship from its equilibrium position. In principle appropriate parameterization of such complicated dynamical forces is impossible. Consequently it is common in conventional practice to introduce additional parameters lacking solid physics foundations in order to emulate real ship solid body motions. An unwanted side effect of this approach is that the introductions of additional but unnecessary variables hamper computational efficiencies.

Many studies have been made on the nonlinearity of ship motion. For example Y. Liu et al. A High Order Spectral Method for Nonlinear Wave Body Interactions 245 115 136 1992 uses a high order spectral method to study nonlinear interactions between the ship and the water surface. See also W. M. Lin et al. Numerical Solution for Large Amplitude Ship Motions in the Time Domain 18. U. Michigan Ann Arbor Mich. 1990 W. M. Lin et al.

Unfortunately there are still empirical or linear parameters used in modeling six degree freedom ship motions e.g. added mass and damping mass for each degree of motion. The intrinsic limitations of these parameters can potentially affect the accuracy of the nonlinear ship motion models. For example the added mass and the damping mass are often determined from the ship s geometry below the waterline in calm water see A. R. Magee and R. F. Beck Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering College of Engineering University of Michigan 1988 e.g. page 192. However the ship s geometry below the waterline when the ship is underway in waves is very different from that in calm water and is continually changing due to speed and wave action.

It is therefore desirable to develop a new ship motion model that maintains similar advantages of the strip theory but also efficiently models all nonlinear processes in ship motions that is based on the fundamental laws of physics and precise mathematical formulations that is consistent with variations of water environments and ship properties and that is capable of simulating ship position variations due to ship wave interactions.

In view of the foregoing it is an object of the present invention to provide a robust numerical model that can be used to study the motions of ships traveling through environmental waves.

Another object of the present invention is to provide such a model that is sufficiently flexible for arbitrary single hull and multi hull ships.

A further object of the present invention is to provide such a model that is sufficiently flexible for extreme environmental conditions.

It is a another object of the present invention to provide such a model that is computationally efficient.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a model that is capable of real time or near real time applications.

The present inventors afore noted nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 11 518 740 filed 1 Sep. 2006 discloses inter alia their inventive numerical model of nonlinear ship wave interactions. Application Ser. No. 11 518 740 is largely concerned with the hydrodynamics of interactions between ships and surface waves e.g. surface wave modifications due to ship motions. In contrast the instant application is largely concerned with the motions of ships in the context of interactions between ships and surface waves e.g. ship position variations due to ship wave interactions. The present invention s numerical model evaluates time variation of ship solid body motion translational and rotational motion under the forces arising from arbitrary ship surface wave interactions and ship underwater positions.

According to the inventive hydrodynamics model of U.S. nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 11 518 740 filed on 1 Sep. 2006 the spectral method is used to solve surface waves in the numerical domain taking mathematical advantage of similarities between surface wave solutions and the basic functions of the spectral expansion. The spectral method is found by the present inventors to be inappropriate for the ship body however. Ship dimensions are in general much smaller than those of the numerical domain and the ship body geometries can be very complicated often with corners and sharp edges. If spectral method were used to solve for the ship body then the truncation order would be extremely high and special effort would be required to avoid Gibbs effects caused by sharp edges. Instead the inventive hydrodynamics model uses finite element method in ship boundary and pseudo spectral method in global domain. A quasi linear method is used in each time step to transform the information between the ship boundary and global domain. The inventive hydrodynamics model thus enables efficient study of complicated ship geometry in steep incident waves. It succeeds in evaluating physical quantities in different numerical meshes. Also disclosed in U.S. nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 11 518 740 is a ship surface pressure correction method to calculate pressure. According to the inventive pressure determination method any singularity characterizing pressure distribution is eliminated and a smooth function permits efficient and accurate calculation of pressure.

The present inventors U.S. application Ser. No. 11 518 740 discloses a fully nonlinear computationally efficient hydrodynamics model characterized by steady ship motion. The term steady ship motion as used by the present inventors implies that the response of the ship to all exerting forces arising from ship wave wave wave interactions is not included. In effect the instant application adds the ship response in the form of six degree solid body motion to the corresponding effect on surface waves with which U.S. application Ser. No. 11 518 740 is concerned . By the instant disclosure the present inventors incorporate ship solid body motion dynamics into their hybrid model. The present invention involves solid body motion instead of rigid body motion because the bending effects on the ship are not taken into consideration.

Speaking generally in the fields of fluid dynamics and fluid mechanics a velocity potential is a scalar function for the flow of a fluid e.g. an irrotational fluid wherein the gradient of the scalar function is equal to the velocity of the fluid. According to typical practice of the present invention s solid body ship motion model disclosed herein the three dimensional ship rotation is governed by the Louisville solid body rotation equation whereby i the dynamic torque from the pressure acts on the ship body surface and ii the buoyancy torque arises from the displacement of the ship from the equilibrium position in water. Similarly the three dimensional ship translation motion is governed by the solid body translation equation whereby i the dynamic force from the pressure acts on the ship body surface and ii the buoyancy force arises from the displacement of the ship from the equilibrium position in water. In the inventive ship motion model a total velocity potential is used to include all linear and nonlinear effects in the dynamical process. No other parameterization such as the added mass and the damping coefficient is employed in the inventive ship motion model. All interactions and thus all forces and torques on the ship body are continuously updated and are used to determine six degree ship motions. With all interactions included the inventive ship motion model can be used for accurately and efficiently evaluating solid body ship motion for very high Froude numbers and very steep incident waves.

The present invention s ship motion model is a fully nonlinear dynamically consistent time varying numerical model that determines six degrees of freedom ship motion fully three dimensional translational and rotational motions under arbitrary ship surface wave interactions. The inventive ship motion model is computationally efficient can be applied to ship design ship construction and ship operation e.g. real time operation can be applied to single hull and multi hull marine vessels in arbitrary water environment calculates forces on ship bodies from the first principles determines ship positions consistently with respect to the environmental surface waves involves mathematical and numerical procedures to accurately and efficiently evaluate the forces and ship positions does not require parameterization on the forces to ship bodies is easily coupled to the present inventors nonlinear steady ship motion model to establish a new framework for ship design engineering and ship operations.

In order to correctly model the ship solid body motion the present invention correctly evaluates various forces on the ship body. Two major forces are determined accurately in accordance with the present invention viz 1 the surface force arising from the non hydrostatic water pressure on ship surface and 2 the buoyancy force arising from ship position departure from the equilibrium state. The translational motion of the ship center of mass and the solid body rotation of the ship about the center of mass are then determined by the net force and the net torque relative to the center of mass. In the present invention s ship motion model all forces and ship positions are evaluated from the first principles no approximation is made in any aspect of modeling except for approximations due to numerical discretization.

U.S. application Ser. No. 11 518 740 focuses upon nonlinear interactions between incident waves and ship bodies. The instant application focuses upon motions of ship bodies considered as solid ship bodies. Unlike other ship motion models the present invention s ship motion model as typically practiced uses one total velocity potential instead of eight velocity potentials. In accordance with typical embodiments of the present invention ship motion under various nonlinear forces is calculated exactly e.g. without any blending from first principles. The inventive ship motion model can determine with consistency the transformations between the ship reference frame centered at the ship mass center and attached to the ship and the surface wave reference frame moving horizontally with the ship translation velocity and centered on the mean surface of the water hence the inventive ship motion model can determine with consistency the ship solid body motion. Provided by the inventive ship motion model is a systematic generic formulation of ship positions including equilibrium state underwater ship surface and volume founded in part on its recognition that accurate force evaluation can best be achieved in the ship reference frame. The inventive ship motion model is capable of correctly modeling ship solid body six degree freedom motions with respect to specified incoming surface waves.

The present inventors two unique models viz. i their ship motion model presently disclosed and ii their ship hydrodynamics model disclosed in their application Ser. No. 11 518 740 can be coupled so as to together constitute a comprehensive framework that is capable of simulating in arbitrary water environment both i ship motion and ii ship wave interaction. The present inventors combination of their presently disclosed ship motion model which simulates ship motions and their previously disclosed ship wave hydrodynamics model which simulates the effects of ship motions e.g. specified steady ship motions on surface waves thus represents a complete framework an inventive hybrid model for simulating all dynamical processes of ships in arbitrary water environment. This inventive framework can be a very useful tool for assisting ship design engineering and real time ship operation. The present invention s fully nonlinear four dimensional three spatial dimensions plus the temporal dimension hybrid ship model includes all nonlinear interactions between the ship and surface waves incident waves and ship generated waves and between the waves themselves.

Typical practice of either or both of the present inventors numerical modeling methodologies implements a computer processing unit and succeeds in finding superior solutions in shorter CPU durations. The present inventors have developed a prototypical computer program product that they have named Digital Self consistent Ship Experimental Laboratory abbreviated DiSSEL. DiSSEL is a prototypical embodiment of the present inventors hybrid model which addresses both ship wave interaction and ship motion. The inventive hybrid model represents a hybridization of their presently disclosed ship motion model which simulates ship motions and their previously disclosed ship wave interaction hydrodynamics model which simulates the effects of ship motions e.g. specified steady ship motions on surface waves . Essentially according to the present inventors DiSSEL model a hybrid algorithm based on spectral finite difference and finite element methods is used to solve the fundamental nonlinear equations that govern the dynamics of surface waves and ship motions. Parameterization that had been assumed in the previous studies on ship motion modeling has been minimized in this inventive model. The DiSSEL model combines two main components viz. ii a fully nonlinear ship wave interaction model DiSSEL SW and coupled therewith ii a six degree ship solid body motion model DiSSEL SB .

According to the DiSSEL SW component of the DiSSEL model the physical processes are described in the reference frame moving horizontally with the mass center of the ship. The corresponding equations in this reference frame are the incompressibility condition 

where circumflex over n is the unit vector of and uis the total ship speed translational and rotational motion speed . It should be pointed out here that we introduce some dissipation in 2 to model wave breaking mechanisms.

The equations are also solved with the radiation boundary conditions to ensure that the ship generated waves are left behind the ship. They are implemented as open boundary conditions away from the ship the far field . In computational applications the far field boundary conditions are defined at a finite distance from the ship instead of the asymptotic limit x 

where b is the forward boundary c are the side and aft boundaries and are the velocity potential and the surface elevation of the environmental waves and are those associated with the ship e.g. ship generated waves and the waves arising from ship environmental wave interactions . The horizontal over bar signifies the spatial average of the quantities. It is pointed out that the boundary conditions are consistent with the mass conservation in calm water and vanish.

The fully nonlinear equations are solved in the computational domain with a pseudo spectral method however on the ship boundary a finite element or a finite difference method is applied. At every time step physical quantities are transferred via a quasi linear method between the ship boundary grids and the spectral collocation points. This inventive approach can achieve computational efficiencies for arbitrary ship hulls.

According to the DiSSEL SB component of the DiSSEL model the six degree of freedom ship solid body motion is divided into i a three degree translational motion of the mass center of the ship and ii a three degree rotation about the mass center of the ship.

The present invention s rotational motion equation also referred to herein as the Louisville equation is 

According to the present inventors DiSSEL the wet surface torque and the body restoring torque are evaluated at each time step via

where xis the geometric center of the underwater ship volume V and are the wetted surfaces with i 4 5 6 for roll pitch and yaw motions respectively. It is pointed out that the fluid viscosity is not included in the present inventors DiSSEL system.

Other objects advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Mathematics and discussion of the inventive ship motion model are presented hereinbelow. The present invention s mathematical formulation is set forth in the section entitled Mathematical Model which contains four subsections respectively entitled Model Reference Frame Fluid Hydrodynamic Equations Solid Body Motion Equations and Coordinate Transformation. The present invention s numerical results particularly as compared with those of experiments for selected cases are treated in the section entitled Benchmark Results. A specific technical example of the present invention is described in the section entitled Roll Damping Example which contains three subsections respectively entitled Relationship between Ship Geometry and Ship Motion Roll Damping Function and Roll Damping Results. Concluding discussion of the present invention is contained in the section entitled Concluding Remarks. 

From general solid body motion theory a ship s movement can be decoupled into a three dimensional translational motion u v of the mass center xof the ship and a three dimensional rotation about x. In this description uis the ship velocity moving in the calm water and vis the wave induced translational ship motion circumflex over z where v v and vare surge sway and heave motions respectively.

Generally speaking there are different choices of reference frames. In the inventive ship motion model the reference frame is determined as follows The origin of the reference frame is on the mean water surface shifted vertically from the ship s center of mass. Therefore the mass center is located at 0 0 z in this reference frame. The x axis passes from the stern to the bow. In addition the reference frame moves horizontally with the ship i.e. with the speed The y coordinate points to the port and the z coordinate is upward. ii Fluid Hydrodynamic Equations

Because the reference frame moves horizontally with the ship and because ship horizontal motion is not assumed steady in our model the acceleration effect is then given by

In the inventive ship motion model the far field radiation conditions as x are approximated on the borders of the computational domain bounded by the forward boundary the side and the aft boundaries . Thus 

As disclosed by their U.S. application Ser. No. 11 518 740 in order to study arbitrary ships in steep incident waves the present inventors use a finite element method on the ship surface boundary and a pseudo spectral method in the global domain. A bi linear interpolation is applied to transfer the information between the finite element meshes and the collocation points. It is emphasized that evaluation of the boundary condition See Equation 5 is a most challenging problem for the present inventors numerical modeling. The ship boundary itself is specified in a different mesh description thus requiring appropriate interpolation for numerical modeling. Further much higher resolution is required to resolve complicated boundary geometries and small scale flow near the boundary . The latter is particular important for accurately modeling interactions between the ship and the surrounding waves. As disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 518 740 a pressure correction is introduced on the ship boundary so that the flow satisfies the boundary condition Equation 5 and does so without any of the mathematical drawbacks confronting other methodologies.

In the inventive ship motion model s reference frame the three dimensional rotation about xis denoted by the angular velocity . Its x y z components are also called roll pitch and yaw respectively. Temporal variation of any point xon the ship boundary is governed by

where is the water density g is the gravity acceleration vector and Vare the wetted surface and underwater volume of the ship respectively.

The solid body rotation is governed by the Louisville equation defined in the reference frame attached to the solid body also referred to herein as the ship reference frame 

where xis the geometric center of the underwater ship volume V. The dissipative coefficients Dand Dare dependent upon ship geometry mass characteristics Froude number incident wavelength etc.

In the inventive ship motion model the forces Fand F and the torques and on the ship are from the interactions between the ship and the waves. They are calculated from the total pressure p on the ship surface and the variation of the ship underwater position. The pressure p is given by Equation 2 . In other words it is determined by the total velocity potential . No parameterization such as added mass or damping coefficients is employed for the inventive calculation. The effect of the ship solid body motion on waves is described by the ship translational velocities u vin Equation 2 Equation 5 Equation 6 and Equation 7 the ship angular velocity is described in Equation 5 . Therefore interactions between the ship and the waves affect not only ship motion but also the surface waves in the domain s of interest.

In order to retain computational efficiency and local resolution near the ship boundary it is often convenient inventive practice to solve the equations of the system in the ship reference frame centered at x . In this reference frame the position vectors are described by where the superscript T means the transpose of the vector. Therefore the relationship between the position vector x in the model reference frame and xis given by . 13 where A is the transformation matrix which can be represented by three Euler angles about the x y z axes respectively 

In general other sets of Euler angles can be used for A as long as no two consecutive angles are defined relative to the same axis see Goldstein et al. supra. Since A is the rotational transformation matrix A A. In the ship reference frame the ship boundary does not vary with time. Therefore time variation of the ship position in the model reference frame is governed by that of the transformation matrix A which by Equation 10 and Equation 13 is of the form

In the inventive ship motion model the time integration of the ship position is carried out as follows Given the Euler angle vector t and the angular velocity t at time t the new transformation matrix A t t is obtained via Equation 15 . The new ship boundary in the model reference frame is then determined by Equation 13 16 All forces and torques are then evaluated with the updated ship boundary in the inventive model reference frame.

For benchmarking of their inventive ship motion model the present inventors selected a ship boat test model viz. Delft Catamaran No. 372. It was designed at Delft University for Army Theater Support Vessel. The specific parameters can be found in Vessel Response VERES Program Users Manual see R. V. Veer Jr. Experimental Results of Motions and Structural Loads on the 372 Catamaran Model in Head and Oblique Waves Report 1130 U.S. Department of Commerce National Technical Information Service Springfield Va. 22161 1998 page 117. Some of the dimensions of the Delft Catamaran model are as follows the overall length is 3.11 m the length between perpendiculars is 3 m the overall beam is 0.94 m the beam of a demi hull is 0.24 m the draught Ap and Fp are each equal to 0.15 m the displacement is 87.07 kg.

First are examined the properties of various forces and torques in Equation 11 and Equation 12 . shows by way of example the non dimensional vertical components of the forces governing the ship heave motion for Delft Catamaran 372 at a Froude number F 0.3. The solid line is the pressure force F and the dashed linear is the buoyancy force F. From one could observe that the two forces tend to offset each other. However due to the phase difference that arises from the delay in the ship response to the incident waves between the two forces they do not cancel exactly each other at any given time. The oscillatory net force induces the ship heave motion oscillation as shown in . Similar properties can be also found in the torques acting on the ship body. Shown in are the non dimensional torques solid line and dashed line for the Delft model Catamaran 372 at F 0.6. The corresponding pitch motion is shown in . In these two examples the incident wave length is 1.6 times the ship length L.

The present inventors benchmark the inventive ship motion model with respect to experimentation and some existing ship models. For this purpose the ship Catamaran No. 372 is selected for various Froude numbers and incident wave lengths. As shown in through the inventive ship motion model results are indicated by the solid lines the VERES model results are indicated by the dashed lines the experimental results from the MARIN Model test are indicated by the triangular dotted lines and the Delft Model test results are indicated by the circular dotted lines.

The benchmarking results for F 0.45 are shown in and . The results for the heave motions shown in agree well. Some discrepancies are found however in the results of the pitch motion shown in . In particular when the wavelength of the incident waves is comparable to the ship length the pitch motion amplitude from VERES is 30 percent greater than that measured in the experiment. Nevertheless the results from the inventive ship motion model agree well with the experiment.

The benchmarking tests illustrated in through more manifestly demonstrate superiority of the inventive ship motion model as compared with the VERES implementation of existing ship motion models. and show the results for F 0.6. In this case one clearly observes the significant differences between the VERES results and the experimental data. Notwithstanding the coupling of the pitch and heave motions the differences between the numerical model results and experimental data for these two motions may not match. It is therefore appropriate to separately address the errors of these two motions. For the heave motion the VERES results are generally about 15 20 percent different from the experiments. The difference for the pitch motion is generally even larger that is the amplitude from VERES is approximately 45 percent larger than that from the experiments. In contrast the difference between the inventive ship motion model results and the experimental results are seen to be negligible in both and .

For larger Froude numbers the differences between VERES and the experiments increase with the Froude number F. When Froude numbers are larger one also begins to observe differences between the inventive ship motion model results and the experimental data. Nevertheless even when the inventive ship motion model results and the experimental measurements appreciably differ the difference between the inventive ship motion model results and the experimental measurements is much smaller than that between the VERES results and the experimental results. This is clearly demonstrated for F 0.75 as shown in and . From one observes that the relative difference between the VERES results and the experimental results for the pitch motion is approximately 70 percent in contrast the relative difference of the inventive ship motion model results is approximately 10 15 percent.

Roll motion is one of the most important ship responses to waves and is very difficult to predict due to the complexity of ship wave interaction and the sensitivity thereof to ship bilge keels and appendages. This sensitivity needs special attention both in modeling corresponding physical processes and in numerical treatment. One important process in this regard is the roll damping. Without an appropriate roll damping model accurate prediction of ship roll motion is inconceivable.

There have been several theoretical and experimental attempts to model the roll damping in the past. G. H. Bryan 1900 was perhaps one of the first researchers to study the bilge keel s effect. Forty years later R. W. L. Gawn 1940 made a significant contribution with his studies on roll damping in still water. Later T. Hishida 1952 1954 1955 provided a theoretical model on the roll damping for ship hulls in simple oscillatory waves. M. Martin 1958 N. Tanaka 1957 1958 1959 1961 H. Kato 1965 C. G. Moody 1961 L. E. Motter 1967 and H. Jones 1978 1979 provided experimental results on the bilge keels effect. Several efforts tried to address the effect of ship speed on roll damping. Y. Watanabe and S. Inoue 1957 first tested the roll damping effect at zero ship speed. Later Y. Yamanouchi 1961 W. E. Bolton 1972 and R. F. Lofft 1973 tested the damping with finite forward ship speed. Their findings as well as many others showed that there are considerable differences between the experimental data and the existing theoretical results. With the linear strip theory Y. Himeno 1981 improved the theoretical model with his roll damping coefficients which have to date been widely used. However as Himeno himself acknowledged the roll damping process is still not fully understood. One reason that understanding of the roll damping effect is hindered is the nonlinear interaction between ship body and surrounding fluid including waves . This nonlinear interaction affects not only ship motion but also and perhaps more importantly as discussed hereinbelow the underwater ship volume.

Appropriate modeling of roll damping is one of the key issues in accurately predicting ship roll motion. The difficulties in modeling roll damping arise mainly from the nonlinear nature of the phenomenon. Roll damping depends strongly on the nonlinear waves incident waves and ship motion generated waves and on the interactions among the waves and between the waves and the ship body. In addition roll damping depends strongly on the underwater geometry of the ship. The underwater geometry changes over time because a ship water line defined in calm water does not apply to a moving ship rather its underwater volume depends on ship motion speed and on the interactions between the ship body and surrounding waves.

The present inventors have derived a better roll damping model from the basic equations of fluid motions. Their new dynamically consistent bilge keels roll damping function reduces the effect of the empirical or linear parameters. In a general context a flow passing by a solid object is different from that without the object as can be observed from different streamlines of flow. This difference is often called by geophysicists the blocking effect of the object on the flow. There is a long history of studying blocking mechanisms in a wide variety of fluid systems. In this study the present inventors use the term blocking effect for the net pressure force on the surface. The inventive approach in this regard is based on the studies of the blocking mechanisms of an object in potential flow. The interaction of a ship body with the surrounding flow possesses similar physical characteristics however this situation is much more challenging because the underwater ship geometry e.g. the solid object interacting with the flow changes in time. This change depends on the interaction as well. Still the potential benefit of this inventive approach is great as the derived damping function is independent of the ship hull. According to this inventive approach the hull geometry effect is described explicitly by a variable in the function so are other environmental conditions such as sheep motion state incident waves and wave breaking mechanisms.

In a linear parameterized model the underwater ship geometry is assumed unchanged in determining ship responding motion see A. R. Magee and R. F. Beck 1988 page 192. In reality the underwater geometry does change according to the ship s solid body motion. In accordance with the present inventors modeling methodology such change is naturally incorporated its effect on ship motion and on ship wave interaction can be identified in the inventive numerical results. The impact of time varying underwater ship geometry on ship motion is isolated as explained hereinbelow.

It is well known that the response of a solid body to external forcing is strongest when the forcing frequency resonates with the intrinsic or natural frequency of the solid body. The ship intrinsic frequencies in water can be determined similarly as for a pendulum. Given an initial ship position in calm water that is away from its equilibrium position it will oscillate rotate or move vertically according to the buoyancy force e.g. the restoring forces in Equation 11 and Equation 12 . In numerical simulation the responses are described by a time series of related quantities e.g. velocity potential or rotating angles . The intrinsic frequency can be obtained from the time series via Fourier transform.

The whole ship geometry not only the part below the water line is necessary to correctly determine the natural frequencies of the ship under consideration. To demonstrate this numerically the present inventors selected two ship hulls viz. the ONR tumblehome hull and the ONR flared hull . The respective geometries of the two hulls under the calm water line are identical but their respective geometries above water are different. Above the calm water line the sidewall of the tumblehome hull tilts 10 inward as depicted in and the sidewall of the flared hull tilts 10 outward as depicted in .

Linearized ship motion models would yield the same intrinsic frequencies for the tumblehome hull and the flared hull as the underwater line geometries are identical. However the inventive ship motion model results indicate otherwise since the inventive ship motion takes the entire ship geometry into consideration. The intrinsic roll frequencies of the two hulls are shown in tumblehome hull and flared hull . From and one can observe clearly that the intrinsic frequency of the tumblehome hull is lower than that of the flared hull. Without correct intrinsic frequencies one would not be able to correctly determine ship responses to external forcing on the ship. These numerical results hence demonstrate that the complete ship geometry is important for correct modeling ship motion in particular near the resonant conditions.

Real and experimental ship hulls often include appendages such as bilge keels rudders etc. The appendages produce roll damping that can reduce ship roll motions by as much as 10 20 . It is thus important that roll damping be implemented into numerical models. See Y. Himeno Report No. 239 Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering University of Michigan Ann Arbor Mich. September 1981.

To balance numerical accuracy and efficiency naval architects have developed many simple parameterized roll damping models. For example Himeno 1981 suggested the following linearized roll damping coefficient dot over dot over 17 The roll damping function B dot over is linearly proportional to the rotation rate dot over with a constant damping coefficient B. Himeno 1981 also suggested a more sophisticated coefficient for simple oscillation with a frequency 

According to an earlier approach by the present inventors the roll damping coefficient is determined by the difference of the two adjacent wave peaks or valleys of the free roll oscillation with a finite initial departing angle in calm water. An example of such oscillation is shown in . Nevertheless this approach though simple and nonlinear in nature and thus better than linearized results is itself limited in its failure to account for possible dependencies of the coefficient on roll oscillation frequency. This could create serious problems when ships are not in calm water. In more realistic situations ships roll with a wide spectrum of frequencies. The damping coefficient derived from a single intrinsic frequency is simply not sufficient.

This has prompted the present inventors to search for a more realistic approach to model roll damping effect. Various aspects of existing methodologies are incorporated into the present invention s approach. For instance the inventive approach borrows a notion from the classical analysis of blocking effect of a solid object in a flow see L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz Butterworth and Heinemann Ch. 6 page 539 1999 . This approach has been applied to many fluid systems e.g. an object in stratified fluid D. D. Freund and R. E. Meyer On the Mechanism of Blocking in a Stratified Fluid . Vol. 54 pp 719 744 1972 wind past a two dimensional terrain S. T. Garner Blocking and Frontogenesis by Two Dimensional Terrain in Baroclinic Flow. Part II Analysis of Flow Stagnation Mechanisms 56 pp 1509 1523 1998 and current past seamount Ray Qing Lin and W. L. Thomas III Ship Stability Study in the Coastal Region New Coastal Wave Model Coupled with a Dynamic Stability Model Twenty Third Symposium on Naval Hydrodynamics Val De Reuil France 17 22 Sep. 2000 National Academy of Sciences Press 2001 . Bilge keels on ship hulls play a role similar to a seamount in the ocean. This suggests to the present inventors the importation of elements for the problem being addressed by the present invention. However the present problem differs from the seamount problem insofar as in the present problem the underwater parts of the bilge keels e.g. two bilge keels vary in time as the ship moves in water.

The inventive approach does not solve the present problem directly via numerical model for the fundamental equations of the fluid mechanics . Instead the inventive approach is quasi analytical in nature in that certain simplified mathematical formulations are used to derive the damping function. The price paid by the inventive approach as it is frequently embodied is that not all nonlinear damping effects are included. To include the fully nonlinear effects of the appendages according to inventive practice one could use a coupled system such as the present invention s nonlinear ship motion model coupled with a fully nonlinear viscous flow model e.g. RANS however this can be computationally very time consuming or even impractical.

According to the inventive approach generally the roll damping can be evaluated from the torque arising from the pressure acting on the blocking area 

To avoid such difficulties the present inventors borrow the following idea from previous studies of blocking mechanisms The blocking effect can be included by deducting an effective blocking area A not in Equation 19 from the ship wet surface in the integral for the torques on the ship body 

There is no existing result on modeling W. Therefore the present inventors start from the physical intuition and typical approaches in nonlinear theory. Intuitively one could argue that the larger the rolling angle and the faster the oscillation the larger the effective blocking area. This implies that in the simplest form W c 23 where is the rolling angle magnitude and is the rolling frequency. On the other hand general multi scale analysis C. M. Bender and S. A. Orzag Chapter 1 starting page 593 Asymptotic Methods and Perturbation Theory Springer N.Y. 1972 demonstrates that nonlinear effects can be modeled by adding higher order terms as the power of 2n in Equation 23 

Since the roll motions are in general more complicated than a simple oscillation there is a wide spectrum of oscillating frequencies. These frequencies are often related to those of external forcing. In this application of the present invention the external forcing is provided by incident waves. To properly account for the contributions from individual oscillating modes the present inventors replace the single frequency in Equation 24 with a weighted distribution over the incident wave frequency domain 

In the present inventors analysis K 3 is chosen. Of course K can be chosen differently in other applications. Generally the principle is that K should be larger for stronger nonlinearity but there is no established theory for selecting an optimal K. The coefficients cin the expansion Equation 23 depend on the nonlinearity of the physical problem e.g. the nonlinear equations of the system . It decreases as k increases.

From Equation 24 we can observe that the coefficient cdescribes the nonlinear effect of the mode which is proportional to is the typical magnitude of . However we set the coefficients to be normalized in our study i.e. 

The formulation Equation 24 of Ais generic that is it is derived without any assumption on ship and environment properties. Therefore it can be applied to arbitrary ships in arbitrary environment. The coefficients care constants because of our normalization assumption. Therefore the rolling angle in Equation 24 depends on the ship body characteristics the ship motion state e.g. speed rotation and the environment e.g. incident waves ship motion generated waves kinematics dissipation and wave breaking processes .

It is pointed out again that since it depends on many characteristics must be determined via solving a coupled ship motion surface wave system. This is what the present inventors accomplish in their experimental numerical simulations that they style DiSSEL previously discussed herein. DiSSEL represents a synthesis of their inventive ship models. The DiSSEL SW component of DiSSEL models fully nonlinear ship wave interactions. The DiSSEL SB component of DiSSEL models six degree ship solid body motions. In terms of its computations the DiSSEL prototype can be summarized as follows First an initial state is estimated from the peak of the incident wave in the ship coordinate . Then the full system without the bilge keels is solved from the initial state via numerical time integration. The simulation stops when the system reaches to a well developed dynamically stable state. The rolling angle amplitude is then determined from the stable state.

The effective blocking area Ais in general larger than the real blocking area . In the inventive model the additional area is added in the down stream side of the bilge keels. Since the roll motion is oscillating with time therefore the down stream is oscillating with time. Therefore both the size and the location of Aare well defined. The expansion Equation 17 is consistent in format with other approaches in modeling solid body motion with damping effects see E. Kreyszig John Wiley and Sons New York 1983 p 988.

It is pointed out that the roll damping is strongly associated with the time varying underwater geometry. For example Wdecreases as the bilge keels rise above the water an extreme case is that W 0 when the bilge keels are completely above water.

To examine the present inventors damping function model described hereinabove the present inventors used their DiSSEL ship motion model to study roll motion of two ONR form ship hulls viz. tumblehome hull and flared hull. As previously described herein the present inventors DiSSEL ship motion model includes two components viz. DiSSEL SW and DiSSEL SB. The ship wave interaction is modeled in the DiSSEL SW component. Ship solid body motion under the influence of the interaction is modeled in the DiSSEL SB component.

The tumblehome hull and the flared hull were selected by the present inventors for these studies because these two hulls have different above waterline geometries the waterline being defined in calm water and because of the availability of experimental data in the David Taylor Model Basin DTMB laboratory West Bethesda Md. to use for benchmarking the present invention s numerical results. The two problems that the present inventors focused upon in these studies of the bilge keels roll damping effect were i the impact of above calm water line ship hull geometry on roll motion and ii the blocking effect of the bilge keel. The present inventors used their DiSSEL ship motion model to test the significance of their roll damping function in predicting ship roll motion. Their numerical experiment demonstrates clearly that the implementation of this roll damping component improves significantly the accuracy of numerical model results as compared with the ship experiment data from the NSWCCD Maneuvering and Seakeeping Facility.

Illustrated in through are the numerical results of the tumblehome hull roll motion in a regular beam sea impinging on the starboard side of the ship. In and respectively the wave amplitude is 2.23 m and 6.5 m. In both cases the incident wavelength Lis twice the ship length L i.e. L L 2. The other parameters are the same as well Fn 0.066 h 1.25 m L 102.67 m the full length . The present inventors calculated the roll motion with dashed lines and without solid lines the bilge keels. As demonstrated in the numerical results the bilge keel s blocking effect on the roll motion is very significant. It is clearly observed from that the roll amplitude is reduced by as much as 20 when the bilge keels blocking effects are included. The reduction increases significantly with the incident wave amplitude as shown in . This implies that the bilge keels overall blocking effect is stronger for larger incident wave amplitudes. It is clearly seen in that the blocking effect changes the roll motion frequencies as well.

This finding in rolling wave frequency change prompted the present inventors to investigate further the blocking effect with different incident wavelengths. In are the roll motion results for 2.5. The wave amplitude is 2.845 m slightly larger than that in . The other parameters remain the same. The present inventors numerical results show that the reduction in is obviously smaller than that shown in . This result that the reduction is smaller with larger wave amplitudes seemed contradictory to our earlier conclusion however this contradiction really indicates the importance of the resonance in the blocking effect. The wavelength in is closer to the intrinsic frequency of the tumblehome shown in and thus is closer to the resonance. On the other hand the wavelength in is further away from the resonant frequency. Therefore the smaller reduction in indicates that the blocking effect will increase significantly when closer to the resonance. To further test this the present inventors evaluated the ship roll motion with the same conditions as those in but with a smaller 1.75. The results are shown in . From these figures we can observe that the blocking effect in is slightly stronger than that in consistent with the present inventors earlier conclusions. Therefore the numerical results suggest that the bilge keel s blocking effect is stronger for larger wave amplitude with a given wavelength and is stronger when the incident wavelength is closer to the hull intrinsic frequencies.

The inventive damping function is also benchmarked with experimental data. The present inventors calculated the roll motions of the tumblehome and flared hulls with various incident wavelengths or the normalized wavelength . These numerical results in terms of the normalized roll motion amplitude versus are summarized in . In these tests h 1.25 m and Fn 0.066. In the solid line represents the numerical rolling angles of the tumblehome hull and the dashed line represents the numerical rolling angles of the flared hull. The corresponding experimental data are in squares and circular dots for the two hulls respectively. From it is clearly observed that the numerical results agree well with the experimental data. It is also noticed from that the tumblehome hull roll angles are much larger than those of the flared hull under the same conditions. The difference is the largest when equals the resonant value in which case the roll angle of the tumblehome hull nearly doubles that of the flared hull. shows the roll motion of the tumblehome hull as it varies with time in full scale where L L 2.25 and incident wave amplitude 2.84 meters. This roll motion is associated with the solid line in the resonant area as shown in .

The convergence of the numerical solutions can be tested by the distribution of the spectral coefficients of the physical variables e.g. the velocity potential with respect to the discrete expansion wave numbers k k in the x y axes. To show the convergence plotted in and are the distributions of the spectral coefficients of the velocity potential of the solution in at t 23s in the k k spectral space. Shown in are the distributions of in kfor different k while shown in are the distributions in kfor different k. From and one can find that the spectral coefficient decreases by more than 10 orders of magnitude from small wave numbers k k to the maximum wave numbers in the expansion. For example the coefficient for the wave numbers k k 0.0164 0.0164 is twelve orders of magnitude greater than that for k k 1.0308 1.0308 . In particular the decrease is monotonic except at very large values of k however in latter cases the magnitude is very small beyond the accuracy of the computing systems. Therefore the convergence of the numerical solutions is quite satisfactory.

Presented in the instant disclosure is an inventive algorithm on the ship solid body motion driven interactions between the ship and waves including incidental waves . The inventive ship motion model is fully nonlinear that is no linearization is introduced in its modeling of ship position wave wave and ship wave interactions. All forces on ship bodies are fully implemented in the inventive ship motion model neither linearization nor parameterization is introduced in the inventive ship motion model with the exception of dissipative effect due to wave breaking.

The present inventors tested the inventive ship motion model using the Delft Catamaran No. 372 ship boat test model. The benchmark results for heave and pitch motions illustrated in through demonstrate that the present invention s ship motion model agrees well with experiments for various Froude numbers F. The results also show that the inventive ship motion model is more accurate than the linear models especially when the Froude number is large. The nonlinear effects are especially significant for steep incident waves and or large Froude numbers. The results of the inventive ship motion model results are demonstrably much closer to experimental results than are the results from linearized models nevertheless small differences are still observed between the inventive ship motion model results and experimental data for very large Froude numbers. These discrepancies may be partly attributable to numerical errors introduced in mapping finite different ship body grids to pseudo spectral grids.
