The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and combinations for treating preventing or managing pulmonary hypertension comprising small molecule heterocyclic pharmaceuticals and more particularly substituted pyridines and pyridazines optionally combined with at least one additional therapeutic agent.

Substituted pyridines and pyridazines as mentioned in the present invention are described in WO 01 023375 for treating abnormal angiogenesis or hyperpermeability processes which are linked to cancer.

Pulmonary hypertension refers to a disease characterized by sustained elevations of pulmonary artery pressure L. J. Rubin The New England Journal of Medicine 1997 336 2 111 . Current treatment of pulmonary hypertension depends on the stage and the mechanism of the disease. Typical treatments for pulmonary hypertension include anticoagulation oxygen supplementation conventional vasodilator therapy transplantation and surgical care. Therapeutic agents presently used for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension include e.g. calcium channel blockers and pulmonary vasodilators

The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions for treating preventing or managing pulmonary hypertension comprising a compound of formula I and optionally at least one further therapeutic agent.

The present invention can be used e.g. by administering a compound of formula I and optionally a further therapeutic agent pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and derivatives thereof etc.

The compounds with the structure of formula I pharmaceutically acceptable salts polymorphs solvates hydrates metabolites and prodrugs thereof including diastereoisomeric forms both isolated stereoisomers and mixtures of stereoisomers are collectively referred to herein as the compounds of formula I .

In its broadest aspect the present invention relates to the sum of three sets of chemical compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof with each set overlapping the others in scope. The generalized structural formula for the compounds in each of the three sets of compounds is the same but it should be noted that the definitions of the several groups comprising the general structure in each set differ somewhat. Thus the defined sets of chemical compounds differ from each other but overlap in their scopes.

The compounds of the invention may be prepared by use of known chemical reactions and procedures. Nevertheless the following general preparative methods are presented to aid the reader in synthesizing the KDR inhibitors with more detailed particular examples being presented below in the experimental section describing the working examples.

All variable groups of these methods are as described in the generic description if they are not specifically defined below. When a variable group or substituent with a given symbol i.e. R R R G G G or G is used more than once in a given structure it is to be understood that each of these groups or substituents may be independently varied within the range of definitions for that symbol. As defined above the compounds of the invention contain ring units each of which may independently bear between 0 and 5 substituents G G or G which are not defined as H. By contrast it is to be noted that in the general method schemes below the G G or Gsubstituents are used as if their definition includes H to show where such G G or Gsubstituents may exist in the structures and for ease in drawing. No change in the definition of G G or Gis intended by this non standard usage however. Thus only for purposes of the general method schemes below G G or Gmay be H in addition to the moieties set forth in the definitions of G G or G. The ultimate compounds contain 0 to 5 non hydrogen groups G G or G.

It is recognized that compounds of the invention with each claimed optional functional group cannot be prepared with each of the below listed methods. Within the scope of each method optional substituents are used which are stable to the reaction conditions or the functional groups which may participate in the reactions are present in protected form where necessary and the removal of such protective groups is completed at appropriate stages by methods well known to those skilled in the art.

General Method A The compounds of formula I A in which X M and Qare defined as above Y is CH O CH S CH NH O S or NH and Rand Rtogether with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused 5 membered ring aromatic heterocycle hal is halogen Cl Br F or I but preferably Cl Br or F are conveniently prepared according to a reaction sequence as shown in Method A. Thus a heterocycle of formula II in which R is lower alkyl can be made by one skilled in the art according to the corresponding published procedures in the reference table. In the cases of thiophene 2 3 dicarboxylic acid table entry 1 and pyrazole 3 4 dicarboxylic acid table entry 10 the carboxylic acids are converted to methyl or ethyl esters by treatment with the corresponding alcohol and catalytic mineral acid typically sulfuric acid at reflux. The diester of formula II is treated with hydrazine hydrate to furnish intermediate III for specific reaction conditions see Robba M. Le Guen Y. 1970 12 4317 . Compound III is treated with a halogenating agent such as phosphorous oxychloride phosphorous oxybromide phosphorous pentabromide or phosphorous pentachloride to yield dihalo intermediate IV. The dichloro or dibromo intermediates can be converted to the difluoro intermediate when desired by reaction with hydrogen fluoride. By using iodo reagents such as potassium iodide or tetrabutyl ammonium iodide in subsequent steps the iodo intermediate is formed in the reaction mixtures without being isolated as a pure substance. Dihalo intermediate IV is treated with a nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol or other suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran THF dimethoxyethane DME dimethylformamide DMF dimethylsulfoxide DMSO or the like to furnish the intermediate of formula VI. Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HCl or bases such as triethylamine or 1 8 diazobicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene DBU . The compound of formula VI is reacted with compounds of formula VII in a suitable aprotic solvent such as DMSO DMF or solvent free often with a basic catalyst such as DBU or CsCO or a crown ether such as 18 crown 6 at temperatures usually between room temperature and reflux to furnish invention compound of formula I A. It is understood that the nature of the starting materials will dictate the choice of suitable solvents catalyst if used and temperature by one skilled in the art. Intermediates of formula V and VII are often commercial or are conveniently prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example see Martin I. et al. 1995 49 230 for the preparation of VII in which Y is CH O and Qis 4 pyridyl substituted by a 2 aminocarbonyl group 2 CONH .

General Method B The compounds of formula I B in which M X and Qare as defined above and Y is CH O CH S CH NH O S or NH are conveniently prepared as shown in Method B.

Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HCl or bases such as triethylamine or 1 8 diazobicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene DBU . The compound of formula X is reacted with compounds of formula VII in a suitable aprotic solvent such as DMSO DMF or solvent free often with a basic catalyst such as DBU or CsCOat elevated temperatures to furnish invention compound of formula I B. This method is most useful when Y is C S or S .

In this method m is preferably 0 and Rand Rtogether with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused benzene or fused 5 member ring aromatic heterocycle. Starting material XI is either commercial or is prepared by one skilled in the art as shown in the reference table below. Starting material XI is reacted with urea or ammonia usually at elevated temperature and pressure in the case of ammonia to form imide XII. The imide is reacted with an aldehyde XIII in acetic acid and piperidine at reflux to yield intermediate XIV. Reaction of XIV with sodium borohydride in methanol or other suitable solvents according to the general procedure described by I. W. Elliott and Y. Takekoshi 1976 13 597 yields intermediate XV. Treatment of XV with a suitable halogenating agent such as POCl POBr PCl PBror thionyl chloride yields halo intermediate XVI which is reacted with nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol to furnish invention compound of formula I C. Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HCl or bases such as triethylamine or 1 8 diazobicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene DBU . Alternatively reagent V can be condensed with intermediate XV be heating the two components with POin a melt to yield invention compound of structure I C. This last method is especially effective when X is an amine linker.

Thus pyridine substituted pyridazines or pyridines I D 1 are functionalized into substituted 2 aminocarbonyl pyridines of formula I D 2 by the use of formamides XVII in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and iron salts according to a procedure described in the literature Minisci et al. 1985 41 4157 . This method works best when Rand Rtogether constitute a fused aromatic heterocycle or fused aromatic carbocycle. In those cases that Z is CH and Rand Rdo not form a fused aromatic an isomeric side product in which Z is CCONHRcan be formed and if so formed is removed from the desired product by chromatography.

General Method E The compounds of formula I E 1 and I E 2 in which R R R M X Y G and Z are defined as above q is 0 or 1 and Ris lower alkyl are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method E.

Compounds of formula I E 1 in which Ris H are then formed by hydrolysis of the ester with a base such as sodium hydroxide in methanol water. Compounds of formula I E 2 in which the Rgroups are independently defined as above but especially including those compounds in which neither Ris H are conveniently prepared from the acid I E 1 R H by treatment with amine XIX in the presence of a coupling agent such as DCC dicyclohexylcarbodiimide . This method works best when Rand Rtogether constitute a fused aromatic heterocycle or fused aromatic carbocycle. In those cases that Z is CH and Rand Rdo not form a fused aromatic an isomeric side product in which Z is CCORcan be formed in the first step and if so formed is removed from the desired product by chromatography.

General Method F The compounds of formula I F in which M Qand X are defined as above m is an integer of 1 5 and Rand Rtogether with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused 5 membered ring aromatic heterocycle can be prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in method F. The readily available heterocyclylcarboxylic acid starting material XX is reacted with butyl lithium followed by dimethylformamide to yield the aldehyde with structure XXI. Reaction of XXI with hydrazine yields pyridazinone XXII. Treatment of XXII with a suitable halogenating agent such as POCl POBr PCl PBror thionyl chloride yields a halo intermediate which is reacted with nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol to furnish intermediate compound of formula XXIII. Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HCl or bases such as triethylamine or 1 8 diazobicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene DBU . Alternatively reagent V can be condensed with intermediate XXII be heating the two components with POin a melt to yield XXII. This last method is especially effective when X is an amine linker. Formation and alkylation of the Reissert compound XXIII with halide XXIV is done as described by the general method of F. D. Popp 1980 14 1033 to yield the intermediate of structure XXV. Treatment of XXV with base then yields invention compound I F.

General Method G The compounds of formula I G in which M Qand X are defined as above m is an integer of 1 4 and Rand Rtogether with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused 5 membered ring aromatic heterocycle can be prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in method G. Aldehyde XXI from method F can be reduced with sodium borohydride to yield a hyroxyacid which is lactonized using methods well known to those skilled in the art such as with toluenesulfonyl chloride to yield lactone XXVI. Condensation of intermediate XXVI with aldehyde XIII in the presence of a base such as sodium methoxide usually in a solvent such as methanol under reflux yields an intermediate of structure XXVII. Reaction of XXVII with hydrazine or preferably with hydrazine hydrate at a temperature of 100 150 C. leads to an intermediate of structure XXVIII. Conversion of intermediate XXVIII to invention compound of structure I G is done by methods as described in method C by using XXVIII rather than XV.

General Method H The compounds of formula I H in which the R R M X R q and Gare defined as above are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method H. Thus the methods described in Martin I Anvelt J. Vares L. Kuehn I. Claesson A. 1995 49 230 232 or those of methods D or E above by substituting readily available pyridine 4 carboxylic ester XXX for I D 1 are used to convert XXX into XXXI. Reduction of the ester as described by Martin et al. above is next done with a mild reducing agent such as NaBHsuch that the amide substituent is left unchanged to yield alcohol XXXII. This alcohol is then heated with a base such as DBU or CsCOwith halopyridazine VI from method A under anhydrous conditions to yield the invention compound with formula I H.

General Method I Invention compounds having formula I I in which the R R M X R q and Gare defined as above and W is a bond or CH are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method I. This method is especially useful when q is 1 and XXXIII is 4 chloropyridine. Alternatively other 4 halopyridines such as 4 fluoropyridine or 4 bromopyridine can be used in this process. Thus readily available 4 halopyridines XXXIII are converted to intermediates of formula XXXIV by using the general procedures of methods D or E above by substituting the 4 halopyridine for I D 1. Reaction of XXXIV with either potassium or sodium hydrogen sulfide yields a thiol having formula XXXV. Alternatively the alcohol function of intermediate XXXII from method H is converted to a leaving group by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride and a suitable base such as triethylamine in the cold such that polymeric material formation is minimized and the resultant intermediate is reacted with either potassium or sodium hydrogen sulfide to yield a thiol having formula XXXVI.

The expected side products consisting of mixtures of various N oxides and the sulfone I J 2 can be removed by chromatography. The sulfone I J 2 is obtained by the use of an additional equivalent of MCPBA or preferably by use of potassium permanganate in acetic acid water Eur. J. Med. Chem. Ther. 21 1 5 8 1986 or by use of hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid Chem. Heterocycl. Compd. 15 1085 1088 1979 . In those cases that unwanted N oxides become a significant product they can be converted back to the desired sulfoxides or sulfones by hydrogenation in ethanol acetic acid with palladium on carbon catalysts Yakugaku Zasshi 69 545 548 1949 Chem.

The crude diacid of formula XXXVII is subsequently treated with hydrazine to furnish pyridazinone XXXVIII for specific reaction conditions see Vaughn W. R. Baird S. L. J. 1946 68 1314 . Pyridazinone XXXVIII is treated with a chlorinating agent such as phosphorous oxychloride to yield an intermediate dichloro species which undergoes hydrolysis upon aqueous workup to furnish chloropyridazine XXXIX. Chloro acid XXXIX is treated with a nucleophile of formula V in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as DMF or in the absence of a solvent. The resultant acid XXXX is reduced with a reducing agent such as BH.THF according to the procedure of Tilley J. W. Coffen D. L. Schaer B. H. Lind J. 1987 52 2469.

The thiol is then reacted with 4 halopyridine XXXXII from method K in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine to yield invention compound I K. Alternatively XXXXI is converted to halo intermediate of formula XXXXIV by methods well known to those skilled in the art and the halide is reacted with thiol XXXXV to yield I K.

The following list is the 2003 classification proposed at the Third World Conference on Pulmonary Hypertension PAH IPAH FPAH collagen vascular disease congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts large small repaired or nonrepaired Portal hypertension drugs and toxins other glycogen storage disease gaucher disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia hemoglobinopathies myeloproliferative disorders splenectomy associated with significant venous or capillary involvement pulmonary venous hypertension pulmonary capillary heman giomatosis pulmonary venous hypertension left sided atrial ventricular heart disease left sided valvular heart disease pulmonary hypertension associated with hypoxemia COPD interstitial lung disease sleep disordered breathing alveolar hypoventilation disorders chronic exposure to high altitude PH due to chronic thrombotic and or embolic disease thromboembolic obstruction of proximal pulmonary arteries thromboembolic obstruction of distal pulmonary arteries pulmonary embolism tumor parasites foreign material sarcoidosis histiocytosis X lymphangiomatosis compression of pulmonary vessels adenopathy tumor fibrosing mediastinitis 

Any of the above mentioned disorders can be associated with an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension including subjects having e.g. congenital heart disease e.g. Eisenmenger syndrome left heart disease pulmonary venous disease e.g. fibrosis tissue narrowing or occluding pulmonary veins and venules pulmonary arterial disease diseases causing alveolar hypoxia fibrotic lung diseases Williams syndrome subjects with intravenous drug abuse injury pulmonary vasculitis such as Wegener s Goodpasture s and Churg Strauss syndromes emphysema chronic bronchitis kyphoscoliosis cystic fibrosis obesity hyper ventilation and sleep apnea disorders pulmonary fibrosis sarcoidosis silocosis CREST calcinosis cutis Raynaud phenomenon esophageal motility disorder sclerodactyl and teleangiectasia and other connective tissue diseases. For example a subject who possesses a BMPR2 mutation bone morphogenetic protein receptor II has a 10 20 lifetime risk of acquiring FPAH. Subjects with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasa were also identified as being at risk for IPAH especially those carrying mutations in ALK1. See McGoon et al. 2004 126 14 34.

According to the invention the term treating refers to the administration of a pharmaceutical composition after the onset of symptoms of pulmonary hypertension whereas preventing refers to the administration prior to the onset of symptoms particularly to patients at risk of pulmonary hypertension. The term managing encompasses preventing the recurrence of pulmonary hypertension in a patient who suffered from pulmonary hypertension.

Compounds or drug combinations of the present invention can be administered in any form by any effective route including e.g. oral parenteral enteral intravenous intraperitoneal topical transdermal e.g. using any standard patch ophthalmic nasally local non oral such as aerosol inhalation subcutaneous intramuscular buccal sublingual rectal vaginal intra arterial and intrathecal etc. They can be administered alone or in combination with any ingredient s active or inactive.

Compounds or drug combinations of the present invention can be converted in a known manner into the usual formulations which may be liquid or solid formulations e.g. without limitation normal and enteric coated tablets capsules pills powders granules elixirs tinctures solution suspensions syrups solid and liquid aerosols and emulsions.

Examples of solid formulations for oral administration are described in U.S. provisional application No. 60 605 752.

The combinations of the present invention can be administered at any time and in any effective form. For example the compounds can be administered simultaneously e.g. as a single composition or dosage unit e.g. a pill or liquid containing both compositions or they can be administered as separate compositions but at the same time e.g. where one drug is administered intravenously and the other is administered orally or intramuscularly . The drugs can also be administered sequentially at different times. Agents can be formulated conventionally to achieve the desired rates of release over extended period of times e.g. 12 hours 24 hours. This can be achieved by using agents and or their derivatives which have suitable metabolic half lives and or by using controlled release formulations.

The drug combinations can be synergistic e.g. where the joint action of the drugs is such that the combined effect is greater than the algebraic sum of their individual effects. Thus reduced amounts of the drugs can be administered e.g. reducing toxicity or other deleterious or unwanted effects and or using the same amounts as used when the agents are administered alone but achieving greater efficacy.

Compounds or drug combinations of the present invention can be further combined with any other suitable additive or pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such additives include any of the substances already mentioned as well as any of those used conventionally such as those described in Gennaro and Gennaro eds 20th edition Lippincott Williams Wilkins 2000 Lachman et al. eds. 3rd edition Lippincott Williams Wilkins 1986 Swarbrick and Boylan eds. 2nd edition Marcel Dekker 2002 . These can be referred to herein as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to indicate they are combined with the active drug and can be administered safely to a subject for therapeutic purposes.

In addition compounds or drug combinations of the present invention can be administered with other active agents or other therapies that are utilized to treat any of the above mentioned diseases and or conditions.

The present invention provides also combinations of at least one compound of Formula I and at least one other therapeutic agent mentioned above useful in treating a disease or disorder. Combinations for the purposes of the invention include 

The dosage of each agent of the combination can be selected with reference to the other and or the type of disease and or the disease status in order to provide the desired therapeutic activity. For example the active agents in the combination can be present and administered in a fixed combination. Fixed combination is intended here to mean pharmaceutical forms in which the components are present in a fixed ratio that provides the desired efficacy. These amounts can be determined routinely for a particular patient where various parameters are utilized to select the appropriate dosage e.g. type of disease age of patient disease status patient health weight etc. or the amounts can be relatively standard.

The amount of the administered active ingredient can vary widely according to such considerations as the particular compound and dosage unit employed the mode and time of administration the period of treatment the age sex and general condition of the patient treated the nature and extent of the condition treated the rate of drug metabolism and excretion the potential drug combinations and drug drug interactions and the like.

In another embodiment of the invention the compound of formula I is administered in combination with at least one further therapeutic agent in an amount that those of ordinary skill in the art can determine by their professional judgement.

The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is administered one or more preferably up to three more preferably up to two times per day. Preference is given to an administration via the oral route. With each administration the number of tablets or capsules taken in at the same time should not exceed two.

Nevertheless it may in some cases be advantageous to deviate from the amounts specified depending on body weight individual behaviour toward the active ingredient type of preparation and time or interval over which the administration is effected. For instance less than the aforementioned minimum amounts may be sufficient in some cases while the upper limit specified has to be exceeded in other cases. In the case of administration of relatively large amounts it may be advisable to divide these into several individual doses over the day.

The combination can comprise effective amounts of at least one compound of Formula I and at least one other therapeutic agent mentioned above which achieves a greater therapeutic efficacy than when either compound is used alone. The combination can be useful to treat prevent or manage pulmonary hypertension where the therapeutic effect is not observed when the agents are used alone or where an enhanced effect is observed when the combination is administered.

The relative ratios of each compound in the combination can also be selected based on their respective mechanisms of action and the disease biology. The relative ratios of each compound can vary widely and this invention includes combinations for treating preventing or managing pulmonary hypertension where the amounts of the formula I compound and the other therapeutic agent can be adjusted routinely such that either is present in higher amounts.

The release of one or more agents of the combination can also be controlled where appropriate to provide the desired therapeutic activity when in a single dosage form combination pack kit or when in separate independent dosage forms.

Preference is given to a combination comprising a compound of formula I and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of phosphodiesterase V inhibitors endothelin antagonists prostacyclin analogues kinase inhibitors and elastase inhibitors. More preferably a combination comprising 4 4 chlorophenylamino 7 2 aminocarbonyl 4 pyridylmethoxy furo 2 3 d pyridazine and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of tadalafil sildenafil vardenafil bosentan sitaxentan ilomedin treprostinil and epoprostenol is used. Most preferably a combination comprising 4 4 chlorophenylamino 7 2 aminocarbonyl 4 pyridylmethoxy furo 2 3 d pyridazine and bosentan or vardenafil is used.

The effects of the compounds and drug combinations according to the invention are tested in vitro on isolated rat pulmonary arteries and in vivo in monocrotaline treated rats with pulmonary hypertension.

Male Wistar rats 250 300 g are anaesthetized with ether and the lungs are removed. The left pulmonary arterial vessel is dissected and placed in ice cold Krebs Henseleit KH buffer of following composition in mmol l NaCl 112 KCl 5.9 CaCl2.0 MgCl1.2 NaHPO1.2 NaHCO25 glucose 11.5 and optionally the compound combination to be tested in a concentration of 10to 10mol 1.

For measurement of isometric tension ring segments 2 mm in length are mounted in a small vessel chamber myograph. Two wires 40 m diameter are introduced through the lumen of the segments and mounted according to the method described by Mulvany and Halpern Circulation Research 1977 41 19 26 . After a 30 min equilibration period in oxygenated KH solution at 37 C. and pH 7.4 segments are stretched to their optimal lumen diameter for active tension development which is determined based on the internal circumference wall tension ratio of the segments by setting their internal circumference to 90 of what the vessels would have if they are exposed to a passive tension equivalent to that produced by a transmural pressure of 30 mmHg.

Afterwards segments are washed three times with KH solution and left to equilibrate for 30 min. Segment contractility is then tested by an initial exposure to a high K solution 120 mmol l K KH solution which is identical to KH solution except that NaCl is replaced by KCl on an equimolar basis .

The vessels are than pre contracted using K 50 mmol l KH solution. When the contraction is stabilized an accumulative dose response curve of the compound combination tested is constructed. The stabilized contraction induced by K 50 mmol l KH solution is defined as 100 tension. The relaxation is expressed as percentage tension.
