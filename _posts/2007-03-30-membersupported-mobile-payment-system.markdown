Embodiments of the present invention relate to systems and techniques for effectuating financial transactions via mobile devices such as mobile or cellular phones and more particularly to a mobile individualized payment transfer infrastructure and method for transferring payment. Further embodiments of the present invention relate to a financial transaction system and more particularly to a closed loop financial transaction system for person to person and consumer to merchant transactions and methods for using the financial transaction system.

Historically an account holder who wished to conclude a financial transaction to buy an item has relied on various financial instruments such as currency checks credit cards or debit cards. Unfortunately these types of financial instruments have certain security issues and fraud prevention is a significant drain on the payment industry s profitability. When cash is lost or stolen there is usually no recourse but to accept the loss. With other financial instruments loss is not a major issue but fraud causes significant losses for the payment industry. Indeed credit card debit card and check fraud have been and continues as a major problem for the industry.

One reason that check fraud is so common arises due to the need to physically present a check to the payer s bank. Thus when a check is accepted in a financial transaction the check is not guaranteed funds. Rather the check is merely a piece of paper where the validity of the bank that it is drawn on must be verified together with the account that is used and the signature used to authorize the payment. With a credit or debit card the user may not be authorized but may rack up considerable charges before the issuer can deactivate the account.

Clearly what is needed is a payment system where the receiver of funds in a financial transaction is able to easily verify the validity of the entity holding the funds the account and the balance and the identity of the person with the phone. Further what is needed is a more secure manner to access credit and debit cards to conclude financial transactions.

While each of the above listed financial instruments have functioned well in the past it is clear that consumers desire a simple secure method for concluding financial transactions. The increasing use of credit cards provide ample evidence that consumers prefer to use electronic payment systems rather than carry large amounts of cash or suffer the hassle of writing multiple checks for small purchases. Even with the wide spread adoption of electronic payment systems it is clear that there is an increasing need for faster cheaper and more convenient electronic payment systems for completing financial transactions. Further there is a need for an electronic payment system that is more individualized such that financial transactions are easily concluded in a manner similar to cash transactions.

Despite the rising use of credit cards there is still a huge global population of people who rely primarily on cash transactions and who still need a convenient and cost effective electronic payment system to send and receive money. This need has led to the growing use of prepaid debit cards. Unfortunately debit cards are primarily designed so that a consumer can cash in the debit card at a merchant who has invested in a point of sale transaction terminal. It is difficult for an individual to transfer a portion of the amount stored on a prepaid debit card to another individual without involving an inconvenient trip to a bank or a merchant with a POS terminal. What is needed is an electronic payment system that enables financial transactions to be concluded between individuals and without the need to directly involve a third party financial institution or an outside financial institution.

Although many people do not have access to POS terminals most have access to a portable wireless communications device often referred to as cellular or cell or mobile devices. Indeed people now routinely take advantage of additional features provide by a typical mobile phone such as text messaging photography and listening to music as mobile devices have evolved to include integrated PDA MP3 paging player and e mail capabilities.

There has been explosive growth in mobile telephony devices and other portable devices that handle communications either through voice e mail SMS text messaging instant messaging and the Internet. People will often remember to carry their mobile or cellular phones with them even if they forget to carry their wallet or car keys. Mobile phones are ubiquitous in the U.S. and in many countries around the world. In 2005 it was estimated that 2.14 billion mobile phone subscribers. About 80 percent of the world s population has mobile phone coverage. Therefore there is a great need for a system to permit mobile phones to send and receive payment just like cash and provide other financial and mobile banking transactions.

Attempts to create a mobile payment system using cellular devices have met with mixed success primarily because the cell phone must have an additional circuit device or chip that is used to store account balances and account information. When the person holding the phone wishes to transfer funds the funds are deducted at the point of sale from the chip and transferred to the financial institution at a later time to be recorded by the financial institution. Clearly this lag between the time the sale is made and the time the sale is recorded is inefficient and risks having sales lost should the merchant s POS equipment malfunction before the sale is recorded. Further if the phone is lost the account balance may be used by whoever is holding the phone. While this system provides better protection against loss of funds and is superior to carrying cash the system lacks adequate security to protect the account holder from improper use by others.

Further a credit card indicates that the holder has been granted a line of credit from a bank or other issuer and it enables the holder to make purchases or withdraw cash up to a prearranged amount. Interest is charged based on the terms of the credit card agreement and the holder is sometimes charged an annual fee. Traditionally a plastic card bearing an account number is assigned to the holder.

Credit card transactions utilize proprietary networks that are paid for by the merchants to settle transactions. Because of the proprietary nature of the payment system such systems costs are high. Also because multiple parties are involved in a credit card transaction such systems are often referred to as open loop financial systems.

To initiate the transaction a consumer would present a credit card or alternatively an RFID key fob at the POS terminal. A key fob is a type of security token a small hardware device with built in storage mechanism. Both the credit card and key fob include encoded information that the POS terminal detects and forwards to transaction processor over the proprietary network . Unfortunately both the credit card and key fob are unable to work without access to the POS terminal either by proximity or over the telephone.

The transaction processor submits the transaction to the credit card interchange a network of financial entities that communicate to manage the processing clearing and settlement of credit card transactions via private network . The credit card interchange routes the transaction to the customer s credit card issuer . The issuer identifies the consumer based on the detected account number and determines the available credit limit before either approving or declining the transaction. If the transaction is approved the amount is forwarded to the merchant s bank processor over the credit card interchange with the amount being added to the credit account maintained by the bank for the merchant.

Since information for the transaction is carried on proprietary networks merchants pay a steep monthly service charge for the privilege accepting credit cards and for accessing these proprietary networks. Merchants further pay a substantial per transaction charge for each transaction. For example to handle a simple transaction to purchase a bottle of water at a convenience store for a 1.00 the merchant may incur a per transaction charge of about 0.25 and 3 percent of the transaction amount although much higher charges are typical if the merchant incurs a lot of charge backs. After accounting for their overhead expenses the per transaction charge can be a substantial part of the overall expenses and in some cases can be more than the profit margin on a particular item. Unfortunately for many small merchants the combination of the monthly service charge and the per transaction interchange charge may exceed their total profit on credit card sales for the month. For larger merchants the interchange fee is less of a significant drag on profitability but still an unwelcome erosion of their profit margins.

Not only are credit cards a high cost expense item for most merchants they are also subject to substantial fraud and abuse. For example if a credit card is stolen it may be used at a POS terminal by anyone even if they are not the holder. To prevent such use many POS terminals now include a request that the consumer enter in the postal zip code where the credit card bill is sent to authenticate the consumer as the holder. Unfortunately postal information is readily available on the Internet so the enterprising thief is not deterred by the additional information request to complete the transaction. The holder however is annoyed by having to enter such superfluous information.

Finally the open loop credit card system is simply not adaptable to person to person transactions where one party is not a merchant. For example if two students want to share the expenses for a pair of movie tickets one student may wish to electronically transfer funds to the other student. However the interchange fee alone would make the transaction sufficiently expensive to discourage use. Further it is unlikely that either student would agree to pay the monthly fee and other charges associated with a merchant s account in order to access the credit card interchange. Accordingly the closed loop system deployed and operated by the credit card issuers is wholly ill suited for person to person financial transactions.

Therefore what is needed is a cost effective mobile payment system that enables an account holder the flexibility to conduct their financial transactions any time anywhere. What is also needed is a mobile wallet that people can carry as a cash source that is accessible from a mobile phone. Further what is needed is a software application and managed service for consumer mobile payments that operates as a mobile wallet on a mobile phone platform. This mobile wallet should be secure easy to use and easy to acquire so that the ability to make mobile payments is available to any mobile account holder. Moreover what is needed is a closed loop financial transaction system that facilitates payments without the substantial payment charges associated with closed loop financial systems and has a high level of security for the holder the merchant and others involved in the financial transactions. Accordingly the following embodiments and exemplary descriptions of inventions are disclosed.

A member supported payment system is available to consumers and merchants without sign up fees subscription fees or transaction fees to either consumers or merchants. In a specific implementation the member payment system is a mobile payment system where consumers may conduct transactions using a mobile device such as a mobile telephone smartphone personal digital assistant or similar portable wireless handheld device. Merchants will make a refundable one time contribution. These contributions are stored in a pooled trust account by the system and the float dividends or interest on these contributions will fund the system.

In an embodiment the invention is a method including receiving a plurality of merchant contributions to fund a member payment system placing the merchant contributions into a pooled trust account where merchants will not receive interest on their contributions permitting a plurality of consumers to become registered users of the mobile payment without charge permitting registered users to load or unload funds into a working account of the member payment system without charge and permitting merchants to load or unload funds into the working account of the member payment system without charge where interest on pooled trust account funds the member payment system.

In an implementation the merchant contribution may be a paid in installments over a period of time. Depending on the amount of the contribution the merchant will have greater access or privileges in the system. For example there may be set levels of contributions which correspond to a number of transactions a merchant will be entitled to without additional fee. Also the merchant may make a subsequent contribution to increase the merchant s privileges.

In an implementation the member payment system permits a registered user to request payment of money to another register user via a mobile phone. The member payment system may permit a registered user to request payment of money to a merchant via a mobile phone.

The member payment system may manage transactions records of the registered users. The member payment system manages transactions records of the merchants. The member payment system may manage transactions records of the registered users and merchants. This will reduce the costs to the merchants since they do not need to manage their own transactions records.

The contribution is refundable so the merchant can decide later not to participate. For example when a merchant requests a refund of the merchant s contribution to the member payment system registered users will no longer be permitted to transfer money to the merchant.

Generally the merchant is not charged a periodic recurring transaction fee for being a participant of the member payment system. The system is funded by the float on the pooled trust containing the merchant s contributions.

Registered users may load or unload funds by way of at least one of Automated Clearing House ACH or direct deposit account DDA . In further implementations of the system the registered users and merchants may be provided numerous additional ways to load and unload funds. For example a registered user may choose to have the user s paycheck or a portion of the paycheck directly deposited into the system.

In an implementation the method includes permitting a registered user to authorize paying a merchant through the member payment system by using a two factor authorization scheme. These two factors of authorization may include 1 what the person has e.g. phone card and 2 what the person knows e.g. PIN mother s maiden name challenge question . For example the system may permit a registered user to authorize paying a merchant through the member payment system by using a mobile phone of the registered user and the user correctly entering a personal identification number or PIN.

Optionally each registered user may also be provided a debit card. With the debit card users may make charges without for example a mobile phone.

A mobile payment platform and service provides a fast easy way to make payments by users of mobile devices. The platform also interfaces with nonmobile channels and devices such as e mail instant messenger and Web. In an implementation funds are accessed from an account holder s mobile device such as a mobile phone or a personal digital assistant to make or receive payments. Financial transactions may be conducted on a person to person P2P or person to merchant P2M basis where each party is identified by a unique indicator such as a telephone number or bar code. Transactions may be requested through any number of means including SMS messaging Web e mail instant messenger a mobile client application an instant messaging plug in application or widget. The mobile client application resident on the mobile device simplifies access and performing financial transactions in a fast secure manner.

The invention provides a mobile payment system MPS or mobile person to person payment system that allows fast and easy money transactions. The mobile phone is becoming more and more ubiquitous around the world. Many people carry a mobile phone or similar portable communications device even if they do not carry a wallet around with them as they go about their daily lives. Through the mobile payment system and their phones users will be able to do what they can with a normal wallet and much much more. Users will be able send and receive money pay for services pay for bills pay for movie tickets pay for groceries pay a babysitter pay for coffee and a newspaper instantly pay back a friend split a dinner bill send money to children get money from parents get quick or emergency cash send emergency cash pay up or collect on a friendly wager pay for fantasy football pay for gardening services pay for association dues track purchases check the balance and more.

Platform comprises a server that handles interaction with account holders and maintains transactions records. Server also provides the link to value added services provided by merchant partners. Server utilizes a transactional database that preferably comprises a data storage network. Server uses information such as account numbers balance information etc obtained from transactional database to manage a payment processor that communicates with merchant point of sale POS terminals . Merchants may use the POS terminals for financial transactions such as adding funds to a debit card for an account holder. Merchants may also establish a separate link to payment server for accounting purposes.

A settlement engine handles the transactions within the closed loop system which will settle on a real time basis. The user s account and the merchant s account will be updated simultaneously. Because most merchants may also serve as load agents the merchants will carry a balance in their account. The settlement engine will be primarily used to sweep a preset dollar amount or a dollar amount over a minimum to an external bank account held by the merchant.

The settlement engine facilitates person to person P2P transactions because of the ability to transfer funds from one enrolled account holder to another enrolled account holder.

Platform further comprises a fraud detection system for tracking information distilled from each financial transaction. Such fraud detection systems are known and are often used to monitor for fraud when credit cards are used. Risk is controlled by a general rules engine see that applies limits and determine the acceptability of requested transactions from a risk perspective.

The information collected for each financial transaction may be mined for use by merchant and consumer value added applications by business monitoring applications by system operations applications and security monitoring applications as indicated at .

To illustrate a marketing engine delivers coupons or discounts to account holders from participating merchants. This engine also controls the use of instant account credits to stimulate enrollment.

A currency translation module facilitates foreign operation where the value measurement in the closed loop payment system needs to be translated to other currencies. The module will also be used to control foreign exchange exposure.

Viral engine provides the ability to send funds to an unenrolled user. This module allows the account holder to send the funds which will send a message to the receiver that the funds are being held for them provided that they enroll.

A roaming feature provides a Peer to Merchant transaction environment where the merchant will use a mobile phone to receive the funds where the merchant does not have access to a terminal that would typically be used for credit or debit card acceptance. One advantage of the present invention arises from the security of not accepting cash and guaranteed funds versus a check and also provides instant verification which is not feasible with a credit card purchase without a terminal.

The transactional databases integrate directly with a pooled bank account maintained at a partner bank. All funds stay within this account although merchants have the option of transferring their funds from their prepaid debit accounts to other accounts through ACH transfers or direct DDA integration through a direct API with their bank or through the ATM network. It will be appreciated that more than one partner bank may be set up such that each account may be linked to a pooled bank account at more than one bank. Since platform knows the available balance for each account regardless of the number of bank partners there is no risk of funds not being available when interbank settlements occur.

Working with marketing partners including mobile operators nationally branded merchants and financial service providers such as the major banks and credit unions the payment system infrastructure takes advantage of the existing mobile infrastructure and messaging technology to offer low cost universally accessible financial services. In an implementation the system of the invention provides interoperability between banks. There is also interoperability between pooled accounts and any card holder accounts that are held as individual accounts.

Mobile service providers gain incremental revenue as well as additional data traffic and a competitive advantage by offering their subscribers a digital payment solution. Unlike other payment systems the present invention can be offered to a provider s entire customer base since it can use SMS or mobile Internet service e.g. WAP in addition to a downloadable application.

In addition account holders can either pay their bills or top off minutes via their service account. This is especially useful for account holders who do not have other financial services available to them.

Various merchants who traditionally accept credit cards debit cards checks and cash will accept the mobile individualized payment transfer infrastructure because of the low adoption cost. Merchants also have an opportunity to earn commissions for handling prepaid account transactions such as helping account holders add funds to their accounts. Most merchants may also provide small amounts of cash back similar to the debit card model in use today.

A specific embodiment of the mobile payment service of the invention has mobile P2M extensions and web services. These allow a merchant to easily accept payment from a user either from a mobile phone or website. They can also help the merchant lower their cost of accepting the transaction and increase their reach to their customers.

Banks may now mobilize their existing customer base with instant access to their accounts and the ability to make account holder to account holder payments. Cross bank transactions are also possible. With this partnership banks can also reach consumers previously too expensive to serve. Rather than incur the expense of establishing a bank and adhering to a heavy regulatory regime pooled accounts at participating banks handle the front ledgers report net positions to or on behalf of its partner banks and allow the banks to conduct the final settlement. This is to enable compliance with governmental regulations and allow active coexistence with the banking environment.

By using partner banks and companion bank accounts the payment system infrastructure is designed to enhance account holders existing bank accounts whenever possible yet act as a discrete account when necessary. All funds represented by individual prepaid debit accounts will be maintained in commercial bank accounts held in trust for account holders. At the end of each business day the aggregate balance of all the accounts will equal the bank balance. All transactions created within a twenty four hour period will be settled within that period. The accounts function like a wallet with cash where the balance changes immediately. In other words the present invention does not function as a demand deposit in which instruments may be presented by a third party. For instance account holders will not be able to issue demand instruments such as checks. As a result there will be no pending transactions that settle at a future date.

In a specific implementation of the invention debit card accounts are not held in a pooled account by mobile payment service provider but in individual debit card accounts at a direct bank partner. The mobile payment service provider holds money in a pooled account for customers without cards is held in trust at the bank.

In one embodiment of the present invention an account holder adds money to a prepaid debit account in advance of purchases. Money may be added to a prepaid debit account at a partner s location by way of interactive voice response IVR using their mobile phone or another phone via a website accessible over the Internet or by contacting a customer service representative. In an embodiment a user may set up a direct deposit link or link an account to a bank account via the ACH or ATM networks. Money may be transferred from an existing account at a financial service provider partner such as a banking institution or by depositing cash or a check to the prepaid debit account at a participating merchant or other third party . Account holders then have access to these funds through their mobile devices to make payments and they may receive payments to their account activity from others. In other embodiments funds may be transferred from a designated credit card account into the prepaid debit account.

In another embodiment funds from each account holder are pooled at a single financial institution and each account holder has an interest in the pooled account equal to the funds deposited minus the funds transferred to another account plus the funds received from others. Account holders may withdraw some or all of their available funds from the pooled account.

In another embodiment each account holder may set up a prepaid debit account at any financial institution and access the account indirectly to transfer funds. Thus account holders are not limited to a debit card with funds maintained in the pooled account at a particular financial institution. Rather account holders may access a debit card account at a financial institution of their choosing.

In another embodiment a credit card account is designated as the primary account and a cash advance is moved to a prepaid debit card account whenever the funds in the debit card account drop to or below a selected amount.

In yet another embodiment financial transactions are conducted on a person to person basis where each party is identified by a telephone number and a password e.g. a personal identification number of PIN. Alternatively the financial transaction may be identified by a user name and password. In other embodiments at least one party to a transaction is identified by a bar code. The bar code may be displayed on a display such as the screen of a mobile telephone and detected by the camera that is present on most modern mobile devices. The bar code may be printed on the device or may be otherwise attached to the mobile device.

In one specific embodiment a software application referred to as a mobile client application MCA resident on the mobile phone only requires account holders to have a mobile phone number and the prepaid debit account. Optionally a credit card or a checking account may be accessed as a source of funding. Advantageously no additional hardware such as a point of sale terminal or Internet access required. Once registered a account holder sets up a unique account holder identification number PIN to verify all transactions. Upon registering the account holder enters their mobile phone number and a server pushes the mobile client application to their phone. Once the mobile client application is installed the account holder can begin using the mobile phone for concluding financial transactions. Another option is for the user to download the application by going to a specific URL using the user s mobile Internet browser e.g. get.obopay.com which will start the download process for the mobile application.

Account holders may also choose to link their account to a debit or credit cards offered by financial institution and which can be used at the millions of merchant locations worldwide. In addition it allows account holders to obtain cash from the prepaid debit account using an ATM should the need arise.

To account holders concluding a financial transaction is seamless. By simply sending a message from the mobile client application equipped mobile phone to a server. The payment server validates each transaction and transfers funds or responds to the account holder s request for account information.

When an account holder makes a transaction request from their mobile phone information is routed to the mobile operator such as Cingular or Verizon or other mobile phone service provider. The information is then routed to the payment server through a secure Internet connection. In alternative embodiments the information is routed over alternative networks such as wireless networks POTS or other available network. This redundancy is important because the account holder is not limited to a single access path to control their account and conduct financial transactions. Depending on the account holder s location or other circumstances one or more communications avenues may not be available. However because of the system redundancy there will likely be at least one communication avenue available and then the financial transaction will be allowed.

Financial transaction requests are transmitted in one of two ways depending on the account holder s mobile phone. If the account holder has an application enabled phone which enables transmitting the financial request through a Web based application HTTP or HTTPS or a mobile application such as J2ME .NET .NET CF WAP or SMS or any combination of these the transmission goes directly to the server. A request message is sent once MCA establishes a connection with the payment server.

Since application enabled devices currently constitute a relatively small portion of the devices being used today the payment server also transmits and receives through Short Message Service also referred to as SMS text messaging or simply SMS because nearly all devices support SMS. In this case financial data is routed to the mobile operator and then to an SMS aggregator who transmits messages to the payment server in real time.

A SMS mobile payment system avoids the expense and problems associated with having a chip added to the cell phone. In operation the SMS system financial information is sent using SMS text messaging. While SMS text messaging works well with all types of cell devices and certain other types of mobile communication devices such as portable digital assistants or PDAs SMS exposes unencrypted passwords or personal identification numbers PINs as well as balance information or details about the most recent transaction. Since anyone in possession of the phone can read the SMS message file and immediately know how to access the account of another the present invention. Accordingly in one embodiment the present invention provides for the initiation of the financial transaction by way of SMS text message. The SMS message starts with a key word that provides the type of transaction requested PAY REQUEST PAYMENT BALANCE TRANSFER or HELP. In an implementation PAY is referred to as SEND and REQUEST PAY is referred to as GET. 

Where the SMS message contains the key word that indicates a desire to transfer funds from one account holder to another account holder the key word would be either pay or request payment or send or get . After the key word the amount is entered with or without a decimal point. After the amount the target telephone number or short code e mail address license number or other identifying information is entered. This information may be obtained from the telephone directory of the mobile device. After the telephone number the account holder may enter in a message for display to the other party. In some circumstances this message may be a null message. In some embodiments the account holder may enter a supplemental message for record keeping purposes.

Once the SMS message is sent to the payment server the PIN is entered by the account holder and sent through a voice channel connection to the payment server to verify the SMS message. The PIN is entered in via the keyboard and may be any alphanumeric code. The PIN is then sent to the payment sever as a DTMF encoded message where DTMF refers to dual tone multi frequency the signal a telephone company receives when a telephone s touch keys are pressed

At the server the payment server receives the SMS message via the SMS text message communication path and the PIN through the voice channel. The call to the payment server may be made by the account holder or it may be initiated as a call back feature by the payment server in response to receipt of the SMS message. The PIN may be sent as a DTMF encoded message to maintain security but in other embodiments the PIN may be spoken by the account holder and converted by an interactive voice recognition software module operating on the payment server or another server not shown dedicated to the handling voice calls.

In one embodiment the mobile device includes the mobile client application. The mobile client application is invoked either directly by the account holder or in response to activation of the SMS text messaging feature on the mobile device. The MCA determines the best method for sending the PIN.

In one alternative embodiment the PIN is encrypted by the mobile client application and included in a subsequent SMS message that is sent to the payment server. The payment server correlates the messages by matching the telephone number and the time each message was sent. If the PIN was sent in a message that was distant in time compared to the SMS message the transaction may be rejected. If only one of the two messages are received the transaction may be rejected. If however both the SMS message with the financial transaction details minimum of at a keyword and the PIN code are received and are verified then the financial transaction is concluded.

In an alternative embodiment when a voice channel is available the mobile client application invokes a module to encode the PIN into DTMF form. The DTMF is then sent by the mobile client application to the payment server along a voice channel connection established by the mobile client application. The module may be a Java API that generates the appropriate tones based on keypad input.

In yet another alternative embodiment the mobile client application provides a user interface UI on the display screen of the mobile device to guide the account holder for concluding the financial transaction. In this embodiment the account holder is guided through the process of constructing the SMS text message by the automatic insertion of the keyword amount target telephone number password and messages if any.

In yet another alternative embodiment the SMS message may include the keyword the amount the target telephone number and the password. A shortcoming of this implementation is that the password would be visible to anyone controlling the mobile device. However the present invention manages this problem by sending a message or instructing the user through help and FAQ information to the account holder to delete the sent message from the SMS log folder. These instructions may also suggest that the account holder turn off message logging outgoing SMS messages when conducing financial transactions.

The following description illustrates use of SMS text messaging to provide account holders access to the payment server from any SMS capable mobile phone or other SMS enabled device. The mobile client application is not required to be resident on the mobile device although as has been discussed there are advantages to having the mobile client application be loaded onto the mobile device.

In operation the account holder sends a text message to the payment server using the existing text message capability on their phone. The functionality includes Pay or Send Request Pay or Get Balance History and Help invoked by using any of these features as a keyword. There may also be a refer or invite option to permit the user to invite another person to join the system. The referrer or referee or both may be given a referral bonus. The account holder enters the keyword together with additional information in the body of the text message to construct a command that is then sent to the payment server. Access to the payment server may be by way of a toll free telephone number a short code or an e mail address all of which identify the payment server to the SMS text messaging system. An example of a short code is 62729 which is used as the target phone number for their text message commands to the payment server. An example of an e mail address is sms obopay.com which is the e mail target for SMS text message commands sent to the payment server.

To send a payment to another person or a merchant using the SMS method the account holder would enter the command string shown in table A.

Each item should have a space between it and the previous item. In an implementation the keyword is not case sensitive. The mobile number should include area code plus mobile number with no spaces present in the mobile number. The account holder may enter a leading 1 or not on the phone number. A dollar sign is not required to be entered with the amount but should be allowed. The user should be able to optionally include a message with their payment.

In an alternative example the PIN is sent in a second message by way of a voice call. To send a payment to another person or a merchant using the combined SMS plus voice channel method the account holder would enter the command string shown in table B.

The PIN is sent to the payment server over the voice communication channel that is the cellular network the Internet or POTS.

When a request for payment is made to an account holder using either the SMS method or the combined SMS plus voice method they may either accept or decline the request using the manual SMS text messaging system.

On the payment server side one or more data centers would have systems for processing the financial transactions. Each data centers would contain a combination of PBX ACD VRU technology to allow multiple simultaneous call processing. The VRU technology can be used to provide programmable inbound and outbound DTMF support. The VRU can be connected to an enterprise J2EE system which represent the actual business logic and system of record for the financial transactions. The J2EE system can then integrate with actual banks for settlement of the transactions. In an implementation there is a one time password option for SMS security as an option. This would work by having the user send the transaction without a PIN and then the system would either send the user a series of questions that they answer.

Sending money to another account holder or merchant is fast and simple. The present system simplifies mass payments such as collecting for a charity event from many account holders or sending multiple transactions from the same account holder at the same time.

Sending money from one account holder to another across the room across town or across the country is easy convenient and inexpensive. A prepaid debit account holder can send money to any SMS enabled handset account holder even if they do not have the mobile client application installed on their mobile device or a prepaid debit account. If the recipient is not already an account holder the recipient receives a SMS text message indicating that funds have been transferred in their name. To get timely access to these funds the recipient may register for their own prepaid debit account. This viral messaging makes it easy for nonaccount users to become registered account holders themselves. If the mobile device used by the nonaccount user supports a WAP or mobile Internet browser then the sign up may occur immediately via the telephone. The user also has the option to sign up for the service using the web a kiosk in person at a merchant partner or through another device.

The flexibility of the present invention enables novel methods of selecting and identifying parties to a transaction. In one embodiment the payer may type a telephone number or other identifying code into the keypad of their mobile device. An identifying code may be a special three four or five digit short code that is translated to a specific account by the mobile services provider. For example if an account holder wishes to download a television show made available by a television network such as the CBS television network the account holder may type in a short code of 227 to pay the network for the desired content. The short code may use any alphanumeric character. This embodiment requires that certain parties arrange to acquire a short code to encourage users to access their services.

In an alternative embodiment the recipient of funds may be identified by a telephone number selected from the address book function on the mobile device. Thus there is no need to separately enter in the telephone number. In an implementation a hosted address book is used where the user would set up their address book with the service and then that address book would be available to them through any device that they use. To initially populate the hosted address book the system may provide interfaces into third party address books such as Outlook a phone personal information manager PIM address book or third party services such as Plaxo.

In yet another alternative embodiment the payer may use the camera function on the mobile device to acquire an image that identifies the payee. One example of an image would be a bar code.

In yet another alternative embodiment the payer is identified by the payee by means of an acquired image. One such acquired image is a bar code displayed either on a display screen or visibly affixed on an outer portion of the mobile device.

In yet another embodiment either the payer or the payee is identified by means of a proximity device such as a radio frequency identification device RFID or a near field communication NFC device.

 4 by texting code to the service that identifies the product and merchant that a user wants to purchase 

 5 by selecting a option to pay with the service from with a merchant s electronic shopping cart or web or mobile application or

In an embodiment of the invention a mobile device is associated to one or more bank accounts checking savings credit prepaid or a pooled account and the like and the account holder can transfer funds in real time from one account to another without any access to a service center and without any internet or computer access. Advantageously the account holder can select the account from which funds are obtained to make a purchase in real time.

In another embodiment of the invention account holders contribute to a master interest bearing account held by a bank partner. At any time the account holder can withdraw their full contribution without any penalty. The bank partner manages the payment system and is compensated with the interest that is accumulated.

In another embodiment NFC is used to communicate between mobile devices to conclude financial transactions using the infrastructure of the present invention. In yet another embodiment NFC is used to communicate from a mobile device to a POS terminal to conclude financial transactions.

There are many existing products and potentially a large number of new products that will benefit from the present invention. For example any Internet enabled telephone device such as a VOIP telephone may be used to practice the present invention even though it may be affixed at a specific location and is not necessarily mobile. In other embodiments e mail addresses are used in addition to or in lieu of telephone numbers to identify one or more parties to a financial transaction.

It will further be appreciated that one or more of the elements depicted in the drawings figures can also be implemented in a more separated or integrated manner or even removed or rendered as inoperable in certain cases as is useful in accordance with a particular application.

Operating the mobile individualized payment transfer infrastructure provides the opportunity to generate a revenue stream without charging a surcharge on transactions where a merchant is one of the parties. It is recognized that in the mobile or wireless world cell phone users are often willing to invest a small monthly fee to acquire access certain services. Accordingly revenue is generated by charging a small per transaction to send money. In one exemplary embodiment the per transaction fee ranges from a few pennies for transactions under a selected amount such as 25. To illustrate further the per transaction fee may range from 0.05 to about 0.10 per transaction in alternative embodiments. Any fee may be charge from less than one cent per transaction to dollars per transaction. For example the fee may be from 0.00001 to 10 per transaction.

The fee may be charged on both the party receiving payment and the party sending payment. Alternatively the fee may be charged to account holder sending the money. In still other embodiments a percentage of the transaction amount is charged to conclude the transaction. In this embodiment the fee is charged for higher value transactions such as by way of illustration 25. A fee notice if any is preferably displayed on the approval screen prior to the account holder s final approval and authorization to send the payment. In still other embodiments the fee may be waived for small transaction amounts. Thus there would be no per transaction fee when small purchases are made using the payment transfer infrastructure. Another operating model is to charge on a subscription basis.

Rather than pay a per transaction fee account holders may elect to pay a flat monthly charge to send and receive payments. In this embodiment there are no per transaction fees. The monthly charge may vary with merchants paying a higher or lower in some circumstances fee than individual users.

Accordingly the present invention contemplates three different revenue generation models. Specifically 1 a per transaction fee is assessed against one or both parties to a financial transaction. Preferably the fee amount is nominal ranging from about a penny to about 0.15 2 flat rate monthly price plan where every account holder would pay a monthly service charge 3 high value transaction fee for transactions over a selected amount such as by way of illustration 50 the fee waived for all other transactions and 4 value added services such as linking to an accounting service to automatically record transaction details or to help prepare for filing tax statements. The service may get float for holding funds or advertising revenue and these may be applied to merchant fees e.g. interchange .

Upon receipt of the payment request server transfers funds from the payer s account to an account for the account holder associated with mobile device . The financial institution that manages pooled account is notified of the transaction as indicated by reference arrow . In this manner money is added to the account associated with mobile device and debited from the account associated with mobile device . The financial institution then sends a confirmation as indicated by reference arrow .

Server platform also sends a notice of the payment to mobile device as indicated by reference arrow . A second message is sent indicating that the payment had been made is sent to mobile phone as indicated by reference arrow . If the user of mobile device is not an account holder a new account may be opened as indicated by reference arrow . Alternatively the user may withdraw funds from a designated ATM or other facility associated with financial institution that manages the pooled funds.

Server platform then documents the transaction by sending the transaction amount and the description of the transaction to an accounting and record keeping service as indicated by reference arrow . Thereafter the account holder may access the information describing their purchases that is stored and organized by account and record keeping service either via the mobile device or by another Internet connection not shown .

To further show how a bill payment gets into the accounts receivable system consider a small business that uses an accounting program which may be stored on a personal computer to print out a paper invoice that it mails to its customer. The customer must then pay the small business which is usually done by check. Because the paper invoice may not be sent with the check the small business needs to associate the account number with the check. If not the account number is not written on the check time is wasted trying to locate match the payment to a copy of the invoice. The small business then deposits the check to their bank and manually enters the data into their accounts receivable accounting program. Clearly this antiquated process is slow and expensive to support.

However with the present invention the small business need only select an invoicing option that puts the invoice from the accounting program into an OFX format by way of example or other import export format readable by an accounting program. This electronic invoice is then sent to the payment platform see . The payment platform creates a Request Payment message that is sent to the customer. When the customer approves payment of the invoice the payment data is sent back to the account to accounting program via OFX and puts the money into the small business account. The OFX message posts the item to accounting program. Since the customer s accounts receivable identification is their phone number tracking and record keeping is greatly simplified. It should be noted that funds are guaranteed all the way through and there are no bounced checks or other such problems.

For accounts payable transactions accounting and record keeping service sends an OFX message with by way of illustration an employee s expense reimbursement T E payment. The money is transferred to the employee s account and notification is sent to their mobile device. Advantageously the present invention eliminates the manual process of entering each transaction into the accounting program.

The system may interface with wireless phones handle by any of multiple carriers such as Verizon Cingular AT T Sprint Nextel Alltel Virgin Mobile Amp d Mobile U.S. Cellular T Mobile and others. The service may also interface with prepaid phones. Some benefits for the mobile carrier include a revenue share model based transmission or subscription basis. Promotes application download purchase. Promotes network or data usage. Promotes SMS usage. Off bill payment solution which will help alleviate the surprise big bill problem.

The mobile payment system allows many different financial services for the user. Examples of some services includes credit card load debit card load Automated Clearing House ACH load ACH unload person to person P2P payment remote pay RPAY viral person to merchant P2M and referrals. Other services may include automated teller machine ATM network load and unload such as through the NYCE PLUS or STAR ATM system. The system may also include bill pay integration where a user may pay bills such as a cable bill electricity bill Internet service bill telephone bill housekeeping service bill and other bills.

Loading of an account refers to transferring of funds to an account on the mobile payment system where funds may be transacted. For example a user may load funds from a checking account or credit card to the user s mobile payment system account which may be managed by financial partner or managed by the operator of the mobile payment system.

Unloading of an account refers to transferring of funds from the mobile payment system to another account. For example a user may unload funds from the user s mobile payment system account which may be managed by financial partner or managed by the operator of the mobile payment system to a checking account or credit card.

Loading and unloading may be performed in any of the ways discussed in this application including through ACH ATM or credit card or interchange. The ACH is generally the least expensive but ACH is usually not real time because funds get settled in a batch mode at the end of the day. So when an ACH fund transfer is requested the actual funds will not be transferred and made available to the mobile payment system until typically the end of the day. For ATM and credit cards the money transfer is real time. ATM is typically more expensive than ACH but less expensive to use than credit cards. Note that both ATM and ACH may be used to access a checking account of a user. Credit cards are generally the most expensive of the three to use. In an implementation the system of the invention allows load and unload from any of these networks. In another implementation the system allows load and unload from only one or more of these such as from ACH only ACH and ATM only credit card only ATM only ATM and credit card only or ACH and credit card only.

The mobile person to person payment system further provides a platform for one or more financial partners. These partners may includes an acquirer partner such as Pay by Touch PBT Verisign or other bank or other financial institutional partner such as a New York City San Francisco San Jose California London Shanghai Hong Kong or Tokyo bank electronic bank NYCE direct partner such as co branded prepaid cards prepaid processing partner and an ACH partner. The mobile payment system may also interface with point of sale POS systems.

There may be any number and combination of partners and services discussed. For example a system may have only a single partner may have two partners three partners or more than three partners. A system may include a single banking partner providing a debit card only i.e. no credit card for access by the mobile clients. A system may include a single banking partner providing a debit card and a credit card for access by the mobile clients. A system may include a two or more banking partners one providing a debit card and another providing a different debit card for access by the mobile clients. A system may include a two or more banking partners one providing a debit card and another providing a different debit card and a credit card for access by the mobile clients. A system may include a single banking partner providing a credit card only for access by the mobile clients. A system may include a single banking partner providing a credit card only for access by the mobile clients.

For each type of partner e.g. debit card there may be multiple such partner entities that interface with the mobile payment system or network. For example the system may interface with two banks bank A and bank B or any number of banking partners. The system may have any combination of the partners described in this application. For example the system may have a direct partner and bank partner but not a prepaid processing partner. The system may have a prepaid processing partner only. The system may have a direct partner only. The system may have multiple bank partners.

Each partner system may have a different electronic interfacing scheme and the mobile payment system will communicate using the appropriate application program interface API for each partner. A system of the invention allows easy integration of financial partners e.g. banking partners card partners to mobile and other consumer partners e.g. mobile phone carriers .

In a particular implementation of the system the acquirer partner has a settlement account. The bank partner has pooled and working accounts. The direct partner has pooled and working accounts. The prepaid processing partner has pooled and working accounts. The ACH partner has a settlement account. The mobile payment system may provide one or more of pooled account management cross bank settlement and treasury management and mobile banking integration.

The systems funds are represented by the aggregation of all partner bank pooled accounts. By way of business relationship with the mobile payment system the mobile payment system facilitates a periodic treasury management process such that partner bank pooled accounts retain balances that are representative of their contribution to the mobile payment system customer base plus an agreed percentage of other mobile payment system funds. An acquisition path of a customer dictates the pooled account balance for a given partner bank i.e. the more customers that a partner bank acquires through their paths the higher the balance of their associated pooled account .

Users are typically associated with specific financial partners such as a particular bank. In the mobile payment system each user will have a user profile that has settings for that user. These parameters may include 1 a level of participation 2 which processor e.g. which financial partner 3 velocity settings 4 linked accounts or any combination of these. The system may include any number of parameter settings in a user profile more or fewer than described in this patent application.

The system of the invention operates any number of different financial partners e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 507 1001 2054 3096 or more each of which may have a different API interface. In each user profile the setting for which processor will indicate which financial partner a user is associated with. When transacting business for that user the system will then know where which bank to direct transactions and which API to use so that the user s value exchange transactions which are typically money exchanges are transacted properly.

The setting of the level of participation will be the privileges or level of service the user will have. The level of participation setting may be based on a number of factors such as what information provided when the user signed up how much money the user has in user s account how many referrals the user has made how many transaction the user has made or total dollars transacted. This profile setting may be updated periodically as new information is gathered. Some examples of names the level of participation for a user may be bronze gold silver and platinum levels. The level of participation may be made visible to the user and may be used to build customer loyalty. In other embodiments of the invention the level of participation may be hidden or otherwise not made available to the user.

When registering with the system the system will give the user a choice of how much information the user wants to reveal. For example the user may choose to reveal the user s mobile phone number and then fund the user s account with cash. This may be the minimum required to open account. The user will be given the option to provide other information such as e mail address credit card number social security number e.g. for a credit check checking account number and so forth. In an implementation of the invention the more information the user chooses to reveal the higher the level of participation the user will achieve.

In an implementation for the level of participation setting the user may be one of four user states 1 invited 2 enrolled 3 verified and 4 advanced. In other implementations there may be additional states. For the invited state the user has been referred or sent viral money. Viral refers to the sending or receipt of money where one of the users is a user that has not previously registered with the system. A viral user may also be referred to as a nonmember user or unregistered user. Viral refers to a characteristic of the mobile payment system of the invention which encourages or allows current users to transact with nonmember users. As more users register and use of the system the users will help spread news and bring in additional users somewhat similarly to how viruses are transmitted. For example in order for a nonmember user to receive the money the nonmember will be encouraged to sign up as a member.

For the enrolled state the user has entered basic information such as a confirmed phone. The phone may be confirmed by the system calling the phone number provided by the user at sign up. This call may be an automated or IVR type call. There may be an incentive for the user to sign up such as the user receiving money e.g. 5 that is put into the user s account. The incentive may be referred to as a referral bonus and may be any amount. The referral bonus may be paid only to the referrer only to the referee or to both. In this state the user may receive and request money.

For the verified state the user s identity is known. The user provides address or other related contact information. A user in the verified state may receive request add i.e. load or withdraw i.e. unload money.

For the advanced state the user has provided the user s social security number. In this state for example the user may sign up for with a particular banking partner to receive a card. This card may be a prepaid debit card. In other embodiments the card may be a credit card. The user will be able to do everything a verified user can plus be able to instantly spend money wherever the card is accepted. The card may be accepted or usable through one or more networks including Visa MasterCard American Express NYCE PLUS or STAR or any combination of these. The card is linked to the user s account. A user without a card may be called a no card user while a user with a card may be called a carded user.

Some ways a person can get verified when signing up includes For person information the system may ask for address and driver s license number. An alternative is to ask for address and social security number. The information can be checked against a credit reporting agency s database such as the Equifax database. For a linked bank account these may be verified using challenge deposits. For example the system may make any number of small deposits to the user s account. The user tells the system the amount of those deposits to get verification. Alternatively the user may verify through on line instant account verification where a user provide an on line screen name and password. For adding credit or debit card these may also be verified using challenge deposits. Some cards such as Visa and MasterCard may alternatively be verified using security codes and the like.

The velocity of participation is a setting that sets certain restrictions or limits on the account. Some examples on limits of an account are how many transactions a day a user may perform or amount of money that may be transferred in a transaction. There may some hard limits and soft limits. Hard limits will not change with intervention by a third party such as person changing the limit. Soft limits may change depending on the user s actions. For example after the user has remained a member for six months the user may be automatically allowed five transactions a day when the user s previous limit for some number fewer than five.

Typically the user will not have access or know the velocity of participation setting. However in certain implementation the user may be given velocity of participation information such as credit or transaction limits.

Linked accounts are another feature that may be stored in a user s profile. However any of the user settings discussed in this application or combination of these may be kept in separate location not necessarily in the user s profile. Linked accounts are a feature of the system where multiple identities of a user are centralized or unified into a single account. There may be an anchor e.g. such as an account number for the user and multiple identities would be associated with this anchor. These identities may include multiple phone numbers e mail address instant messenger identifiers and so forth. The user would not need to know the account number or anchor to access the account. The user would be able to access the user s account through any of the associated identities.

Furthermore in an implementation to add identities to an account the user would validate each of the new identities. This could be done through an IVR callback or responding to an SMS message in the case of a phone number. For an e mail it may be done through sending an e mail with a unique URL or a pass code that the user would respond with on our webpage. And with an instant messenger ID it could be done by responding to an IM.

Other options available in a user s profile may include preference settings for certain features. Such options may be set or modified by the user at any time by accessing an account maintenance screen. Also the user may be asked whether to enable or disable options during the registration flow see below . One feature is an auto accept and manual accept feature. When auto accept is turned on payments sent to this member will automatically be accepted. When manual accept is enabled payments sent to this member will need to be manually accepted or rejected.

A basic flow of the transaction is 1 Consumer A sends mobile payment system a pay request. This pay request may be provided by any one of the ways discussed in this patent. 2 The mobile payment system updates the T or transaction records in mobile payment system system of record SOR to reflect the transaction. These transaction records are managed by the mobile payment system. 3 The system e.g. Obopay notifies consumer B of payment. This may be by way of an electronic notification e mail instant message SMS message or other notification.

A basic flow of the transaction is 1 Consumer A sends the mobile payment system pay request. 2 Mobile payment system transfers funds from pooled account to working account. 3 Mobile payment system transfers funds from working account to pooled account. 4 Mobile payment system updates T records in mobile payment system system of record. 5 Mobile payment system notifies consumer B of payment. 6 Mobile payment system periodically settles between partner banks. This settlement may occur in any periodic time period. Instead of real time the settlement may be performed in a batch mode. For example this may be performed once every 24 hours. The periods do not necessarily have to be equal time periods but may be different time periods.

A specific example of a credit card load. From the web a user enters a credit card number to load 300 into the user s MPS card. The MPS obtains a 300 authorization from Pay By Touch PBT for the credit card transaction. The MPS sends a message to the financial partner supporting the MPS card initiating a 300 person to person payment from the MPS credit card account to the user s debit card account. The user s account is immediately credited with funds. PBT settles the credit card transaction and send a 300 ACH to the MPS settlement account at MPS s bank handling the settlement account. The MPS sends 300 ACH to the MSP credit card master account to replenish the funds.

In a specific embodiment this invention relates to a payment system and more specifically in a specific embodiment to an on line system for transacting payments using mobile phones.

There is a need for an on line system that permits exchange and other transactions of money or other value using mobile phones.

In a person to person payment system existing members of a payment system can send funds to nonmembers who may also be referred to as unregistered users with the intent that the nonmember becomes a member. This ability of a payment system may be referred to as viral because it promotes new member registrations in an exponential spreading fashion.

With respect to a person to person payment system this invention addresses the ability for existing members of a payment system to send funds to nonmembers with the intent that the nonmember becomes a member. This ability of a payment system may be referred to as viral because it promotes new member registrations in an exponential spreading fashion. Some elements of the viral capability include the following which are not listed in any particular order.

 1 A payment system allows existing members to send funds to nonmembers via some unique identifier or id. This unique identifier may be commonly available. Some examples of such identifiers include e mail addresses phone numbers e.g. land line voice over IP mobile phone pager or fax social security numbers account number license plate number instant messenger username and others. The identifier may be selected by a user such as a nonmember choosing a phone number or e mail address.

 2 The payment system notifies the existing member that the send funds transaction that they are about to perform is to a nonmember and give the existing member an opportunity to cancel this transaction as a result.

 3 In the event that the existing member chooses to send funds to a nonmember the payment system must notify the nonmember that funds have been sent to them via various commonly available communication mechanisms such as e mail phone and others .

 4 The payment system should allow the invited nonmember to accept or decline the funds attempting to be sent from the existing member.

 5 If the invited nonmember decides to accept the funds from the existing member then the payment system should provide the ability for the nonmember to register via commonly available communication mechanisms such as e mail phone and others .

 6 In order to complete a viral transaction the payment system will ultimately facilitate a transfer of funds from the existing members account to the new members account.

Below are several embodiments of techniques of performing viral funds transfer within a payment system.

Follow up Payment Reminder. Existing member is reminded of payment upon new member signup. In the examples below Obopay is used as an example of a specific payment system but other payment systems may be used. A payment system may be called or known by any name. The obopay.com web site is specifically identified but any appropriate web site web site name or IP address may be used. Also the invention may be used in the context of other network infrastructures not just the Internet.

1. Existing member user A decides to invite nonmember user B to join by sending B money which B has to claim by enrolling as an member.

2. User A sends a payment transaction to B by inserting B s mobile phone number and the dollar amount. The system does not initially distinguish between payments sent to members and nonmembers.

3. If the mobile phone number is not for a current member user A receives the following message Note Your payment to nonmember is pending. 

4. User A also receives an e mail worded as follows Thank you for your referral. We have contacted your friend and invited them to sign up for our system. 

5. The payment sent to B is debited from A s account and it is held in suspense pending B s enrollment.

6. User B receives a message saying that A has sent them money and that B can get the money by enrolling at obopay.com.

1. Existing member user A decides to invite nonmember user B to join by sending B money which B has to claim by enrolling as a member.

2. User A sends a payment transaction to B by inserting B s mobile phone number and the dollar amount. The system does not initially distinguish between payments sent to members and nonmembers.

3. If the mobile phone number is not for a current member user A receives the following message Note Your payment has been sent to a nonmember user. Would you like us to extend an invitation for them to join Yes No. 

4. If the answer to step 3 is yes user A also receives an e mail worded as follows Thank you for your referral. We have contacted your friend and invited them to sign up for our system. 

6. User B receives a message saying that A has invited B to join the system so that A can send B money.

8. After B successfully enrolls B is notified that A wants to send them money and that B can do a Request Pay for the payment. If B agrees B is shown a prefilled Request Pay transaction with A s phone number and the original payment amount filled in.

Personal Reserved Funds Viral Existing members are allowed to set aside funds that are reserved for viral payments. For example a user may set aside a certain number of dollars of the user s account to settle viral transactions. These funds will not be otherwise available to the user for use in nonviral transactions e.g. spending by debit card . In an implementation the user may change reserved amount through a user account maintenance function.

Conversational Viral The complete viral lifecycle occurs in real time with both parties being notified of the others steps along the way. The ultimate funds transfer is then simply a transfer between two members.

Promissory Viral The existing member promises to pay the invited member if or when they register. The existing member s funds would be reserved for the follow up payment once the invited member registers.

Split Funds Viral The payment system incentivizes existing members to make viral payments by offering a funds split where the payment system matches the payment amount via fixed or percentage amounts.

Request Funds Viral Instead of the existing member sending funds to a nonmember the existing member is requesting funds from a nonmember.

An implementation of the invention may include any of the features described above. In a system of the invention the above embodiments may be implemented individually or in combination with any other embodiment or embodiments.

A specific implementation describes using a mobile telephone number as an identifier for a user. However any identifier may be used for each user such as any phone number e.g. home phone number work phone number voice over IP phone number fax or pager e mail address instant messenger user name social security number driver s license number membership number credit card number debit card number or others.

E mail has been discussed as a technique to send messages between users but other communication techniques may be used including voice mail automated voice messaging instant messages or text messaging. User A and user B have been discussed merely as representative of two of the numerous users a system may have. A system of the invention may have any number of users.

Each unique identifier may be only associated with one user to ensure account and system security. User A may also provide details of the financial transaction such as the amount to be transferred or the form of the payment or combinations of these and a PIN number if requested to validate an account.

The system identifies user A as a member and may check the PIN number validate the account and check the balance for user A s account. In the event that user A s account lacks sufficient funds for the financial transaction the system may send an electronic notification to user A for insufficient funds. If user A s account has sufficient funds for the transaction the system also notifies user B of the pending transaction via mobile technology. Due to the immediate electronic notifications Users A and B received it will seem as though the financial transaction occurs almost instantaneously.

The system may allow users to set preferences regarding acceptance of transactions. If user B has selected an auto accept setting selected when a user registers on the system for automatically accepting payments the funds are transferred from user A s account to user B s account immediately. If user B has selected a manual accept setting the funds are transferred only after user B approves the transaction. The system may also include a setting for users to dictate that they will only accept transactions from specified members or in the converse they will not accept payments from specified members.

If user B has not yet approved the transaction after a certain number of days set by the system such as thirty days the system may automatically cancel the transaction. The system may then send electronic notifications to both user A and user B notifying both of the canceled transaction. User B may also have the option to decline the transaction in which case user A may be notified of the declined payment through electronic notification.

In the event user A has sufficient funds and user B accepts the transaction the amount is debited from user A s account and credited to user B s account. The transactions may be delayed due to inherent delays in the electronic financial transaction system.

Some specific examples of flows are presented in this application. However it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific flow and steps presented. A flow of the invention may have additional steps which may not necessarily described in this application different steps which replace some of the steps presented fewer steps or a subset of the steps presented or steps in a different order than presented or any combination of these.

Further the steps in other implementations of the invention may not be exactly the same as the steps presented. As a specific example the unique or electronic identifier ID is described as user B s mobile number. In other embodiments of the invention the identifier is not limited to user B s telephone number. The identifier may also be user B s instant messenger username or email address in other implementations of the invention.

Another example of a possible variation in the flows without departing from the scope of the invention is the specific messages users A and B receive in various steps in the flows. In other embodiments of the invention these messages may be different from those specifically identified in this application or some messages may not be sent and combinations of these.

In an implementation the system handles near proximity electronic payments such as through the use of NFC Bluetooth RFID infrared beam LED beam or other near proximity technologies. A situation may be that members A and B are physically near each other and they wish to perform an electronic payment. This could be a consumer to consumer or consumer to merchant scenario. This could be a send funds get funds or any other money transfer scenario.

A basic flow of such a transaction is 1 A and B agree to a near proximity electronic payment transaction. 2 B selects make ready for near proximity receive. Device queries for PIN B enters PIN device activates receive mode. 3 A selects make ready for near proximity send. Device queries for PIN A enters PIN device activates send mode. 4 A and B place devices within suitable proximity range. A and B are allowed a limited amount of time to perform this step otherwise devices will timeout. 5 A and B devices recognize each other and transmit payment information to each other. 6 A and B review confirmation dialog on devices and select confirm. 7 Payment transaction commences.

The system allows multichannel and cross channel transactions. In particular payments may be requested from any of the available channels e.g. mobile phone instant messenger e mail Web debit card WAP SMS message or dedicated mobile phone application and the transaction may be directed to any of the available channels in any combination. For example someone may request payment from instant messenger to mobile phone from web to mobile phone from mobile phone to instant messenger from WAP to instant messenger from instant messenger to e mail from e mail to mobile phone from e mail to instant messenger from Web to SMS from SMS to e mail or any other combination. The system may also be used to pay through payment terminals interactive web sites pay for services or media content through television e.g. pay for on demand movies by a cable or satellite provider prepaid phones and many others. For example a user may pay a merchant via instant messenger. The system may support payment to or through vending machines parking meters kiosks pay phones airline ticket kiosks and many others.

Flow A below shows an implementation of performing transaction between a registered user user A member and an unregistered user user B .

In step 1 user A identifies user B to the mobile payment system via user B s mobile phone number. In other implementations of the invention user A may identify user B through other means such as user B s e mail address instant messenger name or other unique identifiers. These identifiers may be electronic identification identifiers and may be identifiers that maybe used to identify B even outside of context of the mobile payment system. In other words the identifier is not necessarily unique to the mobile payment system e.g. account number .

In a specific implementation the mobile payment system does not permit an existing registered user to request payment from an unregistered user. In another embodiment a user may request payment from an unregistered user.

In step 2 the mobile payment system checks whether A s account has sufficient funds to cover the transaction. The mobile payment system may also perform a PIN and account validation or other validation steps to ensure A s account has not been suspended has sufficient funds and so forth. These steps have been omitted from the above flow to improve clarity.

In step 3 the mobile payment system notifies user A of insufficient funds via SMS messaging. In another embodiment of the invention user A may receive this message in other forms such as email SMS messaging or other forms of mobile communication. In some embodiments of the invention the user may not receive this message at all such as the case when user A has decided and indicated to the system not to receive such messages. The flow may also be applied to e mail payment system or other payment systems mobile nonmobile i.e. where a mobile phone is not involved in the transaction or otherwise.

In step 4 the mobile payment system determines user B s is unregistered and notifies user A of this. In another embodiment of the invention the system may allow user A to send payment to user B regardless of user B s unregistered status and thus may skip this step.

In step 5 the mobile payment system places a hold on A s account for the transaction amount. The transaction amount is not debited from A s account until the transaction amount is debited in step 15.

In step 6 unregistered user B is sent a message by the mobile payment system requesting user B s registration with the system. This message may be sent to user B s mobile phone via SMS messaging email MMS messaging instant messaging or other forms of mobile communication.

In step 7 user A is provided the option of being able to cancel the payment before user B accepts it. The payment may also be automatically void if more than 30 days has elapsed after User A sends the payment and before user B accepts the payment. The number of days after which a transaction is automatically canceled may vary. For example the number of days may be any number such as 5 10 14 15 16 21 or more or fewer days than 30. Also users A and B may not receive a message notifying them of the canceled transaction.

In step 8 the system creates an account for user B upon user B s registration. In another embodiment of the invention the system may not require user B to register with the system and may instead automatically link the system to one of user B s bank accounts.

In step 9 user B is only sent a message regarding user A s request to send payment only after user B registers with the system. In another embodiment of the invention user B may receive the message regarding user A s payment without having to register with the system.

In step 10 of the current embodiment user A is sent an SMS message regarding user B s cancellation of the transaction. In another embodiment of the invention the system may send user A a different message and may send it in other forms of mobile communication.

In step 11 B may have options to change or modify the transaction in some way. User B may be provided a yes button no button and request change button. Alternatively the request change button may be referred to as a negotiate button because B is given the opportunity to negotiate with A. B may be given the opportunity to change any term of the transaction. Some terms of the transaction may that B may change include the amount amount select which account the money will be credited to or other.

In step 12 if user B requests a change in the transaction user A is sent a notification regarding the proposed change. User A is given the ability to accept or reject user B s proposed change. In an embodiment of the invention user A may have elected to automatically decline proposed changes in his initial setup with the system. Then user B may be sent a message of user A s automatic declining the change. If user A declines the change whether manually or automatically user B may be given the option to send another proposed change to user A. Or B may be given the opportunity to accept the original transaction.

In step 13 the mobile payment system notifies User A of insufficient funds via SMS messaging. In another embodiment of the invention User A may receive this message in other forms such as email MMS messaging or other forms of mobile communication or may not receive this message at all.

In step 14 user A is sent an SMS notification similar to a receipt notifying him that the transaction was completed. In another embodiment user A may be sent a notification in other forms such as through email instant messenger MMS messaging or other forms of mobile communication. The system may also send user B a notification that the transaction has been completed. The system may also not send users A or B any messages regarding the completion of the transaction.

In step 15 the money transaction takes place. In an implementation credit and debit transactions do not occur in real time. Transactions may take approximately sixty seconds or more to complete after a process is began due to inherent delays in electronic funding systems.

Any number of the steps in flow A in any combination may be combined with any other mobile payment system flow including the other flows discussed in this application.

Flow B below shows another implementation of performing transaction between a registered user user A member and an unregistered user user B .

The implementation in flow B is similar to flow A above. However unlike flow A flow B does not place a hold on the transaction amount in A s account step 5 of flow A . In step 4 of flow B since there is no hold on A s account and A s account is not debited the money is available for user A to spend by mobile payment or debit card payment until the transaction amount is successfully debited from user A s account in step 6.

In step 5 user B is sent a message regarding the transaction and is asked to register with the system.

In step 6 the money is transacted. Such transactions may be asynchronous threads that take approximately sixty seconds or more to complete after a process is started due to inherent delays in electronic funding systems. The amount of delay is indeterminate since various factors influence the delay. Generally the delay is about 60 seconds but if the power grid goes down for example the delay will be much greater.

In particular payment processing of a system may not be performed in a synchronous manner. A certain amount of up front request validation is done. The notifications sent to the consumer may indicate that the request has been accepted and will be processed shortly. The asynchronous server side thread is started to actually process the payment request. In an implementation the asynchronous thread is performed after notifications are sent to the user. This gives the user quicker response regarding the transaction. It is possible the asynchronous part of payment processing may fail. For example this may be because of insufficient funds due to simultaneous card usage. In the event of asynchronous payment processing failure the user is notified.

In an implementation there are two types of pooled accounts an i unregistered user pooled account and a ii no card pooled account. All unregistered users funds will be held together in the unregistered user pooled account. If user A is a no card user who does not yet have an individual account A will have money held instead in the no card pooled account. In another implementation of the invention there may be single pooled account for both the unregistered user pooled and no card pooled accounts. In another embodiment of the invention A and B s accounts are credited and debited in the pooled and transactions at the banking partner partner handling the debit card occurs at the end of the day or another specific time collectively in batch with other system transactions.

In another implementation of the invention there may be a single type of pooled account where both unregistered users and no card users reside. For transfers of money between such users the money will stay within the same pooled account. In a still further implementation of the invention there may be more than two types of pooled accounts.

In step 9 after B registers B becomes as a no card user. As a no card user B can send and receive money like a registered user. However since B has not yet received his card B cannot spend money via the card. In an implementation user B s individual account is created within 24 hours of user B s successful registration. However the account will have no money until it is activated in step 11 below. In another embodiment of the invention a no card pooled account is not used and the money is directly transferred from user A s account to user B s account.

In step 10 it takes typically about 7 to 10 business days to make a new card and for user B to receive it in the mail. In another embodiment of the invention user B may receive another type of card such as a credit card or may elect to receive no card at all.

In step 11 upon user B s activation of his card user B becomes a carded registered user and is no longer a no card user. In an embodiment where a no card pooled account is not used there will not be a need to transfer the balance upon card activation.

Flow C below shows another implementation of performing transaction between a registered user user A member and an unregistered user user B .

The implementation in flow C is similar to flow A above. However unlike flow A flow C does not place a hold on the transaction amount in A s account step 5 of flow A . The discussion above for flows A and B are applicable to flow C as appropriate.

In an implementation while A s payment is pending A may cancel payment and B will be appropriately notified. In step 8 in the case there are multiple pending payments B may be presented with a list of pending payments and requested to indicate acceptance or rejection of each pending payment. If the asynchronous server side thread e.g. step 12 should fail both parties will be notified.

Flow D below shows an implementation of performing transaction between a no card user user A and a no card user user B .

The comments provided above apply to flow D as appropriate. For example in step 3 no hold is placed on A s account for the transaction amount. The transaction amount is not debited from A s account. Until the transaction amount is successfully debited from A s account in a following step the money is available for A to spend by mobile payment or debit card payment.

User B may have a white list or black list set up. The white list may dictate that B will accept payments from only specified users which may be stored in the user s profile . The black list may dictate that B will not accept payments from specified members which may be stored in the user s profile . Various implementations of the invention may have only a white list only a black list or both a white and a black list. Unauthorized senders because of the white or black list will be notified of the error after their attempted payment fails.

Flow E below shows an implementation of performing transaction between a no card registered user user A and a carded user user B .

Flow F below shows an implementation of performing transaction between a carded user user A and a no card user user B .

Flow G below shows an implementation of performing transaction between a carded user user A and a carded user user B .

Flow H shows a referral flow for unregistered users. User A is a registered user and user B is an unregistered user.

The comments provided above apply to flow H as appropriate. In this flow funds are not automatically transferred from A to B after B registers. Rather B is invited to join and upon B s joining A is sent a message step 9 asking if A wants to try to send money to B again. If A wants to send the money then the subsequent A to B will be handled like any of the registered user to registered user transfer.

The implementation may include a referral bonus e.g. 5 . The message in step 4 may include a notice to A that A will receive a referral bonus upon B s joining. After B registers in step 6 user A will be entitled to the referral bonus that is put into A s account see step 8 . Step 8 comes after step 6 but may be before or after steps 7 and 9.

In various implementations of the system referral bonuses may be paid only to the sender only to the recipient or to both the sender and the recipient. Furthermore in an alternative embodiment of a referral flow after B registers the money may be automatically transferred to B without A s need to resend a request pay transaction. In another embodiment the flow is 1 User A Member sends User B not a member X. 2 The system checks B find out B is not a member. 3 X is labeled a pending in A s account. 4 B is notified that B is invited by A to join the system. An incentive of Y money sent by A are waiting to be collected. 5 B chooses to sign up as a member and receives the Y incentive immediately already in the account . 6 B then receives a message indicating that a payment of X was received from A. 7 X is deducted from A s account. 8 The pending Viral can be cancelled by A yet the invite can still be processed. 9 If B does not accept the invite in certain period. The pending amount is then released back to the account

In a further embodiment of the invention the financial exchange system may notify users through multiple notifications per transaction such as with SMS and with email in specific cases. Examples of such cases include upon new user registration upon system card registration upon sending or receiving a referral upon credit debit load upon ACH Direct Deposit load or unload upon eAllowance i.e. bill pay load and upon account or profile data change.

In a mobile payment system registered users or members may send payment to other member or unregistered users or nonmembers. In a specific implementation a person to person payment system allows existing members of a payment system to send funds to nonmembers with the intent that the nonmember becomes a member. This ability of a payment system may be referred to as viral because it promotes new member registrations in an exponential spreading fashion.

In an embodiment the invention is a method including receiving a payment instruction from a first user to pay a second user a money amount where the first user is a registered user and the second user is identified by a telephone number for the second user based on the telephone number determining that the second user is not a registered user and sending a first electronic message to a device associated with the telephone number notifying the second user of the pending payment from the first user. The method includes after sending the first electronic message registering the second user and presenting the second user with an first option to accept the pending payment from the first user and a second option to reject the pending payment from the first user when the second user selects the first option debiting the money amount from a first account associated with the first user and crediting the money amount to a second account associated with the second user and when the second user selects the second option sending a second electronic message to the first user that the payment was declined.

In an implementation the second account is in a pooled account and when the first user is a no card registered user the first account is in the pooled account and the debiting and crediting includes maintaining the money amount within the pooled account. In an implementation the second account is in a pooled account and when the first user is a no card registered user the first account is in the pooled account and the debiting and crediting includes not transferring the money amount outside the pooled account. In an implementation when the first user is a no card registered user the first account is in a first pooled account and the second account is in a second pooled account different from the first pooled account and the debiting and crediting includes transferring the money amount from the first pooled account to the second pooled account.

In an implementation the first user is a carded registered user and the second account is in a pooled account and the debiting and crediting includes transferring the money amount from the first account to the second account in the pooled account whereby the pooled account is increased by the money amount. The card associated with a registered may be a debit card credit card automated teller card or any other physical card showing an account number. Using such a card the first user may conduct transactions independent of the electronic device from which the payment instruction was sent.

In an implementation the method includes receiving in addition to the payment instruction a sequence number generated by a device that sent the payment instruction and after receiving the sequence number generating a transaction number for the payment instruction. In an implementation processing the payment instruction occurs only if the sequence number does not match any previously received sequence number stored in a database. The database may include received sequence numbers for a rolling time period such as the last week the last two weeks the last month the previous six months or any other period of time.

In an implementation after receiving the sequence number an expected sequence number is generated. Then the payment instruction is processed only if the sequence number matches the expected sequence number.

In an embodiment the invention is method including receiving a payment instruction from a first user to pay a second user a money amount where the first user is a registered user and the second user is identified by a telephone number for the second user based on the telephone number determining that the second user is not a registered user and sending a first electronic message to a device associated with the telephone number notifying the second user of the pending payment from the first user. The method includes after sending the first electronic message registering the second user and presenting the second user with an first option to accept the pending payment from the first user a second option to reject the pending payment from the first user and a third option to request a change to the pending payment from the first user when the second user selects the first option debiting the money amount from a first account associated with the first user and crediting the money amount to a second account associated with the second user when the second user selects the second option sending a second electronic message to the first user that the payment was declined.

In implementation the method includes when the second user selects the third option sending a third electronic message to the first user that the second user has requested a change in the pending payment. In an implementation the method includes when the second user selects the third option receiving a request from the second user to change the pending payment to have a different money amount sending a third electronic message to the first user notifying the first user of the change to the pending payment presenting the first user with a fourth option to accept the change to the pending payment or a fifth option to reject the change to the pending payment and when the first user selects the fourth option debiting the different money amount from an account of the first user and crediting the different money amount to an account associated with the second user.

The method may further include after determining the second user is not a registered user placing a hold on the money amount in the first account. The method may include after determining the second user is not a registered user placing a hold on the money amount in the first account and after a certain number of days elapses from the time the payment instruction was received and the second user has not registered removing the hold on the money amount in the first account.

The device may be is at least one of a smartphone mobile telephony device portable e mail device personal digital assistant or computer.

Today s payment systems i.e. credit and debit cards have costs to both consumers and merchants. Consumers may be charged with yearly subscription fees. Merchants are charged heavily with interchange fees. What is needed is a payment system available to consumers and merchants which has no signup fees no subscription fees and no transaction fees for either the consumer or the merchant. Yet at the same time the processor which runs such a system must be compensated accordingly.

In an embodiment the invention provides a method for operating the payment transfer infrastructure as a closed loop payment system. A closed loop financial transaction system facilitates payments without the substantial payment charges associated with closed loop financial systems and has a high level of security for the holder the merchant and others involved in the financial transactions.

A closed loop payment system occurs where the components of the value transfer process take place under the control of the entity who owns the payment system. Because the owner controls the system the underlying pricing is also under the control of the owner. In contrast cash and checks are open payment systems where each participant sets their price for handling their piece of the transaction without a payment to a network operator.

There are several advantages to a closed loop payment system. The primary advantage is that the owner of the system is able to control pricing to both the sender and receiver and there is an interest earnings opportunity on the funds loaded to the system. The payment system owner is able to earn interest on all funds in the system until they are converted or unloaded back to dollars. As more functions are added the closed loop system becomes more profitable due to an increase in fees and balances.

 1 Safety the account holder s money is safely locked in mobile device instead of having to carry cash in a pocket or purse 

Merchant partners have a unique opportunity to earn revenue for handling transactions directed to depositing funds to a prepaid debit account or for providing cash to an account holder. Commissions may be earned by the merchants when funds are added to an account.

The stand alone closed loop payment system of the present invention is designed to integrate with a companion bank account. This account can be a preexisting account or for unbanked users accounts can be created or held in a pooled account with the partner bank.

The closed loop system maintains a user profile database that includes the account holder s name and demographic data information used for underwriting the risk for each specific account holder and linked bank account information for accounts that will be used to load or unload funds from the account. The user profile database also requires a consumer facing and customer service facing website for collection of the enrollment data when accounts are opened.

The payment server maintains a T account record for each account holder. This account is a ledger that keeps track of each account holder s transactions and balances. In conjunction with the T account database the payment server provides history and balance data through the mobile device as well as a consumer and customer service facing web site.

In order to get money into and out of the closed loop payment system the present invention provides for three types of functions for different account holders.

Some account holders will already have a bank account with a bank that is not a partner. The system allows account holders to move funds to and from this bank account through the ACH system or through a direct integration with the account holder s DDA or through an integration through the ATM network. Due to the risk involved the user will be subjected to risk controls that may include deferred availability of transferred funds for example a transfer from your bank account on Monday may not be used until Thursday . This deferral time could be reduced with additional underwriting running credit reports or obtaining financial statements . A reduction in deferral time may also occur due to the user having a good credit record with a partner carrier or guaranteeing payments with a credit card that is held in reserve. In general this approach is not our first choice due to the risk involved unless there is a carrier involved that can deliver some underwriting data and enough customers to justify the additional underwriting.

Where the account holder enrolled as a result of a relationship with a partner bank a real time connection to the Demand Deposit Accounting checking account system enables the account holder to obtain balances and post transactions to their account in real time.

In other instances the account holder maintains an account with a bank e.g. Bancorp Bank or First Premier Bank that operates the bank but web sites checks and customer statements will carry an affinity branding. This approach will allow us to provide the affinity branding with a companion bank account the account will be free to the user in a tightly integrated environment.

The present invention relates to a closed loop financial transaction service having low or no transaction fees and improved security. An embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for fast easy transfer of payments between any peer or between a consumer and merchant. An implementation of the method includes a mobile telephony device cellular telephone cell phone or similar device as the mechanism to access an account such as a prefunded debit account and authorize transfer of funds from that account to another party. Additional embodiments of the present invention encompass a variety of partners that include mobile phone operators nationally branded merchants and financial service providers together with a payment platform that provides a fast easy way to make payments by individuals using their cell phones or other telecommunication device.

Refer now to which shows a closed loop financial transaction system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In this transaction system consumers and merchants a group of two or more consumers or a group of two or more merchants may readily complete financial transactions quickly securely for little or no transaction cost.

This closed loop financial transaction system utilizes prefunded debit account and for this reason may comprise a point of sale POS terminal where traditional debit cards may be used as in the prior art system by swiping the card at the magnetic reader associated with POS terminal . Card provides a second view into the account holder s accounts.

In some embodiments the POS terminal further includes a near field F antenna and circuitry . NF antenna and circuitry detect passive devices such as a NF enabled cell phone a Bluetooth enabled cell phone or other short range transmission device such as RFID or bar codes associated with cell phone . Thus when cell phone is in proximity to the POS terminal account information is automatically to POS terminal. In yet other embodiments the POS terminal includes a cell phone connection that establishes a connection with transaction processor which is also variously referred to as payment server or server upon initiation of a transaction. It is to be understood that transaction processor includes one or more server farms or data centers capable of handling large volumes of simultaneous transactions. As is well understood in the art such server farms are typically geographically dispersed and linked with the appropriate technology to maintain an accurate view of the real time status of all of the accounts. The POS terminal transfers the transaction amount directly from the POS terminal to the payment server for authorization by a cell phone connection . The payment server calls the account holder s cell phone to confirm the transaction details. One skilled in the art will appreciate that POS terminal may include only one or two of the magnetic reader NF antenna and circuit and cell phone . It will also be appreciated that POS terminal is usually associated with a merchant.

One considerable advantage of an embodiment of the present invention is that both cell phone or and the card share a common PIN. Thus the account holder is not inconvenienced by having to recall multiple PINs.

In addition to consumer to merchant transactions the present invention is flexible enough to implement true person to person financial transaction capabilities. Person to person devices each comprise a cell phone that is linked to an account and an account holder. When one of the peers desires to initiate a transaction request such as to send a payment to another peer the request authorization and confirmation of the transaction are all sent between payment server and the peers over a public network. Advantageously since one or more public networks are utilized there is no interchange fee so cost to the participants can be either free or so cheap as to comprise a negligible percentage of the overall transactions conducted on the system especially compared to the typical interchange fee.

As noted above transaction requests are routed to a payment server over a public network. In one embodiment the public network is the Internet. In another embodiment the public network is the cellular telephone network. In yet another embodiment the public network is a radio network and in yet another embodiment it is the public switched telephone network or PSTN. The public network transfers the account holder transaction requests to the payment server .

In an implementation the connection over the public network is a secure link that relies on authenticated participants and encryption. Thus for connections over the Internet the connection protocol may be HTTPS and the link may be a virtual private network or VPN. Payment server is also connected to linked deposit accounts either over the public network not illustrated or over a proprietary ACH banking or financial network.

In alternative embodiments cell phone includes a near field communication NFC circuit Bluetooth circuit or RFID circuit not shown that enables POS terminal to query and recover account information such as the cell phone telephone number. In this embodiment the merchant would automatically detect the account information and send the request to payment server . The payment server would again call the cell phone to request the PIN or other biometric identification and payment authorization.

Person to person transactions eliminate the POS terminal from the process with each peer and contacting payment server directly to conclude the financial transaction.

One method for operating a payment transfer infrastructure in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is as a closed loop payment system. A closed loop payment system occurs where all of the components of the value transfer process take place under the control of the entity who owns the payment system. Because the owner controls the system the underlying pricing is also under the control of the owner.

There are several advantages to a closed loop payment system. The primary advantage is that the owner of the system is able to control pricing to both the sender and receiver and there is an interest earnings opportunity on the funds loaded to the system. The payment system owner is able to earn interest on all funds in the system until they are converted or unloaded back to dollars. As more functions are added the closed loop system becomes more profitable due to an increase in fees and balances.

 1 Safety the account holder s money is safely locked in mobile device instead of having to carry cash in a pocket or purse 

Merchant partners have a unique opportunity to earn revenue for handling transactions directed to depositing funds to a prepaid debit account or for providing cash to an account holder. Merchants may earn commissions when funds are added to an account using their POS terminal.

The stand alone closed loop payment system of the present invention is designed to integrate with a companion bank account. This account can be a preexisting account or for users that do not have an existing bank account a partner bank may create an account.

The closed loop system maintains a user profile database that includes the account holder s name and demographic data information used for underwriting the risk for each specific account holder and linked bank account information for accounts that will be used to load or unload funds from the prepaid debit account. The user profile database also requires a consumer facing and customer service facing website for collection of the enrollment data when opening an account. Advantageously the present closed loop system interfaces with the credit card interchange system to access credit lines available under a credit card account.

The payment server maintains a T account record for each account holder. This account is a ledger that keeps track of each account holder s transactions and balances. In conjunction with the T account database the payment server provides history and balance data through the mobile device as well as a consumer and customer service facing web site. The T account database is real time record that records transactions as they occur. This means that when a transaction occurs the sender of funds can observe the balance in their account immediately decrease while the recipient can observer the instantaneous increase in their account balance. There is no ACH or other transfer related delay in moving funds between accounts.

In order to get money into and out of the closed loop payment system the present invention provides for three types of functions for different account holders.

Some account holders will already have a bank account with a bank that is not a partner. The system allows account holders to move funds to and from this bank account through the ACH system. Due to the risk involved the user will be subjected to risk controls that may include deferred availability of transferred funds for example a transfer from your bank account on Monday may not be used until Thursday . This deferral time could be reduced with additional underwriting running credit reports or obtaining financial statements . A reduction in deferral time may also occur due to the user having a good credit record with a partner carrier or guaranteeing payments with a credit card that is held in reserve. In general this approach is not intended to be a primary choice due to the risk involved with the transfer of funds from outside the closed loop financial transaction system unless there is a carrier involved that can deliver some underwriting data and enough customers to justify the additional underwriting.

Where the account holder enrolled because of a relationship with a partner bank a real time connection to the Demand Deposit Accounting checking account savings or other account such as a money market account system enables the account holder to obtain balances and post transactions to their account in real time.

In other instances the account holder maintains an account with Bancorp Bank or similar financial institution which operates the bank but all web sites checks and customer statements will carry an affinity branding. This approach allows affinity branding with a companion bank account the account will be free to the user in a tightly integrated environment.

For transaction fees over the selected maximum the account holder sending initiating a pay transaction would incur certain fees as indicated at . To illustrate for transactions amounts that are between 50 and 1100 the account holder would incur a transaction fee of 1.00 by way of example. For amounts over a selected amount such as over 100 a higher fee may be charged or negotiated. These fees are considerably less than the per transaction fee charged by credit card issuers. In an alternative embodiment the transaction fee may be a nominal amount such as a penny 0.05 or 0.10 that is charged to the sender.

For transactions that involve a merchant the merchant may optionally offer to pay the transaction fee that would otherwise be charged to the consumer as indicated at . In addition the merchant is charged an additional fee to receive funds. Again the actual amount of the merchant transaction fee can vary but in one embodiment is a nominal 1 percent of the transaction amount.

A nominal monthly service charge is in one embodiment added to the billings for the cell phone user by the mobile service provider as indicated at . The mobile service provider and the owner of the closed loop financial transaction system of the present invention share the monthly service charge on a pro rata basis.

A member supported payment system is provided to consumers and merchants without sign up fees subscription fees or transaction fees to either consumers or merchants. In a specific implementation the member payment system is a mobile payment system where consumers may conduct transactions using a mobile device such as a mobile telephone smartphone personal digital assistant or similar portable wireless handheld device. Merchants will make a refundable one time contribution. These contributions are stored in a pooled trust account by the system and the float dividends or interest on these contributions will fund the system.

In a specific implementation the member supported payment system MSPS provides a completely free payment system to consumers and merchants using the following principles 

6. The MSPS trust account generates float dividends which provides the compensation for the MSPS processing company and system.

7. Consumers and merchants can load and unload from a pooled MSPS working account separate from trust account .

9. The MSPS system manages the T account i.e. balance debits credits for consumer and merchant accounts.

In an embodiment the invention is a method including receiving a plurality of merchant contributions to fund a member payment system placing the merchant contributions into a pooled trust account where merchants will not receive interest on their contributions permitting a plurality of consumers to become registered users of the mobile payment without charge permitting registered users to load or unload funds into a working account of the member payment system without charge and permitting merchants to load or unload funds into the working account of the member payment system without charge where interest on pooled trust account funds the member payment system.

In an implementation the merchant contribution may be a paid in installments over a period of time. Depending on the amount of the contribution the merchant will have greater access or privileges in the system. For example there may be set levels of contributions which correspond to a number of transactions a merchant will be entitled to without additional fee. Also the merchant may make a subsequent contribution to increase the merchant s privileges.

In an implementation the member payment system permits a registered user to request payment of money to another register user via a mobile phone. The member payment system may permit a registered user to request payment of money to a merchant via a mobile phone.

The member payment system may manage transactions records of the registered users. The member payment system manages transactions records of the merchants. The member payment system may manage transactions records of the registered users and merchants. This will reduce the costs to the merchants since they do not need to manage their own transactions records.

The contribution is refundable so the merchant can decide later not to participate. For example when a merchant requests a refund of the merchant s contribution to the member payment system registered users will no longer be permitted to transfer money to the merchant.

Generally the merchant is not charged a periodic recurring transaction fee for being a participant of the member payment system. The system is funded by the float on the pooled trust containing the merchant s contributions.

Registered users may load or unload funds by way of at least one of Automated Clearing House ACH or direct deposit account DDA . In further implementations of the system the registered users and merchants may be provided numerous additional ways to load and unload funds. For example a registered user may choose to have the user s paycheck or a portion of the paycheck directly deposited into the system.

In an implementation the method includes permitting a registered user to authorize paying a merchant through the member payment system by using a two factor authorization scheme. These two factors of authorization may include 1 what the person has e.g. phone card and 2 what the person knows e.g. PIN mother s maiden name challenge question . For example the system may permit a registered user to authorize paying a merchant through the member payment system by using a mobile phone of the registered user and the user correctly entering a personal identification number or PIN.

Optionally each registered user may also be provided a debit card. With the debit card users may make charges without for example a mobile phone.

Referring to in a specific implementation of the invention to avoid keeping general ledgers for each bank the mobile payment system will keep one general ledger for the virtual pooled account for each country. This reduces the settlement and operational costs of the system. Since money will be held in the virtual pooled account the owner of the virtual pooled account e.g. the mobile payment system service operator will receive the float or interest on this money. The recipient of the float on the virtual pooled account may distribute some amounts to the partner banks who are no longer receiving the float on their general ledgers .

 1 Accounts that are acquired by the partner bank will be recognized as coming from that bank. For example if bank Ci markets the mobile payment system service and recruits customer A then customer A for it s lifetime will be marked as Recruited by Ci. For each user record discussed elsewhere in this application there may be a field indicating from which source that particular user was recruited from. Some examples of possible sources include the mobile payment service directly partner bank partner financial institution and partner mobile phone provider.

At the end of each day the mobile payment system service will estimate the amount of funds held in the mobile payment system service accounts that are marked as recruited by each partner bank. Let s call this estimated amount to be X Ci X BA X ING where Ci BA and ING are examples of financial institutions or banks.

For example in member 6504044762 was recruited by first bank Ci while member 4154443214 was recruited by third bank BA. In this example the members are identified by phone number. Examples of phone numbers for the United States include 4158675309 or 2128675309. In an implementation of the invention the phone number format may be entered excluding the area code such as 7762323 or 5550123. For example this may used the situation the recipient is in the same area code as the sender. The system would fill in the additional area code digits automatically. As has been stated elsewhere in this application members may be identified by other types of identifiers such as instant messenger user name e mail address social security number driver s license number account number and others.

 2 Let s call the remainder Y. This is the estimated amount of funds to be held in mobile payment system service accounts that have not been marked as recruited. These are accounts that were recruited by mobile payment system service direct or nonbank partners. In this is represented by phone number 6508622730 which is indicated as being recruited by second bank MSPS the mobile payment system service provider .

 3 Each day perhaps at a designated time mobile payment system service will calculate the appropriate funds to be held in a partner bank. For example it may be according to the following formula X partner bank plus a percentage of Y. The percentage will be negotiated at the time the bank partnership is established and will depend on the level of marketing spend. For example for Ci the mobile payment system service might put 10 percent of Y in the mobile payment system service account for Ci. The percentage may be any percentage such as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 or others. The percentage may be a whole number or fractional number including 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.5 less than 1 less than 2 less than 3 less than 6 and others.

This method is designed to avoid the cost of keeping multiple general ledgers and exact net settlement. It also will give the partner bank more than their fair share of mobile payment system service funds.

A virtual pooled account is used in operating a system having multiple financial partners. In a specific implementation the system is a mobile banking system. Instead of maintaining separate general ledgers for each financial institution the system will keep one general virtual pooled account. This will reduce the settlement and operational costs of the system. The owner of the virtual pooled account will receive the float on the virtual pooled account and this float will be distributed to the multiple financial partners according to a formula.

In an embodiment the invention is a method including handling financial transactions of a group of users of a system where the financial transactions may be specified through mobile phones and subgroups of the users are associated with a banking institution processing financial transactions associated with a first banking institution where users in a first subgroup are associated with the first banking institution processing financial transactions associated with a second banking institution where users in a second subgroup are associated with the second banking institution processing financial transactions associated with a third banking institution where users in a third subgroup are associated with the third banking institution maintaining a virtual pooled account including funds for the first second and third subgroup users associated with the first second and third banking institutions and distributing a first dividend to the first banking institution based on float for funds in the virtual pooled account for the first subgroup users plus a percentage of float on funds in the virtual pooled account for the third subgroup users.

In an implementation the method includes distributing a second dividend to the second banking institution based on float for funds in the virtual pooled account for the second subgroup users plus a percentage of float on funds in the virtual pooled account for the third subgroup users. In an implementation the method includes receiving an instruction from a first user in the first subgroup to transfer money to a second user in the second subgroup where money is not transferred outside the virtual pooled account. The instruction may be wirelessly sent from a mobile phone via SMS messaging. The instruction may be wirelessly sent from a mobile phone using an application executing on the mobile phone.

The third banking institution may be a direct partner of the system. In an implementation the method includes each user is associated with only one of the first second or third financial institutions. In an implementation the method includes managing a system of record for virtual pooled account where the system of record includes records of transactions for users in the first second and third subgroups.

In an embodiment the invention is a method including handling financial transactions of a group of users of a system where the financial transactions may be specified through mobile phones and subgroups of the users are associated with a banking institution processing financial transactions associated with a first banking institution where users in a first subgroup are associated with the first banking institution processing financial transactions associated with a second banking institution where users in a second subgroup are associated with the second banking institution processing financial transactions users in a third subgroup that are associated with the system and not the first and second banking institutions maintaining a virtual pooled account including funds for the first second and third subgroup users associated with the first and second banking institutions and the system and distributing a first dividend to the first banking institution based on float for funds in the virtual pooled account for the first subgroup users plus a percentage of float on funds in the virtual pooled account for the third subgroup users.

In an implementation the method includes distributing a second dividend to the second banking institution based on float for funds in the virtual pooled account for the second subgroup users plus a percentage of float on funds in the virtual pooled account for the third subgroup users. In an implementation the method includes receiving an instruction from a first user in the first subgroup to transfer money to a second user in the second subgroup where money is not transferred outside the virtual pooled account. The instruction may be wirelessly sent from a mobile phone via SMS messaging. The instruction may be wirelessly sent from a mobile phone using an application executing on the mobile phone. The instruction may be sent via an Internet browser.

In an implementation each user is associated with only one of the first financial institution second financial institution or the system. In an implementation the method includes receiving an instruction from a first user in the first subgroup to transfer money to a second user in the third subgroup where money is not transferred outside the virtual pooled account. In an implementation the method includes managing a system of record for virtual pooled account where the system of record includes records of transactions for users in the first second and third subgroups.

In another embodiment the account holder has the option to select a deliver to the current geographical location rather than the account holder s billing address. This feature is of particular desirability when the account holder is traveling and desires to order from a room service menu but does not wish to speak to anyone. In this case the menu would include a near field communication device so the account holder would only need to select the Buy Request and the food would be delivered to the room where the account holder is located.

To minimize the verification processing time the merchant may be notified of the preauthorization in advance of expected use. Upon receipt of the preauthorization the telephone number may be placed on a green list which indicates that the merchant can accept payment without verification from the payment server. The green list is stored at POS terminals or is accessible to POS terminals from a local server rather than from the transaction server.

If a preauthorized account is depleted and the account holder has not timely replenished the account the telephone number may be placed on a red list and prohibited from future use of the service. The red list may also be stored locally by the merchant at the POS or stored in a local server coupled to the POS equipment. If a telephone number is included in the red list the merchant can accept an alternative form of payment. Alternatively the server may deny the service and send a message suggesting that the account holder take this opportunity to recharge the account holder s account. The merchant may accept the recharge payment and collect the incentive fee for receiving the funds for recharging the account holder s account.

In order to speed up preauthorized purchases in one embodiment the cell phone includes an externally visible bar code that can be scanned at the POS to both initiate and conclude a transaction. Alternatively the bar code may be displayed on the screen of the cell phone and scanned in at the POS. Because speed and convenience is so important for many daily purchases the bar code together with the locally cached green list enables merchants to accept the purchase on the fly and then submit the transaction in a batch mode at selected intervals.

An advantage to the account holder is that if the cell phone is lost the preauthorization can be quickly suspended either by accessing a web page to update the user profile or by calling customer service. If a phone is reported as missing new green and red lists are immediately distributed to the affected merchants thereby limiting potential losses for the account holder and the merchant. Compare to the loss of a prepaid monthly transit pass that is lost if lost the entire value of the pass is also lost and the finder reaps the benefits of the find. Thus the green and red lists are an effective tool in preventing fraud through theft of loss of the phone with respect to preauthorized accounts.

Since every cell phone in use today is not application equipped the payment server adapts to the level of service available for each account holder. One method for communicating messages between cell phone devices is to transmit and receive using Short Message Service which is also commonly referred to as SMS text messaging or simply SMS because most mobile devices support SMS. SMS is a mechanism for delivering short messages over mobile networks. It is a store and forward way of transmitting messages to and from mobiles. The message text only from the sending mobile is stored in a server associated with SMS transport system which then forwards it to the destination mobile at a later time. This means that if the recipient is not available the message is stored and sent later. Since SMS used signaling channel as opposed to dedicated channels these messages can be sent received simultaneously with the voice service over the mobile network. With the mobile networks based on all three cellular technologies with GSM CDMA and TDMA supporting SMS SMS is now a widely available mobile data service.

With SMS an SMS aggregator routes the messages between the payment server and the account holder in real time and the funds are immediately available for use by the recipient. If the financial transaction includes another party the server also uses SMS to communicate with the other party in real time again using the SMS aggregator. SMS is a particularly important mechanism when a nonaccount holder is the recipient of a payment transfer from an account holder. A problem for the nonaccount holder is the lack of the MCA embedded in their phone so SMS is a mechanism for communicating with the nonaccount holder. The MCA manages and inserts a transaction number that includes idemopotent keys that make the transaction number unique for data services SMS HTTP and HTTPS protocol messages but there is no transaction number when using manual SMS.

An SMS mobile financial transaction system avoids the expense and problems associated with having a special chip i.e. an integrated circuit device added solely to support and enable financial functionality of a device. Adding additional components to a cell phone or other mobile device increases costs to the manufacture and support in the field. Costs are further increased if use of the chip requires licensing fees or other proprietary fees. Further adding a chip to the cell phone increases power consumption and degrades battery life both having negative consequences for mobile devices such as cell phones.

While SMS text messaging works well with most all types of cell devices and certain other types of mobile communication devices such as portable digital assistants or PDAs SMS exposes unencrypted passwords or personal identification numbers PINs as well as balance information or details about the most recent transaction. Since anyone in possession of the phone can read the SMS message file and immediately know how to access the account of another the present invention. Accordingly in one embodiment the present invention provides for the initiation of the financial transaction by way of SMS text message with a portion of the transaction concluded over a voice channel.

If an Internet connection is not available the use of the SMS or Short Message Service messages is used in one embodiment. In one embodiment the mobile client application utilizes the data services function to send binary SMS messages. In another embodiment where the mobile client application is not available plain text SMS messages are used to conduct financial transactions with special arrangements being taken to protect the integrity of the PIN. It will be yet further appreciated that the lack of the mobile client application further limits the user interface capabilities so the user may derive limited satisfaction from the present invention but would however otherwise enjoy the full features and benefits of the present financial transaction system.

With the present invention the mobile client application selects the mode to transmit the financial transaction to server also referred to as the transaction processor . For example if an Internet connection is available the transaction is conducted using a HTTPS link which is a web protocol that encrypts and decrypts user page requests as well as the pages that are returned by server . To use the Internet the account holder merely enters in the transaction details onto a web page and selects send to initiate the transaction. If another party involved and that party has a web enabled device the transaction details are provided on a web page. In this embodiment server functions as a web server.

Typically not all account holders have an Internet enabled cell phone or device. Therefore the present invention provides for other methods to conduct financial transactions from the cell phone. Such methods include the use of SMS data services SMS plain text both of which may employ a voice channel to transmit the PIN or voice channel only.

For an SMS capable cell phone the account holder transmits an SMS message over SMS gateway to server to initiate a transaction from their cell phone as indicated by flow arrow . Gateway relays the SMS message to server as indicated by flow arrow . Upon receipt of the SMS message server takes the specified action requested in the message and sends a reply SMS message to gateway as indicated by flow arrow . Gateway relays the reply SMS message to cell phone as indicated by flow arrow . This sequence of events may proceed for several iterations until a financial transaction is completed. SMS messages may be carried between phones and gateway by any circuit switched or packet switched network.

In some embodiments a voice communication channel is established as indicted by voice channels and . When an initial SMS message is received from phone server may open up voice channel by dialing the telephone number associated with the account. One instance where voice channel is used is to obtain a PIN received as either DTMF or voice data to complete the verification process and authenticate the user as the account holder in response to an SMS message. DTMF refers to dual tone multifrequency the signal a telephone company receives when a telephone s touch keys are pressed.

The initial SMS message starts with a key word that provides the type of transaction requested PAY REQUEST PAYMENT BALANCE TRANSFER or HELP. Where the SMS message contains the key word that indicates a desire to transfer funds from one account holder to another the key word would be either pay or request payment. After the key word the amount is entered with or without a decimal point. After the amount the target telephone number or short code e mail address or other identifying information is entered. This information may be automatically obtained from the telephone directory of the mobile device. After the telephone number the account holder may enter in a message in a message field for display to the other party. In some circumstances this message may be a null message. In some embodiments the account holder may also enter a supplemental message for record keeping purposes. A special code in the message field delineates the supplemental message to indicate that the text following the special code is private and not to be forwarded. Examples of representative special code may be or or other unique user defined codes.

Once the SMS message is sent to the server the PIN is entered by the account holder and sent through a voice channel connection to the server to verify the SMS message. The PIN is entered in via the keyboard and may be any alphanumeric code. The PIN is then sent to the payment sever as a DTMF encoded message.

At the server the server receives the SMS message via the SMS text message communication path and the PIN through the voice channel. The call to the server may be made by the account holder or it may be initiated as a call back feature by the payment server in response to receipt of the SMS message. It is desirable that the PIN be sent as a DTMF encoded message to maintain security although in other embodiments the PIN may be spoken by the account holder and converted by a interactive voice recognition software module operating on the payment server or another server not shown dedicated to the handling voice calls.

To illustrate consider the process that occurs when account holder using cell phone requests an account balance using an SMS message addressed to server . The SMS message is formatted by the user to include the type of financial transaction requested that is BALANCE an acceptable short form of the request may be BAL or simply B and the telephone number associated with their account for example 4088675309 e.g. Jenny s phone number . Alternatively the account number may be determined by using the Caller ID.

When server receives the SMS message it initially checks the sequence or transaction number see for example and . If the sequence number is correct server dials the telephone number associated with the account and requests the user to enter a PIN. In other embodiments the PIN is included in the original SMS message so there is no need to call the account holder for verification. If the cell phone is sufficient configured with an mobile client application it is possible to encrypt the password before including it in the SMS message. The mobile client application will use data services. The downside of using the SMS message to transport the PIN is that this secret number will be visible to anyone who has access to the phone and could lead to unauthorized use by a nonaccount holder.

If the PIN is correct server handles the requested transaction. The user may elect to receive the requested information by voice response over voice channel or by return SMS message in which case server sends a message with the balance amount to gateway which in turn forwards it on to cell phone .

In other financial transactions there are two cell phones and involved. These types of financial transactions typically have an account holder transfer funds to a recipient who may be an account holder associated with cell phone . In other transactions the recipient is a nonaccount holder.

As with the BAL request a request to PAY the user of cell phone is initiated by using an SMS message addressed to server . The SMS message is formatted to include the type of financial transaction requested that is PAY and the recipient s telephone number e.g. 2127875466 and the telephone number associated with their account again for example 4088675309. If the account holder s phone supports the mobile client application then all SMS messages exchanged between cell phone and server may be encrypted for added security.

When server receives the SMS message it initially checks the sequence or transaction number if available and proceeds only if the sequence number is correct or is indicated as unavailable in the account record maintained by the server. Server then receives and determines if the PIN is correct. If both the sequence number and the PIN are correct server handles the requested transaction by debiting the account associated with the account holder see e.g. and sending a confirmation SMS message to the account holder over gateway .

If recipient is an account holder server also sends a confirmation message confirming receipt of the funds. If the cell phone is a mobile PDA or other IP enabled device the message is sent by HTTPS and may be encrypted to ensure security. Encryption may be by any known method.

If recipient is an account holder with the mobile client application installed the mobile client application may encrypt its messages before sending it to server and receive encrypted messaged from server .

If recipient is an account holder but the cell phone does not support the downloading and execution of the mobile client application on the cell phone then the messages from server will be in plain text. A downside of using the plain text SMS message to transport the PIN is that this secret number will be visible to anyone who subsequently gains access to the phone. This could lead to unauthorized use by a nonaccount holder unless the account holder takes the time to delete the SMS messages from their cell phone s mailbox. If recipient is not an account holder then the SMS messages will also be a plain text message.

While SMS text messaging works well with cell phones and certain other types of mobile communication devices such as portable digital assistants or PDAs SMS exposes unencrypted passwords or personal identification numbers PINs as well as balance information or confidential details about the most recent transaction. Since anyone in possession of the phone can read the SMS message file and immediately know how to access the account of another and the other confidential information it is best to avoid using public SMS messages to transmit the PIN.

Thus for the mobile device issued by a partner service provider it is desirable that the mobile devices include the mobile client application as a preexisting software module. Alternatively the mobile client application is preferably downloadable from the service provider to cell phones that were not originally equipped with the mobile client application. The mobile client application enables significant enhancements to the use of the financial transaction system. The mobile client application is invoked either directly by the account holder or in response to activation of the SMS text messaging feature on the mobile device.

The following is a detailed description illustrating use of SMS text messaging to provide account holders access to the payment server from any SMS capable mobile phone or other SMS enabled device in an embodiment where the mobile client application is available.

In operation the account holder sends a text message to server using the existing text message capability on their phone. The functionality includes Pay Request Pay Balance History and Help invoked by using any of these features as a keyword. The account holder enters the keyword together with additional information in the body of the text message to construct a command that is then sent to the server. Access to the server may be by way of a toll free telephone number a short code or an e mail address all of which identify the server to the SMS gateway. An example of a short code is 62729 which is used as the target phone number for their text message commands to the payment server. An example of an e mail address is sms obopay.com which is the e mail target for SMS text message commands sent to the server.

To send a payment to another person or a merchant using the SMS method the account holder would enter the command string shown in table C.

Each item should have a space between it and the previous item. In one implementation the keyword is not case sensitive. The mobile number should include area code plus mobile number with no spaces present in the mobile number. The account holder may enter a leading 1 or not on the phone number. A dollar sign is not required to be entered with the amount but should be allowed. The user may optionally include a message with their payment. The MCA encrypts the message and sends as a data services SMS message in binary rather than plain text.

In an alternative example the PIN is sent in a second message by way of a voice call. To send a payment to another person or a merchant using the combined SMS plus voice channel method the account holder would enter the command string shown in table D.

Upon receipt of the SMS message server calls the cell phone associated with the SMS message to establish a voice channel to acquire the PIN. The PIN is sent to server over the voice communication channel that is the cellular network. In alternative embodiments the PIN is sent over the Internet or POTS.

When a request for payment is made to an account holder using either the SMS method or the combined SMS plus voice method they may either accept or decline the request using the manual SMS text messaging system.

On the server side one or more data centers would have systems for processing the financial transactions. Each data centers would contain a combination of PBX ACD VRU technology to allow multiple simultaneous call processing. The VRU technology can be used to provide programmable inbound and outbound DTMF support. The VRU can be connected to an enterprise J2EE system which represent the actual business logic and system of record for the financial transactions. The J2EE system can then integrate with actual banks for settlement of the transactions.

Advantageously the mobile client application determines a preferred or best method for sending the PIN such as by application SMS data services where the SMS message is encrypted and converted to binary i.e. the message is not transmitted in plain text or by voice channel using DTMF to maintain security. In other embodiments the PIN may be spoken by the account holder and converted by an interactive voice recognition software module operating on the server or another server not shown dedicated to handling voice calls.

In one alternative embodiment the PIN is encrypted by the mobile client application and included in a subsequent SMS message that is sent to server . Server correlates the messages by matching the telephone number and the time each message was sent. If the PIN was sent in a message that was distant in time compared to the SMS message the transaction may be rejected. If only one of the two messages is received the transaction may be rejected. If however both the SMS message with the financial transaction details minimum of at a keyword and the PIN code are timely received and are verified then the financial transaction proceeds.

In an alternative embodiment when a voice channel is available the mobile client application may invoke a module to encode the PIN into DTMF form. The DTMF is then sent by the MCA to the payment server along a voice channel connection established by the mobile client application. The module may be a Java API that generates the appropriate tones based on keypad input. DTMF refers to dual tone multifrequency the signal a telephone company receives when a telephone s touch keys are pressed.

In yet another alternative embodiment the mobile client application provides a user interface UI on the display screen of the mobile device to guide the account holder for concluding the financial transaction. In this embodiment the account holder is guided through the process of constructing the SMS text message by the automatic insertion of the keyword amount target telephone number password and messages if any.

In yet another alternative embodiment the SMS message may include the keyword the amount the target telephone number and the password. A shortcoming of this implementation is that the password would be visible to anyone controlling the mobile device. However the present invention manages this problem by sending a message to the account holder to delete the sent message from the SMS log folder on the account holder s phone. The message may also suggest that the account holder to turn off message logging outgoing SMS messages when conducing financial transactions using the SMS feature in the future.

Rather than use plain text SMS messages the present invention also contemplates an embodiment using a JAVA APIs downloaded to the cell phone to conduct the financial transactions. The JAVA APIs generate user interface screens to guide the user in preparing the transaction request. The message format is similar to that illustrated in table C or table D.

Once the account holder has completed the transaction request the user selects a SEND option presented on the user interface. The JAVA APIs initiates a voice call using the cellular telephone connection to access an interactive voice recognition IVR module or DTMF interface on server . When the DTMF interface picks up the call the JAVA APIs transmit the transaction request using DTMF tones. The JAVA APIs may also use a form of encryption so that the DTMF tones are not easily decipherable should they be surreptitiously recorded. When the IVR provides a response to the transaction request the response is also encrypted and then encoded using DTMF and transmitted over the voice channel back to the appropriate party. Due to the increased security aspects of the JAVA APIs this embodiment is compared to sending plain text SMS.

Therefore communication can be by way of a voice channel and DTMF tones. This provides a further communications channel in addition to SMS data services or application SMS HTTP and HTTPS to perform transactions. By having many communications channels this provides greater reliability in the system because any channel may be used when other channels are not available.

Generator comprises an electrical circuit that is inserted into the phone electrically connected to SIM card . In one embodiment generator is a sleeve that is inserted around SIM card . Alternatively generator is a shim that is interposed between the cell phone s transmitting module and SIM card . SIM card is the Subscriber Identity Module card which is an electronic card that is inserted into a cell phone or other GSM GPRS or G based mobile device and identifies the subscriber to the network.

Although SIM cards are most widely used in GSM systems compatible modules are also used for UMTS UEs USIM and IDEN phones. SIM card contains the personal identification number of the subscriber information such as the user s phone number phone book SMS messages as well as other information related to the subscriber.

Generator intercepts incoming SMS messages looking for messages from server see . When generator detects an SMS message sent by server it functions in the manner of the mobile client application by decrypting the SMS data service message and presenting a plain text message for the account holder.

Generator also intercepts outgoing SMS messages that are targeted to server . Again generator functions to provide the services of the mobile client application by adding a transaction number to each transaction and encrypts the SMS message. Because generator contains an embedded software module it can send the SMS message as a data service SMS message rather than plain text.

Generator is intended to be sold or otherwise provided as a separate component allowing non MCA equipped cell phones to reap the advantages of having the mobile client application resident on the cell phone. In other embodiments SIM includes the generator as an on board circuit and is provided to the user by the cell phone s service provider.

Refer now to which shows a registration process for a new account holder in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. When the recipient of funds is not already an account holder one embodiment of the present invention invokes a viral form of new customer acquisition where the existing account holders bring in new account holders by simply sending funds to nonaccount recipients. The nonaccount recipient receives an SMS message stating that they have funds available and inviting them to register access to the funds as indicated at . A web address is provided.

Registration may occur at any bank partner or on line at a web page accessed over the Internet as indicated at . The registration process enables the recipient to open a prefunded using the transferred funds debit account. This process is similar to opening any other bank account except there is no minimum account balance so even individuals who do not qualify for a checking or savings account at a bank may participate.

Once registered the new account holder has a no card restricted account as indicated at . At this stage phase I the new account holder has the ability to view the funds in their prepaid debit account in real time. However due to banking regulations the new account holder s account access to the funds are restricted pending completion of a OFAC report as indicated at . OFAC refers to the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries terrorists unapproved international narcotics traffickers and those engaged in activities related to the unapproved proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Reviewing the account holder against a suspect lists is an essential step in the OFAC compliance program. If an account holder s is flagged as a potential match with the OFAC list an investigation is initiated to determine if it is in fact a true match. Until resolved the funds are not released. Commercially available software packages are available for the compliance check. The compliance check can also identify duplicate customer records establish links between individuals and corporations for traditional and nontraditional householding create a multifunction Household key to track changes over time and establish rules based processing to resolve duplicates and create links and households.

Once the OFAC compliance is complete a process that typically takes about 24 hours and no adverse links identified the account holder becomes a no card account which means the financial institution can open a prefunded debit card account and order a plastic debit card sent the new account holder as indicated at . However at this stage phase II the new no card account holder has only limited availability of the funds. For example the new account holder may transfer funds to other individuals using the financial transaction system of the present invention but because of additional governmental restrictions funds may not be withdrawn or transferred to a merchant.

At a back end processing portion of a system of the invention a pooled holding account holds transferred funds if the recipient is not already an account holder. A ledger entry identifies see funds attributed to each phone number. These funds can be transferred to other accounts by the recipient if they register for an account. Because individuals cannot be compelled to register for an account it is possible for the recipient to proactively refuse the funds or simply fail to respond. In such instances the funds are returned to the account holder that initiated the transaction after the transaction window has expired the transaction window may be a selected duration such as 30 days or 60 days or immediately upon a proactive refusal. The transaction server may send periodic reminder messages to both the sender of the funds and the recipient. In other instances the sender of the funds can stop payment if the recipient has not registered to gain access to the funds. This feature is important where the parties agree to cancel the electronic transfer and conclude the transaction in another manner for example using cash.

If funds for all account holders are held in the pooled account then when a new account goes live the new account holder has full and immediate access to the funds. If funds are held in separate accounts for each account holder the funds are transferred from the holding account to the account holder s account when the account goes live. There may be some delay for the funds to appear in the individual account.

Once the account is opened and compliance checks passed the financial institution requests a plastic debit card to be sent to the address of record for the new account holder. When the card arrives the account holder calls a toll free telephone number to confirm receipt. The confirming telephone call also indicates that the address for the account holder is correct.

During this call the account holder also selects their PIN. The PIN is linked to both the card and to the telephone number of the account holder s mobile phone. Further the account number on the plastic debit card and the phone are locked together. The card may be used to withdraw cash from the account or to deposit cash into the account using any banking ATM. It may also be used at any merchant location where a POS device accepts credit and bank cards. At this stage phase III the account holder s account is fully enabled for use.

Refer now to where a tiered fraud detection system is illustrated as part of transaction processor . The first tier of the tiered system includes a rules based engine and user selected components . The second tier of the tiered system includes proprietary components that are not accessible or visible to the account holders.

User selected components include for example the ability of the account holder to customize security for their account. Account holders may link several the cell phone number for family members that are authorized to access the prepaid account. For each designated phone number the account holder may specify maximum spending limits on a daily weekly or monthly basis. The account holder may exclude certain merchants account numbers or telephone numbers by creating a personal black list for the designated excluded parties.

A specific black list implementation allows the account holder to designate wild card exclusions such as blocking transfer of funds to any phone having a particular area code or to any 900 or foreign number. The account holder may create a separate personal black list for an authorized user. This feature is particularly useful to control improper spending by cell phone equipped children. Any number of numbers or accounts may be included on the black list.

Conversely the account holder may also specify certain merchants or telephone numbers that may be included in a financial transaction that involves one of the authorized users. All other merchants and telephone numbers may be optionally deemed to be on the personal black list. Again this feature is particularly useful to control the spending of children by allowing purchases for transit lunch and school supplies but not for magazines or other novelties.

In addition to specifying the personal black list and white list the account holder can also preauthorize purchases at each of the merchants appearing on the white list while setting a per transaction limit on the other numbers on the white list.

The account holder may customize a rules based fraud detection mechanism which is also implemented at the first tier.

The account holder may also specify the maximum amount for each transaction and the number of transactions that may be processed on a cell phone in a selected period. The account holder may also specify the maximum amount of funds that are to be deposited and retained in the prepaid debit account. The transaction processor sweeps excess funds to another designated account such as a personal savings account on a daily basis.

The second tier of the tiered system includes proprietary components that are not accessible or visible to the account holders. For example the second tier includes a maximum spending limit based on historical averages geographical verification the historical number of daily transactions. Other rules based fraud detection and transaction frequency velocity control mechanisms are also implemented here as well.

A fraud and risk rules engine not shown controls risks by applying spending limits and determining the acceptability of requested transactions from a risk perspective. Such fraud detection systems are known and are often used to monitor for fraud when credit cards are used. The information collected for each financial transaction may be mined for use by merchant and consumer value added applications by business monitoring applications by system operations applications and security monitoring applications as well.

Refer now to which shows a pooled account embodiment to minimize ACH and credit card interchange fees. Rather than maintain a separate prepaid debit account for each account holder the present embodiment utilizes a pooled prepaid debit account . When transactions occur between account holders as indicated at money is retained in the pooled account but is moved from one account holder s account to the other account holder s account. The transfer is immediate and does not incur any transaction fees for the system operator. For this reason the account holder may be charged little or nothing for a transaction fee.

At times account holders may add funds to the pooled account as indicated at . Such funds may be deposited at a partner merchant that has agreed to accept funds from account holders which are then deposited into the pooled account. Alternatively the account holder may utilize their plastic debit card at an ATM to deposit cash or checks on the Internet by making an account transfer by telephone or automatically as specified on the user profile page associated with each account.

At other times account holders may transfer funds out of the pooled account as indicated at . The new account holder may withdraw such funds when they do not wish to retain a balance in their prepaid debit account.

In this embodiment the system operator is an account aggregator and becomes the system of record in terms of risk and risk control. The system operator is also responsible for performing the OFAC compliance check. The system operator may be a bank a financial institution or may subcontract the pooled account management to another bank.

In an embodiment near field communication is used to communicate between mobile devices to conclude financial transactions using the infrastructure of the present invention. In yet another embodiment near field communication is used to communicate from a mobile device to a POS terminal to conclude financial transactions.

Security and fraud prevention are important issues for the payments industry and are a continuing source of problems. The mobile payment transfer infrastructure and method of operation in accordance with the present invention are effective tools in addressing these problems. Specifically the use of the mobile device to conduct financial transactions allows for a real time transaction that uses funds that are guaranteed to be available. The receiving party may verify the validity of the entity holding the funds and that the account has a sufficient balance to conclude the transaction. Advantageously the account information credit card number debit card number or other account at a financial institution need not be provided to conclude the transaction.

On the sending side of the transaction the sending party uses a PIN code to identify the person with the phone. This authentication provides a high level of security because the payment server is able to identify the mobile device using caller ID and the person using the mobile device is identified by a PIN. Advantageously the transferred in a secured manner and is not stored in the mobile device in a visible form.

Additionally the transaction may be identified by a unique sequence number that is determined by the mobile client application and is sent as part of the command stream to the payment server. At the payment server a history of used sequence numbers is maintained so transactions with previously used sequence numbers will not be processed. After each transaction and before the next transaction the mobile device updates the sequence number with a new sequence number. For example the new sequence may be the old sequence number incremented by 1. In an alternative implementation the sequence numbers may be any number including a random number. Furthermore an algorithm may be used that creates a predicable sequence of numbers. This sequence of numbers may be generated using a seed created from a hash function on information such as the telephone number time of day or other. At the time of initialization the payment server is provided the initial sequence number and know the algorithm and see so it can predict what sequence number should next. If the sequence number is not correct then the server rejects the transaction. This can help prevent spoof attacks.

The sequence number helps prevent fraud and also avoids duplication of financial transactions which may be due to communications protocol where transaction information is sent multiple times. This is similar to the situation where a fax machine tries to send a fax again if it has not received a proper acknowledgement.

If SMS messages are used to complete a transaction the authorization PIN is preferably a verbal code that is spoken into the mobile device and transmitted to the payment server for authentication using voice recognition software.

Merchant transactions are preferably structured to use an active authorization where the account holder s phone rings with a message to approve the dollar amount transferred. Credit cards and checks can not operate with this level of interaction.

Additional security is provided by the use of the PIN code to activate the mobile client application. In this embodiment the PIN code occurs in a first instance to open the mobile client application and initiate its operation. The same PIN code or preferably a separate PIN code is used for authorization of transactions over the network. This dual PIN code process is not available on credit cards checks or even smart cards.

When fraud is detected the mobile device may be disabled and prevented from using the network to access the account. In general mobile devices have several key attributes that facilitate future security safeguards. Most if not all of these attributes do not exist on cards. Specifically the mobile devices include an independent source of power to run physical devices such as special purpose chips and a secure case or housing that may house devices like smart chips. Mobile devices allow communication by voice and by data over the cellular network or over the Internet so voice verification and a PIN may be used in combination or separately to identify an account holder. Transactions may be initiated and verified by use of voice recognition technology and by data entered through a keyboard. In other embodiments visual communication is provided through the use of a camera.

Another level of security is provided by the use of location technology such as a geo positioning system or GPS may determine the physical location of the device. Thus if the account holder is using the payment service in an atypical location such as when they are on vacation the account user may be authenticated by asking for the PIN to be re entered. Another advantage of the location technology is that the services made available to the account holder can be adjusted based on where they are located. For example discounts or special promotions may be sent along with the confirmation for a transaction whenever the location of the account holder matches that of the merchant. In other embodiments if the account holder is in the area of a merchant that is offering a special discount a promotional message could be sent to the account holder if authorized by their profile maintained by the payment server.

Upon receipt of a transaction request as indicated at the payment server receives a sequence number from the cell phone and compares it with the sequence number held by payment server. If the sequence numbers match as indicated at then the payment server authorizes the transaction to continue. The sequence numbers at both the cell phone and payment server are then updated to a new sequence number. This security mechanism is used to prevent spoofing attacks or cloned phones. The user is then requested to enter their PIN as indicated at . By coupling the use of the sequence number with the PIN and the cell phone number there is a three level security blanket that authenticates the user PIN the phone number detected by caller ID and linked to a specific account and the sequence number to validate the transaction prevents an intruder from attempting to capture a transaction and then resubmit duplicate requests for a transaction . The sequence number is also used to discriminate multiple attempts of the SMS system to deliver a transaction message from valid multiple transactions.

If the sequence numbers do not match the payment server declines the transaction request as indicated at and fraud prevention measures are activated as indicated at . By way of examples when the sequence numbers do not match the account may be frozen until a customer service representative can determine the cause of the mismatched sequence numbers. This may necessitate a phone call the account holder to see if they are still in possession of their phone and whether they had authorized the attempted transaction.

At a user i.e. an account holder initiates a financial transaction on a mobile telephony device e.g. a mobile phone . At the user transmits a PIN at the time the transaction is initiated Option A . Alternatively as indicated at the user does not transmit a PIN at time the transaction is initiated Option B .

At the payment server receives the request from the mobile device to start the financial transaction. The server checks the caller identification caller ID number transmitted by mobile device to see whether mobile device is an authorized user of the system at . If caller ID is not enabled on the phone disallow the transaction as indicated at . An error message may be shown to indicate the transaction was disallowed because caller ID not enabled. User can retry the request after enabling caller ID.

If option B was selected the server must then send a request to the mobile device requesting the user to transmit a PIN as indicated at . This PIN may be transmitted via a keypad of the mobile device or voice e.g. to an interactive voice response IVR unit of the server .

Once the Caller ID is validated the server then checks the PIN transmitted from mobile device against PIN recorded in system to verify that the PIN matches the expected phone number as indicated at . If and only if the PIN matches will the server allow the transaction to proceed. If the PIN does not match then the transaction is disallowed as indicated at .

The server then receives a transaction number also referred to as a sequence number for the financial transaction from the mobile device. The transaction number may be sent at the time the transaction is initiated or later as part of the information transfer between the mobile device and the server. The transaction number includes idemopotent keys that make it unique.

The server also checks the present transaction number from the mobile device against a listing of transaction numbers already previously used as indicated at . This listing is stored in a database associated with the server. If the present sequence number matches any of the previously used sequence numbers the user is not authenticated and the transaction will be disallowed as indicated at . This verification step is useful in preventing multiple copies of a message from being treated as a new and independent message. It also prevents hacker attacks where an hacker has intercepted a message and is attempting to resubmit an old transaction.

In some embodiment the server also checks the transaction number as received from the mobile device against an expected transaction number stored at the server as indicated at . If the sequence numbers do not match the user is not authenticated and the transaction will be disallowed as indicated at .

If the sequence number from the phone matches the sequence number stored on the server or is a number not previously used the user is authenticated and the financial transaction will be allowed to proceed. In some embodiments the server only performs the transaction number verification as indicated at . In other embodiments the server only performs the transaction number verification as indicated at . In other embodiments the server only performs the transaction number verification as indicated at and at . As long as the server determines that the sequence number from the phone has not been used before or is the expected sequence number or both the transaction will be allowed. The sequence number may also be used as a unique transaction identifier. Step connects to a step via a link .

The server also stores the previous sequence number is stored or otherwise indicated at the server as a sequence number that has been used as indicated at . These previously used sequence numbers may be stored in a database on the server. If the server maintains an expected sequence number the sequence number at the phone and server are incremented in preparation for the next transaction as indicated at . The server then proceeds with completing the financial transaction as indicated at .

The above validation method presents some authentication steps in a specific order. An implementation of the invention performs the steps in the given order. However in other implementations of the invention they may be other steps includes or some steps may be omitted or the order of the steps may be different from above. For example the caller ID PIN and transaction can order independent. Therefore in an embodiment the PIN may be checked before the caller ID. In another embodiment the transaction number may be checked before the PIN. Furthermore some steps above may be performed at the same time on different processors or processor cores in a parallel processing implementation.

In an implementation a system of the invention may omit one or more of the authentication techniques listed above. For example the caller ID may not be authenticated so then a two factor authentication approach will be used.

A traditional model for two factor authentication is based on 1 what you have and 2 what you know. A first factor is something a user has such as a mobile phone personal digital assistant smartphone or plastic card. A second factor is something the user knows such as a personal identification number PIN mother s maiden name street address social security number driver s license number or home phone number.

Whether a three factor or two factor authentication is used may depend on the communication channel used by the mobile device and server. For example when SMS or data services SMS is used caller ID is available and a three factor authentication may be used. However when HTTP or HTTPS is used caller ID is typically not available and a three factor authentication will not be used. There may be additional factors used to authenticate an account holder or user so the technique may have more then three factors. Further the third factor of authentication may be managed by client side and server side software components.

 4 At server check the caller identification caller ID transmitted by mobile device to see whether mobile device is an authorized user of the system. If caller ID is not enabled on the phone disallow the transaction. Show error message indicating transaction was disallowed because caller ID not enabled. User can retry the request after enabling caller ID.

 5 If option A once caller ID is validated proceed to step 6. If option B once caller ID is validated the server sends a request to the mobile device for the user to transmit a PIN. This PIN may be transmitted via a keypad of the mobile device or voice e.g. to an interactive voice response IVR unit of the server .

 6 Caller ID has validated so check PIN transmitted from mobile device against PIN recorded in system. If PIN matches go to step 7.

 7 Receive a transaction number or sequence number for the financial transaction from the mobile device. This transaction number may be sent at the time step 1 occurs or may be sent later in the information transfer between the mobile device and the server. Proceed to 8a option C or 8b option D below.

 8a Option C Check the sequence number from the mobile device against a sequence number stored at the server. If the sequence numbers do not match the user is not authenticated and the transaction will be disallowed.

 8b Option D Check the present sequence number from the mobile device against a listing or database of sequence number already previous used which is stored at the server. If the present sequence number matches any of the previously used sequence numbers the user is not authenticated and the transaction will be disallowed.

 9 If the sequence number from the phone matches the sequence number stored on the server for option C or is a number not previously used for option D the user is authenticated and the financial transaction will be allowed to proceed. For option D in other words as long as server determines that the sequence number from the phone has not been used before the transaction will be allowed.

 10a If option C the sequence number at the phone and server are incremented in preparation for the next transaction.

 10b If option D the sequence number at the phone is incremented to the next sequence number. The previous sequence number is stored or otherwise indicated at the server as a sequence number that has been used. These previously used sequence numbers may be stored in a database on the server.

 1 On initialization of service use an initial transaction number value stored at both the mobile device and server. The initial transaction number may be 1a or 1b .

 1a The initial transaction number may be an integer number such as 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or other numbers.

 1b The initial transaction number may be a random number such as generated by a pseudorandom number generator and a given seed. This seed may be a hash code based on a property or characteristic of the device. For example the seed may be based on the telephone number serial number of the device property or stored value in an integrated circuit of the device or real time clock value.

 2 When the user uses an application where transaction number authentication is used the transaction number value will be changed from the initial or previous transaction number value to the next in sequence. The sequence may be any series mathematical pseudorandom or other. The sequence may be finite infinite or repeating series. If a repeating series the number of transaction numbers in the series before it repeats may be based on a number of binary bits used to represent the transaction number.

 2a For example the sequence may be arithmetic or geometric. For an example of an arithmetic series a transaction number may be an incremented by 1 or any other value or decremented by 1 or any other value to obtain the next transaction number is sequence. If the transaction number is represented using eight binary bits the sequence will repeat every 256 numbers. If the transaction number is represented using sixteen binary bits the sequence will repeat every 65536 numbers. Therefore the more number of bits that are used the longer the sequence.

 2b The sequence may be pseudorandom generated by a pseudorandom number generator. The sequence of pseudorandom numbers will be based on the starting seed value. The pseudorandom number may be represented using a floating point number. The floating point number may be stored using a binary floating point representation.

 3 After each transaction the mobile device and server where the transaction number of the mobile device will be authenticated against both generate the next transaction number in sequence according to the same algorithm. If the mobile device uses an arithmetic series the server will use an arithmetic series. If the mobile device uses a pseudorandom number series the server will use a pseudorandom number series. The same seed used by the mobile device will be used by the server. Depending on the particular implementation this seed may be transmitted from the device to the server or vice versa or independently determined.

 4 The mobile device and server will each store respective transaction numbers. The transaction number on mobile device may be referred to as a mobile device transaction number. The transaction number on the server may be referred to as the server transaction number.

 5 When a transaction occurs the server will compare its stored transaction number against the one stored on the mobile device. If the transaction numbers match an authentication occurs and the transaction will be allowed to proceed. Otherwise the transaction will be disallowed.

 6 After a transaction is allowed the transaction numbers will be advanced to the next in sequence at both the mobile device and server.

These techniques of using a transaction number to authenticate the mobile device help prevent fraud duplicate transactions and other undesirable circumstances. There are many variations of the specific implementations of transaction number authentication and any of these variations may be used and in any combination with the above described approaches. For example instead of checking whether a transaction number from a mobile device matches a corresponding number at the server the authentication technique may check whether the transaction number a does not match a corresponding number at the server or b does not match a previously used number at the server as previously described in this application .

In a particular implementation the client sequence number authentication component keeps track of an encrypted counter which starts out at a random nonzero value which is set during client side installation. Upon each transaction the client SNA component increments the client counter value by a random nonzero value. The server sequence number authentication component keeps track of the last received counter values for clients based on client identifier. If the incoming client counter value is greater then the last received value then transaction is accepted. The counter value is stored and the transaction is acted upon. Otherwise if the counter value is not greater than the last received value the transaction is invalid and the account may be suspended. This implementation is merely one of there are many possible variations of sequence number authentication.

Examples of a rich client include an application or program running on a mobile phone smartphone portable computer or other electronic device. The application or part of an application may be written in a programming language such as J2ME BREW or .NET CF. The application may be a specific application for mobile payments. An example of such a program and accompanying user screens is described elsewhere in this application. Or the functionality may be part of another program such as an instant messenger program real time Internet chat program file transfer program music player program video player program file sharing program bill paying service interface program or bill splitting program.

For example when using an instant messenger program e.g. AOL Instant Messenger AIM ICQ Yahoo Messenger Microsoft Windows Live Messenger Google Talk or Skype there will be an option to send another user a payment. The option to send a payment may be accessible using a right click of a mouse or though a pull down or cascading menu. The recipient may be identified through user name member name phone number member number account number or another identifier. The payment will be processed through the mobile payment service server.

Examples of a thin client include a Web browser application phone or other device with SMS text messaging phone or other device with a WAP browser or terminal emulation program.

In a specific implementation of the invention when using a rich client a stored sequence number will be stored persistently in a counter in the rich client. This stored sequence number may follow any arbitrary sequence such as sequential integer or binary counter e.g. 1 2 3 4 and so forth a random sequence based on a known starting seed value or sequence according to an equation formula or rule. The stored sequence number may be stored for example in flash memory electrically erasable E 2 memory nonvolatile memory battery backed memory hard drive or other memory.

With each transaction an idempotence key called a sequence number in other implementations of the invention is sent to the mobile payment system. For a rich client the key will include a combination of member ID and the stored sequence number. This stored sequence number may be the next unused stored sequence number. When the mobile payment system receives the rich client s idempotence key the transaction is stored in a transaction table along with this idempotence key. In the transaction table each idempotence key will be expected to be unique. So if the mobile payment system receives another transaction with a previously received idempotence key the transaction may be disregarded since it is likely a duplicate transaction or a security problem.

In a specific implementation the user s account may be flagged with a potential security violation for person to investigate. If a user has a number of such violations or a number of such violations over a particular period of time then the account may be automatically suspended for pending investigation.

In a specific implementation of the invention when using a thin client the idempotence key will include member ID target ID transaction amount and time or time stamp . The mobile payment system will receive this idempotence key and handle similarly to the situation when receiving a rich client idempotence key.

Therefore a mobile payment system of the invention may work with different types of clients and each type of client may send different types of idempotence keys or sequence numbers. This embodiment has two different types of idempotence keys but in other embodiments there may be any number of idempotence or sequence number key types. For example there may be three four five six seven eight or more key types.

A technique is used to ensure the authenticity of a wireless transmission source which is requesting a transaction to be performed by a system. The transaction may be a person to person money transfer or other value exchange transaction. The wireless transmission source may be a mobile phone or other similar device. The wireless transmission source transmits a key with the transaction request. The system will determine the authenticity of the transmission based on the transmitted key. If the transmission is determined to be authentic the transaction will be acted upon. Various approaches for determining authenticity are discussed. The technique may also be used to prevent acting upon duplicate transmissions.

In an embodiment the invention is a method including receiving an electronic request for a value exchange transaction wirelessly transmitted from a user device receiving with the electronic request a transmitted key associated with the electronic request and determining whether the transmitted key exists in a transactions table. If the transmitted key is not in the transactions table the transmission will be considered authentic. Therefore the transmitted key and value exchange transaction are input into the transaction table and the value exchange transaction is processed by the system. If the transmitted key is in the transactions table the transmission is not considered authentic or may be a duplicate transmission . Therefore t the value exchange transaction is not acted on by the system. The user device may be a mobile phone.

In an implementation the transmitted key includes an electronic identifier identifying a user that requested the value exchange transaction and a sequence number. The sequence number is stored at the user device and advanced to a next number in sequence before a next value exchange transaction is transmitted by the user device. Then each valid transmission should have a different or unique sequence number.

The sequence number may be stored in a nonvolatile or otherwise persistent memory at the user device such as flash electrically erasable E 2 memory magnetic storage or battery backed memory. This will ensure each transmission will have a unique value.

The transmitted key may include a pseudorandom number such as generated using a pseudorandom number generator using a particular seed value. The seed value will change each time a new pseudorandom number is generated so a sequence of pseudorandom numbers will be generated.

In an implementation the transmitted key includes a first electronic identifier identifying a user that requested the value exchange transaction a second electronic identifier identifying a user that is a target of the value exchange transaction a value amount of the value exchange transaction and a time associated with the value exchange transaction.

In an implementation the value exchange transaction may be sending money from a first user associated with the user device to a second user associated with another user device. For example the first user may request payment of a certain amount of money from the first user s account to the second user.

The transmitted key is not displayed on the user device so it will not be known to the user. This may be useful to prevent people who try to clone another user s account and using money in another user s account. If the transmitted key is displayed another user may be able to more easily determine the next number in sequence the function or equation being used to generate the keys or other information that may help reverse engineering of the key. In a further implementation the transmitted key is encrypted to make it for difficult to intercept the wireless transmission of the key.

The electronic request may be made via SMS text messaging service of the user device. The key may also be transmitted using the SMS text messaging service

When using different types of clients or programs the transmitted key may be generated or obtained differently such as by different functions. For example the key may include different information. The key may include first information when the user device sends the electronic request using a first application client and the transmitted key comprises first information when the user device sends the electronic request using a first application client which is different from the first application client. Examples of first information may be a key including a sequence number that is persistently stored. Examples of second information may be a key including a time or time stamp.

A first application client may be a rich client such as a dedicated value exchange transaction service application executing on the user device e.g. written in J2ME BREW or .NET CF or instant messenger application. A second application client may be thin client such as an SMS messaging application on the user device WAP browser on the user device or Web browser on the user device. When sending the request from the rich client there may be persistent stored value such as stored counter and this is used in the key. However when sending the request from a thin client there may not be a persistent stored value and a time or timestamp may be used in the key instead. The system will be able to handle receiving different keys or different key types.

If the transmitted key is in the transactions table this means the transmission was possibly sent previously or someone is trying to break into the system. The account of the user may be suspended and the matter investigated further. This will prevent further illegal transactions on the user s account.

Further processing the value exchange transaction may include generating a transaction identifier number for the value exchange transaction. This transaction identifier number will be generated by the system processing the request. An electronic message may be sent to the user device including the transaction identifier number. The transaction identifier number may be viewable on the user device. This allows the user to have a reference number for the transaction so the user may discuss or inquire about the transaction directly with a customer service representation. This transaction identifier may be completely unrelated to the authentication key which is generated at the user device . The transaction identifier may be generated by a banking partner handling the transaction. In an alternative implementation the key may be used in generating or creating the transaction identifier.

In an embodiment the invention is a method including receiving an electronic request for a value exchange transaction wirelessly transmitted from a user device receiving a transmitted key associated with the electronic request generating an expected key comparing the transmitted key to the expected key and if the transmitted key matches the expected key processing the value exchange transaction. The value exchange transaction may be sending money from a first user associated with the user device to a second user associated with another user device where the user devices a mobile phones.

Generating the expected key may include evaluating a function or equation using a seed value stored for a user account associated with the value exchange transaction. Further the user account may also store information about the particular function or equation to use to generate the expected key. For example some users may use one particular function to generate a key while other users use other functions. Different starting seeds are used for different users and after each use a new seed will be created for generating of the next key. In other words the method further includes after evaluating the function determining a next seed value in sequence and replacing the seed value stored for the user account with the next seed value in sequence.

For example the user device has a counter that counts in a particular sequence and generates keys in this sequence using a particular function e.g. pseudorandom number generator . On the server or system side the server will know the expected key because it is stored in the user s profile and will also know the function to use to generate the key. If the expected key matches the transmitted key then the user s request is authenticated. As stated above the function or equation used may vary or change per user or device or even per use. The identification of which function or equation to use to generate the expected key will be stored someone in the system such as in a user s profile.

In particular the invention may include retrieving from a user profile associated with the value exchange transaction a seed value retrieving from the user profile information on a function according to which the transmitted key was generated and evaluating the function using the seed value. As discussed above a method of the invention may or may not include different function. In such as case function information would not need to be stored in the profile.

If the transmitted key does not match the expected key the value exchange transaction will not be acted upon. A user account associated with the value exchange transaction may be suspended to prevent further transfers of money since a security violation has occurred. The account may be flagged e.g. display on a screen sending an e mail sending an instant message to a system administrator who can investigate further. Or an automated e mail may be sent the user to contact customer service because a security violation has occurred for the user s account.

Processing the value exchange transaction may include generating a transaction identifier number different from the expected key for the value exchange transaction and sending an electronic message to the user device including the transaction identifier number where the transaction identifier number is displayed on the user device.

In one embodiment the MCA is based on the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition J2EE and boasts a simple intuitive interface. As a result account holders enter their request data such as amount phone number or other account identity information such as an e mail address or instant messenger ID of the receiving account and PIN. Designed to be flexible and easy to configure the MCA has different versions for different languages and is designed to run under Java 2 Mobile Edition J2ME dot Net .NET as well as WAP BREW Symbian and SIM Toolkit or other mobile protocols and may be ported to platforms such as cell devices PDAs or other mobile electronic devices. Java .Net Brew Symbian and Sim Toolkit are believed to be trademarks of their respective owners. MCA is also available for phone operating system including Nokia Motorola Samsung Sanyo and other common brands. Advantageously no special semiconductor device or chip on the mobile device is required to perform secure cost effective and mobile financial transactions.

To initiate operation account holders install or have installed the MCA on their mobile phone. Application provisioning can be conducted in the following ways 

 1 Over the Air Provisioning using a WAP push the payment server sends a message to the account holder to start the application download. Alternatively the account holder can use a WAP pull to send a message to the payment server to initiate the process 

 2 Proximity Provisioning at customer service centers partner merchant locations or mobile service providers may install the MCA via Bluetooth infrared or other near field wireless connection 

 3 Internet Downloading where account holders may download the program over the Internet and install it through a USB port or even download the program from one phone to another or

 4 On a SIM card where account holders may purchase devices with the MCA already installed on the SIM card.

In an example scenario a user has a mobile device equipped with near field communication capability. The user may see a product or item he wants to purchase. The use puts the user s mobile device in proximity with a near field communication device associated with the product or item. Then the display of the mobile device inquires whether the user will approve a transaction to purchase the product or item. If the user approves the transaction is processed. The user will receive the item such as picking up from a delivery point or the item may be delivered to the user s mailing address. The user may be prompted for a PIN or challenge question to verify that they have approved the transaction.

An aspect of the invention is a mobile payment system or service. This application discusses many specific embodiments and implementations of individual components and elements variations and modifications of these and combinations of these. A system of the invention may include any of the variations or specific implementations discussed singly or in any combination. In this application an example of a specific implementation of a mobile payment system is provided and this specific implementation is the Obopay system. The Obopay system is merely one implementation of a mobile payment system and is discussed to describe more easily various aspects of the invention. The invention encompasses many mobile payment system implementations and is not limited to the specific implementations described.

The mobile client application allows people to pay friends shop and transfer funds by their mobile device. An account holder can access the mobile client application to send money or request money from anyone with a mobile device that supports text messaging or mobile Internet capabilities. They can also see the balance and history of their account in real time.

The mobile client application supports the following features Pay Balance History Request Pay Refer or Invite Add Money i.e. Load Settings Help. MCA can be used to send money from an account holder s account to any mobile subscriber whose device supports text messaging. The account holder sending the money needs to be an account holder however the person or merchant to whom they are sending the money does not.

The financial transaction may be initiated by either the payer or the payee. If the payer initiates the transaction the MCA is used to initiate the transaction. To use MCA to send money from a prepaid debit account the account holder will go through a sequence of steps 

 1 Open MCA on the account holder s mobile device. This will take the account holder to a splash screen which displays a logo and tag line. The account holder then presses enter to continue. This will bring the account holder to the main menu screen which displays a menu of the features of MCA including Pay Balance History Request Pay Refer or Invite Add Money i.e. Load Settings and Help.

 2 The account holder then selects the Pay option to send a payment. This will take the account holder to the Pay screen where the account holder will enter the telephone number to which they want to send their payment.

 3 To select a phone number in the account holder s phone book the account holder will select options from the lower left soft key on the mobile device and then find from the options menu which will bring up the account holder s existing phone address book and allow them to select a name in it. Optionally the account holder may enter the phone number directly from the keypad. In another embodiment the account holder enters a short code to identify a desired merchant payee. Once the account holder has entered the mobile number they will select OK.

 4 This will bring them to the amount screen where the account holder will enter the amount that they want to pay. Depending on the payee s profile at tip screen may appear that offers the account holder the opportunity to add a gratuity to the amount they want to pay.

 5 When the account holder selects OK they will be brought to the message screen where they can add a message to their transaction. This message may be a text audio or video attachment. If the account holder does not want to add a message they can simply click OK before writing a message and no message will be added to their transaction. If the transmission network has limited bandwidth the account holder may be restricted in the type and duration of the message. If the receiving party to the transaction does not have a mobile device capable of handling video or audio messages the message may be stored on the server for a short period to allow subsequent retrieval via the Internet.

 6 Once the account holder selects OK they will be brought to the PIN screen where they will enter their PIN and select OK. When entering the PIN the alphanumeric characters do not appear on the screen but rather a pseudo character is displayed instead. Also the PIN cannot be found in a message log or other logs on the mobile device. If another person were to have access to the mobile device they would not be able to determine the PIN.

This will bring the account holder to the confirmation screen which will show them the following information 

If the target payee does not have an existing account then a message such as Note The recipient you paid is not a registered account holder. The recipient has been sent a message with instructions on how to receive the payment.

If the target payee is an existing account holder the payee will receive a message that they have a new item added to their account. When they open the item they will see a transaction receipt with the following information 

If the target payee does not yet have an existing account the payee will receive a text message that says you ve got cash and that instructs them to go to a web site such as www.obopay.com to become an account holder and receive their cash. The process for new account holder registration is detailed later in this document.

If the financial transaction is initiated by the payee the MCA is used to initiate the transaction by requesting payment from the payer. An example of a payee initiated transaction is where a pizza delivery service dials the number of the person who ordered the pizza just prior to when the pizza is delivered. When the mobile device is answered the account holder is given the opportunity to make the payment via the mobile payment infrastructure of the present invention.

To use MCA to request money from an account the account holder goes through a similar sequence of steps 

 1 Open MCA on the account holder s mobile device. This will take the account holder to a splash screen which displays a logo and tag line. The account holder then presses enter to continue. This will bring the account holder to the main menu screen which displays a menu of the features of MCA including Pay Balance History Request Pay Refer or Invite Add Money Settings and Help.

 2 The account holder then selects the Request option to request a payment and will enter the telephone number to which they want to send their request.

 3 To select a phone number in the account holder s phone book the account holder will select options from the lower left soft key on the mobile device and then find from the options menu which will bring up the account holder s existing phone address book and allow them to select a name in it. This address book may correspond by way of illustration to a list of telephone numbers for account holders who have requested a pizza delivery. As part of the request the delivery person may append a tip screen that offers the account holder the opportunity to add a gratuity to the amount they want to pay.

 4 When the payee selects OK they will be brought to the message screen where they can add a message to their transaction. In one embodiment this message can be a text audio or video attachment. If the payee does not want to add a message they can simply click OK before writing a message and no message will be added to their transaction.

 5 Once the account holder selects OK they will be brought to the PIN screen where they will enter their PIN optionally entering a tip and selecting OK. The request will be sent to the payer who has the option to approve the transaction by entering their PIN and pressing OK. As noted above the PIN is maintained in a confidential and safe so unauthorized people cannot determine the PIN merely by gaining unauthorized access to the mobile device.

The payment will be initially processed and the payee will receive notification of the payment. If there are no problems with the transaction the account holder will not receive any further notifications. If any problems do arise with the payment i.e. insufficient funds both the account holder and the target payee will be notified. Notification regarding any problems with the payment will promptly occur after the payment is sent so that the parties can confirm the transaction.

The MCA can also be used to by an Account holder to check the current balance of their prepaid debit account from their mobile device. To use MCA to check their balance the account holder will go through the following steps 

 2 This will take the account holder to the splash screen which displays the logo and tag line. The account holder will press enter to continue.

This will bring the account holder to the main menu screen which displays a menu of the features of MCA including Pay Balance History Request Pay Settings and Help. The account holder will select Balance to check their balance.

This will bring the account holder to the balance screen which will provide them with the following information 

The MCA can be used to by an account holder to view the history of their last n where n is an integer number such as 3 or 5 by way of example transactions and the current balance of their prepaid debit account from their mobile device. To use MCA to check their history the account holder will go through the following steps 

 1 Open MCA on the account holder s mobile device. This will take the account holder to the splash screen which displays the logo and tag line. The account holder then presses enter to continue.

 2 This will bring the account holder to the main menu screen which displays a menu of the features of MCA including Pay Balance History Request Pay Settings and Help. The account holder will select History to view their history.

 3 This will bring the account holder to the PIN screen where they will enter their PIN and select OK.

 4 This will bring the account holder the history screen which will provide them with the following information 

The account holder will be able to select any one of the transactions listed to get more information on that specific transaction. To do this they scroll over the specific transaction that they want to view and select it. This will bring them to a screen with the following information 

The account holder then selects OK to go back to the history screen. From here they can view another transaction or go back to the main menu screen.

Further the account holder may link their account with accounting application software such that each transaction is recorded in a database for use in budgeting planning record keeping or for tax purposes. In this embodiment the account holder can add a second message that designates the payment whether sent or received according to the nature of the financial transaction. For example when the account holder buys a meal while on a business trip the second message may indicate that the transaction is a tax deductible reimbursable expense. The charge is recorded by the accounting application software. The accounting application software may be provided by the server platform See or by a software provider partner. The accounting application software may be a value added option where the account holder may pay a monthly charge to access.

As noted above the MCA can be used to request money by an account holder from any other account holder s account. Both the account holder requesting the money and the account holder that they are requesting money from should be account holders. In another implementation of the invention the service allows request pay transaction to nonservice members i.e. viral request pay . To use MCA to request a payment from an account holder the requesting account holder will go through the following steps. Open MCA on the requesting account holder s mobile device. This will take the account holder to the splash screen which displays the logo and tag line. The account holder presses enter to continue.

Advantageously the MCA enables account holders to create an off line profile that can be configured to auto respond when their mobile device is turned off or out of range. For example the account holder could configure their account to auto accept money deposits or auto accept withdrawals from specified account holders. If the account holder s mobile device is turned on any offline transactions could be retrieved by calling into the payment server for a balance inquiry or a history request. In other alternatives the account holder could specify that account information be delivered by SMS or voice mail.

The MCA and Platform wire protocol is used in conjunction with MCAP codec to serialize deserialize data for communication between various devices running MCAs and the data center hosting J2EE based services. MCA and Platform wire protocol specifies the format of serialized data passed between devices and data center. MCAP codec is the component on mobile devices and the data center handles serialization and deserialization according to MCA and platform wire protocol specifications. shows a straightforward illustration of the basic concepts.

A service request is initiated by the mobile device is the PaymentService.payP2P call. This function performs account holder to account holder payment the java method signature is 

Everything other than a return value is explained in the diagram. On the response the return value is included in addition to the overhead the return value string starts with an object type code 9 in this case translate to CommonPaymentSummary non null attributes of the return value follows for example attribute 1 paymentAmount has a value of 1.27 etc.

Refer now to which is an example that shows a successful invocation of the service call by invoking the PaymentService. retrieveBalance call. This call retrieves the account balance for an account.

The request part is no different from the previous example but the response now represents an exception being thrown as a result of the service call. Object type 6 represents a return value of type EWPBusinessException its attributes are explained in .

Another service request from the mobile device and sample wire representations is the PaymentService.retrieveHistory call. As the name indicates this function retrieves the transaction history of an account.

Another device initiated service request is the requestPay function that is used to request a payment from another member.

The payRequestPay function is used in response to the requestPay call this call approves the payment requested.

Another function is the RegistrationService.whoAmI function that establishes service with the data center and is called when the application is invoked for the first time.

Another category of requests are those sent by the server the characteristics of these requests are that 1 they are currently only sent by SMS 2 they are usually notifications of events from the server to the devices 3 there are no synchronous responses for such requests.

To be consistent with MCA and platform architecture that handles device initiated calls the present invention has implemented the handler of such notifications on the device as device services with the same ServiceProxy signatures when methods on these device services are invoked from the server side. The codec and wire protocol are exactly the same as those requests initiated by the device. Here s a list of currently available device services and their methods 

notifyRequestPayReceived notifies target of the request pay operation of receipt of request pay payment.

Other device services may be readily defined and added to the MCA and are deemed to be based on the engineering considerations of a particular embodiment.

The high level design of MCA Platform MCAP as well as the user interface UI storyboards is now discussed and presents a complete set of mobile features that are expected and required by MCAP. The MCAP is basically a mobile wallet or pay by phone consumer mobile merchant application. The user interface of the MCAP is simple in that it only requires step by step entering of request data such as amount PIN etc. and then displaying of response data. By way of illustration and comparison the user interface of the MCAP does not require the graphical complexities of a mobile game application.

Preferably the MCAP is written in a language that is easily ported to run on as many mobile devices as possible. However the MCAP infrastructure expects certain functionality to be present on the mobile device. For example the ability to display entry fields and capture account holder inputs is required. The ability to utilize the data services of the mobile device via programmatic HTTPS API invocations is also required if the ability to utilize the SMS text services of the mobile device via programmatic SMS API invocations is not available.

The ability to utilize the persistent data services of the mobile device via programmatic API invocations. For example the ability to store data persistently on the SIM card or other nontransient memory is an optional functionality. Similarly the ability to intercept inbound messages to the mobile device and awaken the MCAP for processing is also optional. This functionality provides for example the ability to intercept an inbound SMS message on a specific port and handle it by the MCAP. The ability to programmatically integrate with the address book of the mobile device such that a specific entry field can be linked to the address book is also optional. The ability to programmatically notify the mobile device account holder of notable events via sound vibration or light is optional.

Preferably MCAP is modularized such that it is easily implemented on J2ME and proven on .NET as well as J2ME BREW Symbian and .NET CF Previously Windows Mobile 

The user can change settings such as the font size e.g. small medium or large . A protocol for communicating with the system may be selected such as HTTPS HTTP or SMS. The user may request that there is a sound or light or both notification when receiving a payment. There is a tip toggle so the user can have a tip screen show or not show on the target or recipient s phone for a request pay. Then the recipient may send more money than the user requested in the request pay.

There is a contacts menu where a user can save and choose contacts to pay or request pay from. There is a message or memo field where a user can enter a message along with the send payment or request payment request. For example the user may tell the target money 4 lunch. There is a screen where the user can input the user s pin. The pin will not be displayed but instead asterisks blanks or another character will be displayed instead. There may be a screen to list the entire transaction and gives the user an opportunity to confirm the transaction before sending. If there is an error the sure may select to edit the transaction before sending.

The application may further include a help or brief user s guide to assist the user and answer the user s question regarding use of the system.

Many small businesses use a commercial accounting service to handle accounts receivable and their general ledger. The present invention preferably links to the accounting service to provide one value added service that eliminates a data entry step and keeps a timely record of all transactions. When a financial transaction is completed the payment platform posts the payment automatically to the accounts receivable system. A message voice annotation or other means of designating the type of financial transaction is also sent to the accounting service.

The embodiments of the present inventions discussed relate to a real time on line system where the account holder s balance is maintained on the payment server. However there are instances where an off line payment option is desirable. Accordingly in one embodiment of the present invention the balance in the account holder s account is stored on a chip attached or associated with the mobile device. The chip which is often referred to as a smart chip is updated as transactions occur. An example of such a smart chip is a smart card chip manufactured by Sony Corporation and known as the FeliCa chip. A batch transmission at the end of the day occurs between each merchant and the payment system provider to effect settlement.

The off line payment option is illustrated in in conjunction with the real time on line architecture of an embodiment of the present invention that is shown in . With reference first to the MCA resident on mobile device interfaces with a chip associated with mobile device that functions as the off line manager . Both MCA and off line manager have access to a shared memory . In one embodiment off line manager also has an internal memory where it stores each transaction before it updates shared memory . Off line manager is controlled by MCA in terms of setting an initial account balance available for off line transactions as well as clearing stale transactions from off line manager after device resynchronizes accounts. Re synching is performed by MCA using communications platform either at a set time each day or when a next to occur on line transaction is initiated by the account holder.

Refer now to when the off line manager is activated and detects a merchant s POS terminal a transaction may occur in the off line mode. In this mode the off line manger is responsible for interfacing with the POS terminal to deduct the amount of the transaction. When manager detects a pay request it sends a message to MCA to request authorization or alternatively waits for authorization from the user. Such authorization may be a selected key or combination of keys being pressed in response to the authorization request. As indicated by reference arrow the payment is sent to POS . In response POS accepts the payment and sends a receipt as indicated by reference arrow . Manager maintains a running balance of the amount available for off line purchases as indicated at .

At a later time mobile device must resynchronize with the payment server a process that is illustrated in . Since off line manager maintains account holder s balance available for off line purchases it periodically sends an off line spending report and the ending balance to the payment server as indicated by reference arrow . Typically the re synching occurs at either the end or the beginning of each day. During re synching the off line manager transmits to server the summary of transactions which includes the amount of the transaction along with a date stamp and the merchant s identification number as indicated by reference arrow . Server acknowledges the transaction and re sets the available off line transaction amount to a post synch value as indicated by reference arrow . It is to be understood that the value stored for use by the off line manager may be user selected. Thus each day week or month the account holder could start with a preselected amount of funds available for off line transactions. To confirm balances server also synchronizes accounts with each merchant as indicated by reference arrow .

The advantages of this off line embodiment compared to sending offline money via a mobile phone equipped only with a smart chip include 

 1 Loss of the mobile device does not mean loss of the money because with the on line synchronization accounts can be closed and balances can be transferred to a new account and

The primary advantage of the offline transaction is very low transaction time to conclude a transaction. Off line transactions are a benefit to the account holder where a network authorized transaction may be too slow. However the combination of the real time network authorized model of the present invention when combined with off line payment capabilities provide a versatile adaptive and useful system.

As described above the present invention relates to a mobile payment platform and service that provides a fast secure and easy method for making payments by individuals using a mobile device. Funds are accessed from account holder s mobile device which may be a cell phone PDA or other packet oriented communication device to make and receive payments. Financial transactions are conducted on a person to person P2P basis where each party is identified by a unique indicator such as a telephone number or bar code. A Mobile Client Application MCA resident on the mobile device simplifies access and performing financial transactions in a fast secure manner.

In an embodiment this invention is related to mobile communications devices for consumers and more particularly to the ways of increasing the functionality of cellular telephones and other mobile consumer communications devices with removable identification modules.

Most mobile consumer communications devices e.g. cellular telephones PDAs Personal Digital Assistants laptop computers and the like contain a removable identification module IM card or chip which uniquely identifies a specific consumer s account to a wireless communications network carrier. The IM card chip stores data and provides some of the brains which allows the host mobile consumer communications device to function e.g. to make and receive voice calls to send or receive messages to run computer applications and so forth. This allows a user for instance to easily change cellular telephones by removing his or her IM card chip from one telephone and reinserting the card chip into another telephone. The need to activate the second cellular telephone by the communications network is eliminated.

Different types of mobile consumer communications devices use different types of IM cards chips. For example a SIM Subscriber Identity Module card works with GSM Global System for Mobile communications devices. Another type of IM card chip is a USIM Universal Subscriber Identity Module which operates with the UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System devices and still another is the RUIM Removable User Identity Module for CDMA Code Division Multiple Access devices. For purposes of this patent application any IM card chip is termed simply an IM or identification module.

But regardless of the type the IMs and their host mobile communications devices are generally closed systems proprietary to the wireless communications network carriers e.g. Cingular T Mobile Verizon and so forth the manufacturer of the mobile consumer communications device and the IM manufacturers e.g. Gemplus Oerthur and so forth . Nonetheless the communications protocols and the interface between the IM host communications devices i.e. the mobile consumer communications device and the IMs are open by the engineering standards set by the ISO International Standards Organization .

The present invention takes advantage of these open standards to create additional functionalities for the host mobile consumer communications device without interfering with the IM operations. The mobile consumer communications device still operates with the IM but additional functionality is inserted into the device. The present invention allows the restrictions of the mobile carriers handset manufacturers and IM manufacturers to be bypassed so that mobile program applications can run in the mobile consumer communications device for enhanced functionality of the device.

The IM adaptor can fit into the IM socket of the mobile consumer communications device as illustrated in . The IM adaptor fits into the IM socket of the cellular telephone which has its back cover not shown removed. As shown the IM adaptor fits into the IM socket and connects the IM through the ribbon cable and the programmable processing unit . Since the cable is flexible the housing can be flipped over into the cellular telephone as shown in . In practice a battery not shown for the cellular telephone may be installed over the IM socket and IM adaptor and then the housing flipped over the battery before the cover can be replaced as shown in .

The programmable processing unit can be implemented in a microcontroller an ASIC Application Specific Integrated Circuit a so called SOC System On a Chip and other integrated circuits. Each of these types of integrated circuits has one or more processor units and memory of varying capacity and offers differing degrees of customization capability and costs for the particular requirements of the program applications. The memory of the programmable processing unit holds the program applications for enhanced functionalities and the processor units execute the program applications. The program applications are uploaded through the wireless communications network.

In any case the programmable processing unit operates with an operating system event interface call outs post IM processing call outs an application registry and a programmatic language and runtime as illustrated in . The operating system facilitates the pass through communications between the host mobile consumer communications device and the IM as explained previously. The operating system also provides programmatic call outs to the program applications which are registered and installed in the programmable processing unit .

The event interface call outs provide a programmatic event interface which a program application implements in order to gain programmatic control of the host mobile consumer communications device upon specific mobile device events e.g. a press of a button a ring signal and so forth. During this control the program application has the ability to add functionality and processing to the event.

The post IM processing call outs provide a programmatic event interface which a program application implements in order to gain programmatic control of the host mobile consumer communications device upon a return from the native IM processing of the mobile consumer communications device event. The IM is always included last in the processing chain of an event. During this control the program application has the ability to add functionality and post processing to the event before the mobile consumer communications device regains control.

The application registry provides a configuration so that program applications can be registered as interested in specific events and therefore be programmatically called when those events occur . Several program applications may be registered for the same event and are called in a chain.

The programmatic language and runtime provides a programmatic language and platforms upon which the applications are created. Several suitable languages runtimes which are standard include BREW Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless developed by Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego Calif. to provide a standard set of application programming interfaces for developers to easily add new features and applications to Qualcomm based wireless hardware i.e. handsets equipped with CDMA chipsets J2ME Java 2 Mobile Edition a Java based technology for mobile systems from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Santa Clara Calif. .NET from Microsoft Inc. of Redmond Wash. to provide a software development platform for the Windows operating system and uses XML eXtended Markup Language and Symbian a platform designed for mobile devices by a joint venture of many companies including L.M. Ericsson of Stockholm Sweden and Nokia Corp. of Espoo Finland. Of course the preceding language platforms represent only examples and other languages could be used.

Some examples of program applications which may be run in the programmable processing unit are described in this application. For example below the application describes a way of sending data over the voice channel rather the data channel of the wireless communications network of a mobile consumer communications device. In one program application the mobile consumer communications device can send text messages to another mobile consumer communications device over its voice channel. In another patent application mobile payments may be performed by the mobile consumer communications device over its voice channel.

Thus far the mobile consumer communications device such as the cellular telephone of has been described as requiring only an IM which fits into the device s IM socket to engage a wireless communications network. On the other hand laptop computers typically do not have a built in IM socket. Laptop computers use a USB adaptor which accepts the user s IM and the USB adaptor is connected to a USB connector which fits into the laptop computer s USB port. shows how the previously described IM adaptor fits into the USB adaptor to place the IM in contact with the host laptop computer. With the IM in contact with the laptop computer to engage the wireless communications network the programmable processing unit allows additional functionality through program applications.

Mobile consumer communications devices such as cellular telephones ordinarily use a voice channel to transmit and receive voices. The present invention provides a way for program applications to communicate their data over the voice channel of mobile consumer communications devices.

The present invention permits applications which may be created on any number of programming platforms runtimes for mobile applications to be networked by the voice channel of the host mobile consumer communications device. Example platforms include BREW Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless developed by Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego Calif. to provide a standard set of application programming interfaces for developers to easily add new features and applications to Qualcomm based wireless hardware i.e. handsets equipped with CDMA chipsets J2ME Java 2 Mobile Edition a Java based technology for mobile systems from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Santa Clara Calif. .NET from Microsoft Inc. of Redmond Wash. to provide a software development platform for the Windows operating system and uses XML eXtended Markup Language Symbian a platform designed for mobile devices from a joint venture of many companies including L.M. Ericsson of Stockholm Sweden and Nokia Corp. of Espoo Finland. Of course other programming platforms runtimes may be used.

With DTMF tones being received the server across the wireless communications network engages IVR Interactive Voice Response unit to decode the tones. IVR can send and receive DTMF tones sometimes called touch tones and is found in many current automatic telephone answering systems. It allows a computer to automatically interact with a human using Voice Recognition Audio Playback Text To Speech TTS and DTMF technologies. An IVR Plug in is an IVR adapted API to place the data into a proper form for an application in the server . This allows the application hosted in the mobile consumer communications device to communicate with the enterprise application hosted in the server over the voice channel . Data signals travel in both directions between the two applications and . Communications simply between the mobile consumer communications device and the server are examples of client server communications over the voice channel. On the other hand the operation of the server application might be to simply relay the data from the mobile consumer communications device to another mobile consumer communications device. This is an example of peer communications over the voice channel.

The API in an embodiment of the present invention e.g. the APIs and of is based upon a simple sendRequest processRequest model with well known request response data structures on both the client and server sides. The APIs and are a paired set of client and server APIs which mobile application and enterprise server developers use to build a complete client server application. Voice data processing software i.e. library components on both the client mobile consumer communications device and server sides implement voice data processing algorithms for data communication across the voice channel. These algorithms are of course distinct from the particular client server applications and .

This is the single API interface that a mobile client application uses in order to send a request data to an enterprise server application.

This is the single API interface that the enterprise server application implements in order to process a calling mobile client s request. The processing logic is completely the responsibility of the host enterprise application and it is also the responsibility of the host enterprise application to assemble the response data that will be returned to the calling mobile client.

CommandID A numeric value which uniquely represents a command and associated parameter data that is understood by both the host client and server applications.

ServerAddress A numeric value which represents a phone number that will be used in order to dial a voice call which will reach the server IVR component which front ends the target enterprise service.

ResponseID A numeric value which uniquely represents a response and associated parameter data that is understood by both the host client and server applications.

ParameterID A numeric value which uniquely represents a parameter within a given CommandID and is understood by both the host client and server applications.

As mentioned above an API can use different encoding decoding algorithms according to the present invention. The following is one example for encoding with DTMF. These rules of DTMF encoding are based on commonly accepted rules of entering numbers and letters using the keypad labeling found on telephones 

The encoding example above shows numeric and upper case alphabetic characters specifically. However encoding for lower case and special characters can be made as well.

Hence the elements of the API described above provide a protocol by which data from program applications can communicate over the voice channel of mobile consumer communications devices.

One example of an application is simple text messaging through the voice channel rather than through a data channel as done conventionally. The application hosted by the mobile consumer communications device of for instance sends alphanumeric signals with an identification of the recipient e.g. a telephone number across the voice channel . The enterprise application in the server simply relays the alphanumeric signals to the designated recipient across another voice channel. Of course it is assumed that the recipient also has the described capabilities of receiving and sending data across a voice channel.

A more complex example of a networked application which more fully utilizes the particular API features described above is a mobile payment functionality for mobile consumers. All required client server data communications are performed via a voice channel phone call. In this application example the mobile consumers are assumed to have mobile consumer communications devices which are capable of running a mobile payment application and the consumer s mobile service plan allows voice calls only. A source consumer wants to send money from his or her mobile account to a friend s target consumer mobile account. Both the source and target consumers are signed up for the service that the enterprise server application provides. The enterprise server application provides a web service API which transfers funds from a source account to a target account.

The commands in this example are payRequest represented by CommandID 1 and payResponse represented as CommandID 2. The parameter data structures are defined in the two tables below 

Now for the source consumer to pay a target consumer the following operations and interactions occur 

The host mobile client application interacts with the source consumer and gathers the following data 

The host mobile client application knows the following data as a result of context and configuration 

The mobile application then calls the SendRequest API using the above Request structure data. Control now passes to the client API.

The client API now performs the encode algorithm and converts the Request structure into the following text string 

When the final is received the server IVR plugin component begins decoding the encoded DTMF request data. To do this the IVR plugin uses the inverse of the encoding rules presented above.

The IVR plugin has now assembled an exact duplicate of the client s Request structure only now on the server side memory space.

The IVR plugin now invokes the enterprise server application via the ProcessRequest interface which the enterprise server application has implement.

The enterprise server application then assembles an Response structure just as the mobile client application assembled the Request structure.

The IVR plugin then encodes the Response structure as described above i.e. in this case with the status and transactionNumber data elements .

The mobile client application API decodes the encoded DTMF response data into a client side Response structure using the decoding rules described above i.e. in this case into an Response structure .

The host client mobile application regains control has access to the server Response structure and continues processing.

Hence the present invention provides for program applications to communicate over the voice channel of mobile consumer communications devices. As mentioned earlier encoding different from DTMF might be selected to speed the transmission of data across the voice channel. Such encoding might depend upon the particular application on the host mobile consumer communications device and corresponding enterprise server. Mobile consumer communications devices could be adapted to communicate program application data across the voice channel rather than the data channel of the wireless communications network.
