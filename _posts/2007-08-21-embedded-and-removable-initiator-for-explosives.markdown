The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties therefor.

The present invention relates generally to explosive warheads and more particularly to methods and apparatus for embedding an initiator within a main explosive charge and the warheads formed thereby.

As illustrated in it is known to provide a warhead including a fixed initiator . More particularly the initiator usually includes an initiator charge coupled to a safe arm device not shown through a precision initiating coupling PIC . The initiator charge is typically in a fixed position by being rigidly coupled to the warhead case . As is known the initiator charge is configured to bridge a gap and detonate a main explosive charge . The gap between the initiator charge and the main explosive charge may degrade the performance of the warhead .

Another known warhead is shown in as including an initiator which is configured to move longitudinally within the case . More particularly the initiator housing is rigidly coupled to the warhead case and defines a chamber or passageway in which the initiator floats. As such the initiator may move up and down within its housing to maintain contact with the main explosive charge . In certain instances springs may be used to exert a downward force against the initiator thereby facilitating contact between the initiator and the explosive charge . As noted above maintaining contact between the initiator and the main explosive charge may be important particularly when using a weaker initiator in order to provide satisfactory performance of the main explosive charge or when greater initiation precision is desired.

With reference now to in order to facilitate contact between the initiator and the main explosive charge it is known to use an end former for casting a precision upper surface on the main explosive charge . Spruel holes may be utilized to either cast liquid explosive through the end former or permit the discharge of excess liquid explosive therethrough.

There remains a need for a warhead with increased performance through consistently reliable and precise initiation of the main explosive charge and more particularly by allowing the initiator to maintain full and continuous contact with the main explosive charge as the relative position between the case and upper surface of the main explosive charge changes. There is also a need to simplify and economize production of warheads by eliminating the need to end form a precision upper surface on the main explosive charge. There is a further need to permit initiator removal and replacement while maintaining the main explosive charge within the case. There is also a need to improve the safety of warheads by protecting the relatively sensitive initiator from the case of the warhead.

According to an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure an explosive warhead includes a case defining a longitudinal axis and a main explosive charge received within the case. An explosive initiator includes an embedded portion received within the main explosive charge. A coupler is positioned intermediate the main explosive charge and the embedded portion of the initiator and releasably couples the initiator to the main explosive charge. The explosive initiator maintains continuous contact with the main explosive charge by moving longitudinally with the main explosive charge during thermal expansion and contraction. Illustratively the coupler includes a plurality of threads formed within the main explosive charge and a plurality of mating threads supported by the embedded portion of the initiator.

According to another illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure an explosive warhead includes a case defining a longitudinal axis a main explosive charge received within the case and an explosive initiator which includes an embedded portion received within the main explosive charge. A longitudinally extending spruel hole is formed within the initiator and receives a portion of the main explosive charge.

According to a further illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure an explosive warhead includes a case a main explosive charge received within the case and an explosive initiator including an embedded portion received within the main explosive charge. A ullage is disposed intermediate the explosive initiator and the case wherein the explosive initiator maintains continuous contact with the main explosive charge by moving within the ullage during thermal expansion and contraction of the main explosive charge.

According to yet another illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure a method of forming an explosive warhead includes the steps of providing a case coupling an initiator to a placement fixture and positioning the placement fixture such that the initiator is suspended within a liquid explosive received within the case. The method further includes the step of curing the liquid explosive to a hardened condition such that the initiator is at least partially embedded within and supported by the explosive.

The method further includes the steps of casting a liquid explosive within the case such that at least a portion of the initiator is received within the liquid explosive when suspended within the case by the placement fixture and curing the liquid explosive to a hardened condition such that the initiator is at least partially embedded within and supported by the explosive.

According to a further illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure a method of forming an explosive warhead includes the steps of providing a case providing an initiator including threads and coupling the initiator to a placement fixture. The method further includes the steps of coupling the placement fixture to the case such that the initiator is suspended within the case and casting a liquid explosive within the case such that at least a portion of the initiator is received within the liquid explosive when suspended within the case by the placement fixture. The method further includes the steps of heating the liquid explosive such that the explosive hardens the initiator is at least partially embedded within and supported by the explosive and mating threads are formed within the explosive and cooperate with the threads of the initiator. The method further includes the steps of uncoupling the initiator from the placement fixture after the explosive hardens cooling the explosive after uncoupling the initiator such that the initiator moves with the explosive in response to thermal contraction and uncoupling the placement fixture from the case.

Additional features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of the illustrative embodiment exemplifying the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently perceived.

The embodiments of the invention described herein are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to precise forms disclosed. Rather the embodiments selected for description have been chosen to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention.

Referring to an illustrative warhead includes a warhead case defining a longitudinal axis . The warhead case may be of conventional design including a housing and a cap or lid . More particularly the housing includes a cylindrical side wall supporting a bottom wall and a retaining flange . While the illustrative warhead case is generally cylindrical it should be appreciated that other shapes may also be utilized. The lid may be secured to the flange in a conventional manner such as through fasteners or adhesive not shown . The case may be formed of known materials such as aluminum if accurate dimensions are required or thermoplastics if more dimensional tolerance is permissible. Conventional manufacturing processes may be used to form the housing and lid .

An initiator is received within the case and illustratively includes a support member supporting an explosive such as an explosive booster that is configured to cause detonation of a main explosive charge . Illustrative explosive boosters may be formed of pentolite or PBXN 5. As is known pentolite is a mixture of pentaerythritol tetranitrate PETN and trinitrotoluene TNT . PBXN 5 is a known plastic bonded explosive detailed by military specification NAVY MIL E 81111B. An illustrative main explosive charge is plastic bonded explosive PBXN 110 as detailed by military specification NAVY MIL DTL 82901. In certain embodiments the support member itself may be formed of an explosive material and as such may not necessarily support a separate explosive booster. In such instances the support member may be formed of known explosives such as PBXW 128 or LX 14. An explosive coupler illustratively a precision initiation coupler PIC operably couples the initiator to a flexible detonation coupler or cord . The flexible detonation coupler is operably coupled to a conventional detonator or safe arm device . The coupler extends from the embedded initiator through an opening in the explosive cavity lid and attaches to the warhead detonator or safe arm device . The flexible detonation coupler allows the initiator to move within the warhead case as the main explosive charge flexes or moves due to thermal contraction and expansion.

The initiator illustratively includes a lower portion embedded within the explosive charge . In other words the lower portion is positioned below an upper surface of the explosive charge . The lower portion of the initiator illustratively includes a plurality of external threads which operably couple with mating internal threads formed within the main explosive charge . The cooperating threads and facilitate continuous contact between the initiator and the main explosive charge while permitting the initiator to be removed from the main explosive charge . Illustratively the explosive initiator may include one or more longitudinally extending spruel holes . The spruel holes may receive a portion of the main explosive charge when liquid. As such once the explosive charge hardens the spruel holes facilitate continuous and enhanced contact between the initiator and the explosive charge .

An ullage is defined intermediate the lid and the embedded initiator . The ullage permits longitudinal movement of the initiator in response to movement of the main explosive charge due to thermal expansion and contraction. A biasing member illustratively a resilient ring is received within the ullage intermediate the lid and the initiator . The biasing member exerts a longitudinally downward force against the initiator thereby facilitating continuous contact between the initiator and the main explosive charge particularly during occurrences of force or vibration. The biasing member permits the initiator to float with the upper surface of the main explosive charge due to thermal expansion and contraction.

With reference now to a further illustrative embodiment warhead is shown including many components similar to those detailed above with respect to warhead . As such components of warhead that are similar to those identified above with respect to warhead are identified with like reference numbers. The warhead includes case receiving an initiator having an explosive coupler in communication with a detonator or safe arm device through a flexible detonation cord . The explosive coupler may include a precision initiation coupler PIC which is operably coupled to an intermediate explosive charge illustratively including a PBXN 301 logic charge. As known PBXN 301 is an explosive often used in initiating devices. It is formulated from twenty percent sylgard resin system resin plus curative and eighty percent pentaerythritol tetranitrate PETN . The intermediate charge is received within a recess or cavity formed in an upper surface of the initiator . Explosive boosters are operably coupled to the intermediate explosive charge and a main explosive charge . While separate boosters are illustrated in it should be appreciated that any number of boosters may be utilized including a single annular booster.

The initiator includes a support member having internal threads which cooperate with mating external threads of the main explosive charge . Spruel holes illustratively extend through the supporting member of the initiator and are configured to allow for the passage of the explosive charge therethrough when in a liquid state. A ullage is defined intermediate the upper surface of the initiator and the lid . Again the ullage permits longitudinal movement of the initiator in response to thermal expansion and contraction of the main explosive charge .

With reference now to illustrative methods of forming a warhead including an embedded initiator will be described. The initiator may be similar to initiators and detailed above. Illustratively the initiator may also include an outer surface including features that will allow it to be precisely located and secured in the uncured main explosive charge as necessary. Such features may include fastener attachment points on the outer surface of the initiator for coupling to a placement fixture . The attachment points may include threaded apertures configured to receive threaded fasteners . The placement fixture may be a permanent part of the warhead or a temporary device used to secured the embedded initiator to the main explosive charge until the main explosive charge cures or hardens enough to hold the embedded initiator in place without assistance.

The initiator may also include an outer housing receiving the support member . Illustratively the initiator housing and the placement fixture may be formed from material allowing the precision necessary for desired warhead performance. If accurate initiation location is needed such as in the use of a shaped charge warhead material is used allowing for high tolerance such as aluminum. If less accurate initiation location is required such as in fragmentation or blast warheads materials offering less tolerance such as thermoplastics may be used. Consideration is also given to the contribution the initiator housing material will make in regard to the energy output of the warhead . Some materials such as aluminum titanium and high carbon explosives are more reactive in combustion and will contribute more to the warhead energy output.

As noted above there may be little or no housing surrounding the initiator . In such a case the bare support member and any boosters may be made with fixture attachment points and located using the placement fixture . Bare boosters may be made with a precision integral flexible detonation cord extending from it. The smaller and lighter the initiator is made the better it will stay embedded during times of warhead vibration and acceleration.

The outer surface of the initiator is illustratively configured to firmly secure the embedded initiator into the main explosive charge . For example surface treatments or bonding agents may be supported on the exterior of the initiator to promote bonding of the housing to the main explosive charge . In one illustrative embodiment perforations or protrusions about the housing may be used to create a physical mechanical lock between the initiator and the main explosive charge . Providing a texture or roughing up the exterior of the surface of the initiator could be used to promote bonding to the explosive and ridges could be placed on the initiator side wall to lock the initiator into the explosive charge . As noted above threads formed on the outside of the initiator cause mating threads to be formed within the main explosive charge . The cooperating threads and provide for uncoupling through unthreading of the initiator from the main explosive charge after the main explosive charge has cured or hardened.

Once the initiator has been properly configured it is suspended within the housing of case . This step may be done either before or after the housing has been filled or cast with the liquid explosive charge . More particularly the initiator is coupled to the placement fixture using the attachment points on the initiator . More particularly conventional fasteners may be used to couple the initiator to the placement fixture . The placement fixture in turn is coupled to the case illustratively by fasteners extending through apertures within a mounting flange formed in the placement fixture and threadably received within apertures formed in the housing .

If the initiator is suspended within an empty case the explosive charge is cast into the housing through at least one opening formed within the placement fixture . As shown in such an opening may comprise a spruel hole configured to permit the liquid explosive charge to pass therethrough. The liquid explosive charge is cast to the required depth in order to achieve the desired initiator embedding. The explosive charge may be cast under vacuum or with vibration as necessary to get the needed charge quality and contact with the initiator . If the initiator is embedded into a precast explosive charge it may be attached to the placement fixture and thereby positioned within the housing . Vibration and vacuum may be applied after embedding as necessary for charge quality and contact between the initiator and the main explosive charge .

In certain illustrative embodiments as shown in the placement fixture may include an end former defined by a substantially planar lower surface . The lower surface is configured to produce a precise upper surface on the main explosive charge .

Once the initiator is embedded and the placement fixture is properly positioned the explosive charge is allowed to cure harden. This step is commonly done at a warm temperature illustratively between 100 F. and 150 F. to promote faster cure. More particularly main explosive charges comprised of plastics have a higher thermal coefficient of expansion than metal or composite cases in which they are usually maintained. When the liquid explosive charge and the embedded initiator are warmed in a cure oven the explosive charge will rise or move longitudinally in regard to the position of the initiator because the initiator is locked in position relative to the warhead case via the placement fixture .

After cure such that the explosive charge has hardened but before the warhead is allowed to cool the initiator is illustratively disconnected from the placement fixture . This step will allow the initiator to recede or move longitudinally with the explosive charge as it cools in relation to the case due to thermal contraction.

Rubber epoxy or other liquid potting may be poured into the warhead case and on top of the explosive surface to further embed the initiator and provide additional coupling between the initiator and the explosive charge . This potting would cure solid. Prior to coupling the lid to the housing biasing member such as a foam pad or springs may be placed above the initiator . The biasing member would push again the closed lid of the case and provide a longitudinally downwardly extending force to keep the initiator down into the explosive main charge during movement for example due to force or vibration. Such a biasing member would still allow the initiator to float with the explosive surface within the ullage as the surface level changes in regard to the case due to thermal changes.

Referring now to a further illustrative embodiment placement fixture is shown as being in the form of a spider. More particularly the spider includes an outer member illustratively an annular ring configured to be coupled to the housing through conventional fasteners threadably received within apertures formed within the housing . A cross member is supported by the outer member . More particularly cross member includes arms extending radially inwardly from the outer member and supports a plurality of downwardly extending legs supporting an inner member illustratively an annular ring. The inner member is positioned below the outer member and radially inwardly therefrom and is configured to couple to the attachment points of the initiator illustratively through conventional fasteners threadably received within apertures . As such the inner member supports the initiator below the outer member in a suspended position within the case . The spider may be integral non removable with the warhead or removable once the explosive solidifies and can hold the embedded initiator on its own.

A further illustrative method to place the embedded initiator would be to machine or form a hole for receiving the initiator after the main explosive charge is cured. In another illustrative embodiment an end former could be used to form a void in the explosive charge . The end former is a temporary device similar to the placement fixture described above but with an inert shaped surface to mold a surface hole in the explosive charge . The initiator could then be pushed and seated into the formed void. It could be bonded in place or even threaded into the void and the void in the initiator were produced with screw threads. An attachment such as this would offer less precision than placement of the initiator into the liquid explosive charge but might have cost or other advantages.

It should be appreciated that multiple initiators may be embedded into the main explosive charge at various locations to control the direction of the explosive blast. Proper initiator placement would be based desired detonation direction. The embedded initiator could be completely submerged within the explosive with only its flexible coupler protruding.

Since the embedded initiator will remain in intimate and continuous contact with the main explosive charge the output of any explosive such as boosters may be reduced. In other words there will be no air gap that needs to be jumped by the detonation wave of the initiator . As such some IMAD insensitive munitions advanced development compliant boosters may be usable in this configuration. These boosters are resistant to bullet impact and other unintended initiation stimuli but sometimes need to be very close to the main charge not good gap jumpers . The use of an IMAD booster may substantially increase the safety of the warhead . Not only can any air gap between the booster and the main explosive charge be eliminated but the booster itself may be embedded without any barrier between it and the main explosive charge .

Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain exemplary embodiments variations and modifications exist within the spirit and scope of the invention as described and defined in the following claims.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
