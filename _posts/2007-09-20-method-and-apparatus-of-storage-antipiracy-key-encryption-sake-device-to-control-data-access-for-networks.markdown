This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 339 696 filed on Jan. 8 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 353 399 the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to the field of network communications. More specifically the present invention relates to a secured access to restricted information over the networks.

The piracy and illegal copying of software and other digital media has become extremely pervasive and currently results in billions of dollars in lost revenue for media and software owners worldwide. This problem is compounded by the advent of faster and more technologically advanced computers the development of inexpensive mass storage media i.e. CDs DVDs as well as copying devices such as CD writers which aid in various aspects of digital piracy.

Each technological breakthrough seemingly results in a new and better way to illegally copy intellectual property belonging to another. Examples of digital piracy include the copying of proprietary software to sell to others the installing of a single proprietary software package on several different systems placing a copy of proprietary software on the Internet or even downloading copyrighted images from the Internet.

While digital piracy is fairly common among many end users who have lawfully purchased the software large scale piracy typically occurs at a reseller level. For instance a reseller may duplicate and distribute multiple copies of a software program a digital audio file or a digital video file to different customers. These counterfeit versions are sometimes passed on to unsuspecting customers. Hardware distributors have been known to preload different systems using a single software package. In such instances customers are either not provided with original manuals diskettes and or compact discs CDs or are simply supplied with pirated copies of the same.

Numerous methods to combat the rampant problem of digital piracy have been devised. One of the methods is the used of trialware to restrict usage of a software product. Trialware may be implemented by either programming an expiration date or a usage counter into a software program. Such a scheme limits the use of a software product to a particular duration or a number of trial times respectively after which the protected application cart no longer be launched. Users are then forced to either purchase the full version of the product or to quit using it altogether.

Hardware keys are another type of anti piracy device that is commonly used to prevent illegal use of software. Hardware keys are devices that are plugged into selected ports of a computer. Once the software is executed it then detects the presence of a hardware key in a similar manner to detecting other hardware devices such as a printer monitor or a mouse . Programming the software such that it only operates when an appropriate hardware key is attached prevents illegal use of the software. As the number of hardware keys distributed to end users correspond to the number of seat licenses purchased the software will not work when installed on another system without the requisite hardware key.

Another common anti piracy technique is to require the entry of a certain registration key that is supplied by the software company before the software can be installed. Traditionally the registration keys are given only with the original software package although some are issued electronically. Unfortunately there is nothing to prevent the holder of the registration key from installing the software on multiple systems. In addition many of the electronic registration keys are based on the user s personal information i.e. such as the user s name therefore some backers have developed programs to calculate registration keys for random names.

Unfortunately as with the use of the registration key all of the above anti piracy systems and many others are easily circumvented by hackers. A common method of combating these anti piracy techniques is to disassemble the coding of the Application Programming Interface API to assembly language and thereafter decompile the assembly language into programming language. With the knowledge gained from the program flow the hacker can easily re write the program or set certain conditions within the program itself such that it bypasses all the anti piracy authentication algorithms.

In view of the foregoing it is extremely desirable to have an anti piracy system that cannot be easily re programmed or bypassed by computer hackers or other digital pirates. It is also desirable to have an anti piracy system that cart be integrated with existing mass storage devices.

According to one aspect of the present invention a method of SAKE is provided in which SAKE is coupled to a host or client system and SAKE obtains user s biometric identity information through its biometric sensor. User s biometric identity information such as fingerprints is verified according to the biometric templates stored in an internal memory unit of SAKE. Various initialization information including public key associated with the user is retrieved from the internal memory unit of SAKE and the initialization information is provided to an information provider or Internet Service Provider ISP via a computer network such as Internet through the host system. Upon verifying the initialization information a network communication is established between SAKE and the information provider. When SAKE obtains information from the information provider the information is encrypted and stored in a flash memory within SAKE.

Additional features and benefits of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description figures and claims set forth below.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that these specific details may not be required to practice the present invention. In other instances well known circuits and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid obscuring the present invention.

It is understood that the present invention may contain transistor circuits that are readily manufacturable using well known art such as for example CMOS complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology or other semiconductor manufacturing processes. In addition the present invention may be implemented with other manufacturing processes for making digital devices.

In other embodiments of the present invention ROM unit may be formed as part of microcontroller . Furthermore both first storage unit and second storage unit may be one of a number of mass storage devices including hard drives floppy disks or removable flash memory devices such as the ThumbDrive manufactured by Trek 2000. In addition the two storage units may be utilized in one physical structure to form a single mass storage device. The mass storage device may also be placed with microcontroller to form a single chip.

First storage unit stores an authentication sequence which is used to verify password . An authentication algorithm to authenticate password with authentication sequence is programmed onto ROM twit . In addition ROM unit preferably comprises a shutdown algorithm . Because these algorithms and other data are hard coded the contents of ROM unit cannot be decompiled or altered. Upon receiving password microcontroller loads and executes authentication algorithm to verify password with authentication sequence . Access to second storage unit s permitted only if password is verified.

Password may be entered by a user or a software program executed by host after receiving a query from microcontroller . Because authentication algorithm is hard coded onto ROM unit copying or decompiling and changing the software program resident on host does not breach the copy protection provided by the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that password may be a private string of characters a sequence of communication protocols or some other security protocol known only to an authorized user. In addition password and authentication sequence may form part of a biometric authentication process by using a user s fingerprints iris face or voice as authentication means.

Password may also be programmed into the software running on host and recognizable only by authentication algorithm and therefore not known to an end user. As described above authentication algorithm is preferably implemented on hardware or firmware such as ROM unit so that it is tamper resistant that is authentication algorithm will be either extremely difficult to reverse engineer or extract data from and therefore extremely difficult to bypass.

Shutdown algorithm is preferably implemented as a deterrent against brute force attacks by shutting down the entire system if a series of incorrect passwords is received by microcontroller . An authentication system programmer may define the maximum number of incorrect passwords allowed before the system shuts down. Shutdown algorithm may also be programmed to not accept anymore password entries or a specified amount of time. By using shutdown algorithm trial and error methods used by brute force application programs to identify password would become an extremely tedious process for hackers. The algorithm would therefore deter potential hackers from even attempting to identify password .

Second storage unit is used to store programs and or files which are required for a program on host to run. Examples of such files include executable programs such as a software installer digital audio files digital video files image files text files and library files. Microcontroller allows access to second storage unit from host only if the correct password has been received by microcontroller .

Although illustrated in this embodiment as separate entities it should be evident to a person skilled in the art that microcontroller first storage unit ROM unit and second storage unit may be combined in a number of ways. For example microcontroller first storage unit ROM unit and second storage unit may be implemented on a single semiconductor chip. In an alternative embodiment microcontroller and ROM unit may be implemented on a chip that is separate from the storage units.

The present invention therefore has great flexibility of design that may easily be altered depending on a user s requirements. For example on one hand the use of multiple chips may allow different vendors to manufacture different parts of the authentication system. On the other hand fabricating the present invention onto fewer hips or a single chip may be less expensive and provide better performance. In addition if ROM unit and microcontroller are located on the same chip it may be more difficult to separate the ROM to read the data stored.

Upon receiving password microcontroller loads and executes authentication algorithm to verify password with authentication sequence . Access to second storage unit is permitted only if password is verified. Shutdown algorithm preferably shuts down the entire system if a series of wrong passwords is received by microcontroller . An authentication system programmer determines the maximum number of incorrect password attempts allowed.

Data to be read from or written onto second storage unit is first decrypted or encrypted respectively by encoder . Many different encryption schemes may be used by encoder including International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA Data Encryption Standard DES encryption. Triple Data Encryption Standard 3 DES encryption and Pretty Good Privacy PGP . By encrypting the contents of a second storage unit a hacker will not be able to make sense of the contents even if he manages to read the contents bypassing microcontroller for example by using a probe After password has been authenticated a decoder not illustrated may be used to decrypt the contents of second storage unit .

Alternatively the data stored in second storage unit may be protected by hash coding. In addition authentication sequence is preferably encrypted or hashed as well prevent hackers from unraveling authentication sequence . This may be accomplished without requiring an additional encoder if first storage unit is located thin second storage unit .

As described in previous embodiments upon receiving password microcontroller loads and executes authentication algorithm to verify password with authentication sequence . Access to storage unit is permitted only if password is verified. Shutdown algorithm is preferably used to shut down the entire system if a series of incorrect passwords is received by microcontroller .

By hard coding authentication sequence directly into authentication algorithm possibly in multiple places modification of authentication sequence becomes substantially more difficult. In order to change a hard code authentication sequence not only is recompilation necessary if using a compiled language but also sufficient understanding of the implementation is required to ensure that the change will not cause program failure. Such a measure makes it difficult for a hacker to re program authentication system .

Storage unit is made up of two types of data storage areas a public storage area and a private storage area . An authentication sequence which is used to verify password is stored in private storage area . An authentication algorithm to authenticate password is programmed onto ROM unit . ROM unit also contains a shutdown algorithm . Public storage area and private storage area may be created by under declaring the memory size available on storage unit .

Take for example a storage unit with physical addresses ranging from 000 to 1000 if only physical addresses 000 to 500 are declared to an operating system OS such as Windows on host the OS will not be aware of the presence of physical addresses 501 to 1000. Under such circumstances data stored within physical addresses 000 to 500 will be accessible to any user. This area is known as a public storage area. Conversely undeclared physical addresses 501 to 1000 form a private storage area since these tresses are only be available to microcontroller and cart only be accessed by an authorized user or software program.

Under non secure operating conditions any user may instruct host to read data from or write data onto public storage area . However if a user wishes to access private storage area the user or the software program must first enter password which is then sent to microcontroller for authentication. Upon receiving password microcontroller executes authentication algorithm to verify password with authentication sequence . Access to private storage area is permitted only if password is verified. Shutdown algorithm shuts down the entire system if a series of incorrect passwords is received by microcontroller .

If the password is verified in decision block access to a private area such as second storage unit in the above described embodiments will be permitted in a block . The user is then able to read from or write onto the second storage unit which is preferably encrypted. If the password is not verified in decision block the user will be denied access to the second storage unit and method will end in a block . Alternatively if the password is incorrect the user may be given additional chances to enter the right password. However system is preferably shut down if a series of incorrect passwords is received by the microcontroller.

To retrieve data from web server a password received by host is verified by authentication system . The password is typically entered by a user or by software the host if the password is entered by the user the authentication system may also be configured to accept a biometrics password such as a fingerprint or a retina scan. If the verification is successful authentication system sends a request through host for access to web sewer . Upon receiving the request web server grants access to a web page having the secured data. The data may be in the form of a music file or an online book or a software program. Because the authentication algorithm in authentication system is hard coded an unauthorized user will not be able to circumvent or change the verification scheme in authentication system and hence will be unable to access the data on web server .

In another embodiment of the present invention the password is embedded in the data to be retrieved from web server . Host sends a request for the data to web server . Upon receiving the request web server sends the password embedded in the requested data to authentication system for verification. If the verification is successful authentication system allows host to access the data whereupon it may be displayed or executed. In a preferred embodiment the data from web server is encrypted. Decryption of the data is carried out in authentication system before use in host or storage in authentication system .

Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention. Furthermore certain terminology has been used for the purposes of descriptive clarity and not to limit the present invention. The embodiments and preferred features described above should be considered exemplary with the invention being defined by the appended claims.

According to one aspect of the present invention a method of SAKE is provided in which SAKE is coupled to a host or client system and SAKE obtains user s biometric identity information through its biometric sensor. User s biometric identity information such as fingerprints is verified according to the biometric templates stored in an internal memory unit of SAKE. Various initialization information including public key associated with the user is retrieved from the internal memory unit of SAKE and the initialization information is provided to an information provider or Internet Service Provider ISP via a computer network such as Internet through the host system. Upon verifying the initialization information a network communication is established between SAKE and the information provider. When SAKE obtains information from the information provider the information is encrypted and stored in a flash memory within SAKE.

In one embodiment SAKE is a storage and anti piracy device that includes onboard biometric verification capability. SAKE has universal connectivity capabilities such as USB connectors. High speed data transfer and large memory capacity are other advantages of SAKE. For example SAKE may have the memory capacity of one gigabytes and have an access speed up to one gigabit per second. A more detailed discussion of SAKE will be discussed later.

The content provider of online transaction includes various online sale transactions which includes online sales of merchandises software information and network services over the Internet.

An advantage of using SAKE is to prevent unauthorized rampant copying of commercial information.

The content provider of Internet sites includes various restricted web sites which require for example memberships to access the information posted on the restricted web sites. In one embodiment SAKE provides a controlled access to restricted Internet sites. In another embodiment SAKE provides a method of controlled distribution of information received by SAKE. An advantage of using SAKE in this case is to prevent unauthorized access.

The content provider of Services in one aspect includes various online services that provide support resources and or upgrades. In one embodiment SAKE provides a method of providing services and or upgrades to clients who are authorized and or registered for the services. An advantage of using SAKE in this case is to prevent unauthorized party to receive services.

The content provider of medical data in one aspect contains medical information such as a restricted hospital web site. In one embodiment SAKE provides a secured method to retrieve personal medical information over the Internet from the content provider for medical data . An advantage of using SAKE in this case is to prevent unauthorized party to access personal medical data.

The content provider of e learning in one aspect includes various online educational materials that are either posted on the web page or downloaded from the web site. In one embodiment SAKE provides a secured method to download various educational and or learning materials to from the content provider to various clients who are authorized and or registered to receive the educational materials. An advantage of using SAKE in this case is to prevent unauthorized party to download the educational materials from the content provider of e learning .

The content provider of library and publisher in one aspect includes various online books and articles that either can be checked out or purchased. In one embodiment SAKE provides a secured method of purchase or checkout by downloading digital a copy of book and or article for authorized users. An advantage of using SAKE in this case is to prevent unauthorized party to obtain copies of books and articles posted on the web sites.

The content provider of Music and television games movies in one aspect includes various online digital music and games movies that either can be checked out or purchased. In one embodiment SAKE provides a secured method of purchase or check out a digital copy of music games and or movies for authorized users. An advantage of using SAKE in this case is to prevent unauthorized party to obtain copies of music games and or movies posted on the web sites.

In operation when for example a user desires to purchase a software from a website a SAKE first authenticates the user which may involve biometric identification process. After the identity of the user is verified SAKE notifies the website with an access request and security codes. Upon acknowledgement of access request and security codes the website which could act through an ISP establishes a network communication with SAKE over the Internet . An encrypted public key is subsequently forwarded from SAKE to the website to confirm the true identity of user. Once the user identity is confirmed by the website it sends the requested software to SAKE via SAKE s host system. Upon receiving the software it is directly stored in the flash memory of SAKE with limited or no trace in the host system.

An advantage of using SAKE function as an anti piracy device is to prevent unauthorized copying of information over the Internet. Another advantage of using SAKE is to store the downloaded contents directly into SAKE only thereby there is no traces on the host system after SAKE is disconnected from the host system. Another advantage is to employ personal and biometric information to authenticate users before the users are given access to quality contents over a network such as Internet or Intranet.

Processor is coupled to buses for communicating information to and from various components. Processor includes microprocessor processor central processing unit or digital processing unit such as Pentium PowerPC Alpha and the like. Processor controls the data flow of SAKE through executing instructions. In one embodiment processor executes navigation software which may be stored in internal memory for controlling the data flow.

Internal memory in one embodiment is a flash memory designed to store authentication data such as public keys private keys biometric templates et cetera. It should be noted that public keys private keys and biometric templates are loaded into internal memory during the setup or initialization of SAKE . Internal memory is coupled to processor through dedicated bus for fast data store and fetch. In another embodiment Internal memory is coupled to processor through system bus . Biometric templates include fingerprint and or iris templates. In another embodiment internal memory stores the navigation software which is responsible to control data flow between ISP and SAKE. The navigation software is also responsible to retrieve data from flash memory and then display the data.

Biometric sensor is coupled to biometric verification unit via bus wherein biometric sensor detects biometric information or patterns from a user. For example fingerprint sensor as a biometric sensor detects fingerprint patterns from the user who is currently holding SAKE . Once the fingerprint of the user is obtained it is forwarded from the fingerprint sensor to biometric verification unit for authenticating the user. Upon receipt of the biometric information biometric verification unit fetches biometric templates such as fingerprint templates from internal memory via processor and authenticates the biometric information just received against biometric templates. The result of the authentication is forwarded to processor . It should be noted that the biometric templates are loaded during the initialization of SAKE.

USB controller is coupled to system bus and USB connector via a dedicated bus . USB controller is designed to control communication between SAKE and the host system not shown in . USB connector in one embodiment is a USB plug that is capable to directly connect to a USB port of host system. USB connector is designed to support entire weight of SAKE while it is plugged in a USB port. It is further noted that when SAKE is plugged in a USB port of the host system only a portion of SAKE is inserted into the host system.

Hashing algorithm is coupled to system bus to perform a hash function. Hashing algorithm is in one embodiment a standard hashing algorithm such as secure hash standard SHS and is designed to hash public keys before they are being sent to their destination over the Internet.

Flash memory is coupled to MCU via bus and is configured to store large amounts of data. For example flash memory can store up to one gigabyte. In one embodiment flash memory has capacity of mass storage and data downloaded from the ISP can be directly stored in flash memory . To secure data from hacking data is encrypted before it is stored in flash memory . Encryption decryption unit is coupled to system bus and coupled to flash memory via bus . In one embodiment Encryption decryption unit which may be a standard encryption code encrypts data according to a private key before it stores in flash memory . Encryption decryption unit is also used to decrypt data according a private key after the data is fetched from flash memory .

Tamper proof unit is coupled to system bus . A function of tamper proof unit is designed to erase data stored in internal memory and flash memory when tamper proof unit detects tampering or hacking SAKE using high temperature voltage and or frequency. In one embodiment tamper proof unit contains sensors that can detect abnormal conditions such as voltage frequency and temperature are beyond the specification.

At block biometric sensor detects user s biometric information and forwards the detected biometric information to biometric verification unit. The verification unit authenticates the detected biometric information against biometric template stored in the internal memory. When the user s identity is authenticated which means the biometric information such as fingerprint matches with the biometric template the process moves to block .

At block the process retrieves initialization information from the internal memory. In one embodiment the initialization information includes a security code and a public key. The security code which may vary between ISPs is used to establish an initial communication between SAKE and the ISP. The process proceeds to block .

At block the process forwards the security code to an associated ISP and request to establish communication. Once the communication is formed the public key is forwarded to the ISP to confirm that the true user is communicating with the ISP. The process moves to block .

At block a communication between SAKE and the ISP is established and ISP is ready to perform user s request. The process moves to block .

At block SAKE receives requested information such as a copy of digital book or a movie. When the requested information is encrypted the process moves to block .

At block the process stores the encrypted data in the flash memory of SAKE. The process moves to the next block.

In step to initiate the authentication process a user accesses a login web page of a content provider utilizing an embodiment of the authentication method of the present invention. Typically the user navigates the Web using common internet browser software e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer installed on a client computer connected to the Internet. To access the designated login page the user enters the web page address e.g. URL address of the login page or click on a hyperlink or bookmark pointing to that address. Depending on the particular application the client computer can be a desktop computer a laptop computer a personal digital assistant PDA a point of sale POS terminal a television a gaming console a networked kiosk or any other network enabled device that allows the user to interact with the content server. In one embodiment the login page is stored on a content server and is programmed to include a Login button or link which when clicked causes the content server to generate a command that initiates the authentication process. Accordingly the user clicks on the Login button to start the authentication process.

In step the SAKE device which in one embodiment comprises a USB plug that is plugged into a USB port of the client computer receives the command from the content server. This command establishes communication between the content server and the SAKE device. The command also serves to notify the SAKE device that the content server is ready to receive information pertaining to the authentication process from the SAKE device.

In step the SAKE device captures biometric information from the user via a biometric detector that is built into the SAKE device. In a currently preferred embodiment the biometric detector is a built in fingerprint sensor on an upwardly facing surface of the SAKE device. When the user places his her thumb on the sensor the thumbprint is captured for verification by the SAKE device as described in step immediately below. While fingerprinting is described herein as an identity authentication technique it is appreciated that other biometric based techniques such as iris scan can also be used in accordance with the present invention.

In step the captured biometric information is verified against stored biometric template s of one or more authorized user s . In one embodiment when the SAKE device is assigned to an authorized user the fingerprint of that authorized user is captured and stored into the SAKE device as a fingerprint template. In an embodiment where multiple authorized users are supported a separate template is created and stored for each authorized user. Thereafter when a person wants to access restricted contents on a server for which the SAKE device is assigned that person s fingerprint can be verified by a fingerprint verification engine in the SAKE device against the stored fingerprint template s of the authorized user s .

If in step it is determined that the captured biometric information e.g. fingerprint matches the stored biometric template or one of the templates in the case of multiple authorized users then in step the SAKE device transmits a notification to the content server indicating to the server that the current user s identity has been authenticated biometrically.

In step the SAKE device receives a device authentication request from the content server. In a preferred embodiment the content server transmits a device authentication request to the SAKE device upon receiving the notification of user identity authentication from the SAKE device as described in step above.

In step the SAKE device transmits a device authentication reply to the content server in response to the device authentication request described in step above. Significantly the device authentication reply allows the SAKE device and the content server to complete an authentication handshake. The SAKE device is programmed to generate a device authentication reply is characteristics of and is recognizable by the particular content server. Therefore the reply enables the server to verify that the SAKE device is properly assigned to the user for accessing restricted content on the server. In accordance with a preferred embodiment the device authentication reply includes multiple authentication sequences with each sequence being transmitted to the server separately. For example after transmitting a first authentication sequence the SAKE device can wait for a confirmation sequence from the server before transmitting the next sequence itself. Any number of sequences can be used in the authentication handshake allowing for flexibility in customization. In a preferred embodiment different content servers have different authentication handshakes with their corresponding SAKE devices so that a given SAKE device assigned for a particular content server will be of no use in accessing restricted content on another content server.

In step the SAKE device receives a key request from the content server. In a preferred embodiment the content server transmits a key request to the SAKE device when the authentication handshake described above in step is completed. In other words when the content server has ascertained that the request for restricted content originates from a legitimate SAKE device properly assigned for that purpose the server sends a key request to the SAKE device.

In step the SAKE device transmits a first key representative of the user s identity to the content server in response to the key request described in step above. This first key enables the server to confirm the user s identity. In a preferred embodiment the first key is a public key e.g. as used under the Public Key Infrastructure or PKI that uniquely identify the key holder to third parties such as the content server in this case. In one embodiment the public key is hashed using a secure hashing algorithm preferably stored in a non volatile solid state memory before transmission to the content server. It is appreciated that according to the present invention the key verification can be performed by the content server itself or by a certifying authority CA on behalf of the content server.

In step the SAKE device receives the restricted content from the content server as requested. In one embodiment the restricted content is received by the SAKE device as one or more data streams. In other words the content is transmitted from the content server to the SAKE device by streaming.

It should be appreciated that according to a preferred embodiment described above the content server only sends the restricted content to the SAKE device after a successful biometric authentication of the user s identity a successful authentication handshake between the content server and the SAKE device and a successful verification of the user s identity using a unique key such as a public key. The tri level authentication process of the present invention as described provided very strong security protection against unauthorized access of restricted content stored on the content server.

In step the SAKE device encrypts the content received from the content server In a preferred embodiment the encryption is performed using a second key representative of the user s identity. In one embodiment the second key is a private key assigned to the user.

In step the SAKE device stores the encrypted content in its memory. The stored content is secured against unauthorized access because it is in encrypted form and cannot be decrypted without the second key e.g. private key described above in step . In one embodiment the encrypted content is stored in a non volatile solid state memory.

In a preferred embodiment the SAKE device includes one or more of a voltage detector a frequency detector and a temperature detector e.g. thermometer thermostat to further protect the stored information against tampering. These detectors monitor the operation parameters of voltage frequency and temperature. It is appreciated that common hacking techniques involve altering the voltage frequency and or temperature of the environment in which a storage device operates in an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the stored data. Thus according to this embodiment when the detectors detects that one or more of the operation parameters fall beyond their normal operating ranges as specified the SAKE device erases or otherwise destroy the encrypted data stored therein and optionally the first key the second key and the biometric template. This data self destruction feature provides a last line of defense against unauthorized access of the restricted content stored in the SAKE device.

Importantly content received from the content server goes directly to the SAKE device and is not stored on the client computer in any form. The internet browser serves as a conduit of data transfer between the content server and the SAKE device. The data transfer is transparent to the user and the content is neither displayed to the user in the browser nor is the content allowed to be stored on the client computer using the browser interface. In a preferred embodiment data is transferred by streaming which provides additional protection against hacking as portions of a data stream cannot be meaningfully reassembled in case of malicious interception. In one embodiment encrypted content received from the server is decrypted by the browser using standard decryption protocols such as DES AES 3 DS and then encrypted by the SAKE device using a private key before storing. In another embodiment the encrypted content is passed as is to the SAKE device which can performed additional decryption and or re encryption. The restricted content is stored within the SAKE device in encrypted form and cannot be replicated to another storage medium connected to the client computer. Moreover retrieval of the data is only allowed when the user s identity is authenticated through the biometric detector and verification engine.

Once the content is securely stored in the SAKE device an authorized user can gain access to the content by a successfully passing the biometric authentication thereby causing the SAKE device to decrypt the stored content and streaming it to the appropriate application program for processing. For example a music file or a movie file is decrypted and streamed to a media player for playback. An executable file is decrypted and then run from the SAKE device. A document is decrypted for viewing by a viewer word processing program straight from the SAKE device. Thus the content remains in the SAKE device and the streaming of the data is under the control of the SAKE device so that unauthorized access is prevented. In another embodiment the encrypted content is streamed for processing by the appropriate application program without being decrypted. In this embodiment a customized application program capable of processing the encrypted content is provided.

In the foregoing specification the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will however be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative rather than restrictive sense.
