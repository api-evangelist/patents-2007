The Government of the United States of America has certain rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. 70NANB4H3042 awarded by the U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The present invention relates generally to monitoring operating environments and in particular to instrumented components and telemetry systems enabled for wirelessly transmitting electronic data indicative of individual component condition within an operating environment such as that of a combustion turbine engine.

Embodiments of the present invention provide high temperature wireless telemetry systems configured for operation on rotating or stationary components within an operating environment having an operating temperature of approximately 450 C. or greater such as within certain sections of a combustion turbine engine.

An exemplary high temperature telemetry system for use in a combustion turbine engine may include at least one sensor deposited on a component such as a turbine blade. A telemetry transmitter circuit may be affixed to the turbine blade and a connecting material may be deposited on the turbine blade for routing electronic data signals from the sensor to the telemetry transmitter circuit the electronic data signals indicative of a condition of the turbine blade. An induction power system is provided for powering the telemetry transmitter circuit with a rotating data antenna affixed to the component such as the turbine blade and a stationary data antenna affixed to a static seal segment adjacent to the turbine blade.

In use air is drawn in through compressor where it is compressed and driven towards combustor . Combustor mixes the air with fuel and ignites it thereby forming a working gas. This working gas temperature will typically be above about 1300 C. This gas expands through turbine being guided across blades by vanes . As the gas passes through turbine it rotates blades and shaft thereby transmitting usable mechanical work through shaft . Combustion turbine may also include a cooling system not shown dimensioned and configured to supply a coolant for example steam or compressed air to blades and vanes .

The environment within which turbine blades and vanes operate is particularly harsh subject to high operating temperatures and a corrosive atmosphere which may result in serious deterioration of blades and vanes . This is especially likely if TBC should spall or otherwise deteriorate. Embodiments of the invention are advantageous because components may transmit real time or near real time data indicative of a component s condition during operation of combustion turbine .

U.S. Pat. No. 6 576 861 the disclosure of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference discloses a method and apparatus that may be used to deposit embodiments of sensors and connectors for connecting sensors with transmitters or otherwise routing data signals. In this respect methods and apparatus disclosed therein may be used for the patterning of fine sensor and or connector features of between about 100 microns and 500 microns without the need of using masks. Multilayer electrical circuits and sensors may be formed by depositing features using conductive materials resistive materials dielectric materials insulative materials and other application specific materials. Alternate methods may be used to deposit multilayer electrical circuits sensors and connectors such as thermal spraying vapor deposition laser sintering and curing deposits of material sprayed at lower temperatures may be used as well as other suitable techniques.

Transmitters may be multi channel and have various specifications depending on their location within a casing of combustion turbine . Transmitters may be configured to function within the early stages of compressor which are subject to operating temperatures of between about 80 C. to 120 C. Transmitters may be configured to function within later stages of compressor and or stages of turbine subject to operating temperatures of greater than about 120 C. and up to about 300 C. Transmitters may be fabricated using silicon on insulator SOI technology and other materials capable of operating in regions with temperatures greater than about 120 C.

One or more sensors may be connected with one or more compressor vanes by fabricating or depositing sensors and connectors directly onto a surface of vane . Connector may extend from sensor to a termination location such as the peripheral edge of vane so that a distal end of connector is exposed for connection to transmitter . Sensor and connector may be positioned on vane to minimize any adverse affect on the aerodynamics of vane . Embodiments allow for a distal end of connectors to be exposed at a termination location which may be proximate a peripheral edge of a component or other suitable location. This allows a field technician to quickly and easily connect connector to a transmitter regardless of its location.

Type K thermocouple materials NiCr or NiAl may be used in sections of compressor having an operating environment up to approximately 800 C. For example NiCr 20 may be used to deposit a strain gage in compressor . Type N thermocouple material such as alloys of NiCrSi and NiSi for example may be used for depositing sensors in sections of turbine having an operating environment between approximately 800 C. to 1150 C.

Type S B and R thermocouple materials may be used for depositing sensors in sections of turbine having an operating environment between approximately 1150 C. to 1350 C. For example Pt Rh Pt Rh 10 and Pt Rh 13 may be deposited to form sensors within turbine provided that the material generates an acceptable thermoelectric voltage for a particular application within combustion turbine . Ni alloys for example NiCr NiCrSi NiSi and other oxidation resistant Ni based alloys such as MCrAlX where M may be Fe Ni or Co and X may be Y Ta Si Hf Ti and combinations thereof may be used as sensing materials for high temperature applications in deeper sections of compressor and throughout turbine . These alloys may be used as sensing material deposited in various sensing configurations to form sensors such as heat flux sensors strain sensors and wear sensors.

Components within combustion turbine such as blades and or vanes may have application specific sensors deposited to conform to a component s surface and or embedded within a barrier or other coating deposited within combustion turbine . For example shows an exemplary turbine blade which may be a blade from row of turbine having high temperature resistant lead wires such as connectors deposited to connect an embedded or surface mounted sensor with a wireless telemetry device . Device may be mounted in a location where the telemetry components are exposed to relatively lower temperatures such as proximate the root of blade where the operating temperature is typically about 150 C. 250 C. and higher.

Silicon based electronic semiconductors such as those that may be used for transmitting data may have limited applications due to their operational temperature constraints. Temperature and performance properties of silicon and silicon on insulator SOI electronic chip technologies may limit their applications to operating environments of less than about 200 C. Aspects of the invention allow for such electronic systems to be deployed for wireless telemetry device within compressor which typically has an operating temperature of about 100 150 C.

Embodiments of wireless telemetry sensor systems may be configured to operate within higher temperature regions present in later stages of compressor and within turbine . These regions may have operating temperatures of about 150 250 C. and higher. Materials having temperature and electrical properties capable of operation in these higher temperature regions may be used for depositing sensors connectors and fabricating wireless telemetry devices .

Sensors and high temperature interconnect lines or connectors may be deposited using known deposition processes such as plasma spraying EB PVD CVD pulsed laser deposition mini plasma direct write mini HVOF or solution plasma spraying. Typically dynamic pressure measurements dynamic and static strain and dynamic acceleration measurements are desired on both stationary and rotating components of combustion turbine together with component surface temperature and heat flux measurements. Thus embedded or surface mounted sensors may be configured as strain gages thermocouples heat flux sensors pressure transducers micro accelerometers as well as other desired sensors.

Wireless telemetry device may include a board an electronic circuit an operational amplifier a modulator and an RF oscillator transmitter electrically connected with each other via interconnects . The embodiment of is an exemplary embodiment and other embodiments of device are contemplated depending on performance specifications and operating environments. Embodiments of device allow for a power source and a transmitting and receiving antenna to be fabricated on board thereby forming a transmitter such as transmitter shown in or wireless telemetry device shown in .

Antenna may be seated within recess and transmitter may be seated within recess . In this aspect antenna and transmitter are not mounted embossed or deposited onto a board . In other embodiments antenna may be deposited on a wireless telemetry board as shown in and the data may be transmitted using wireless telemetry to a receiver such as a stationary mounted transceiver . Power source may be integral with board or located separately from the board and mounted as a discrete component.

Transmitter and antenna assembly may be integrally secured with blade so that the outer mold line defined by root is not altered. For example transmitter may be affixed to a transition area or platform above the fir tree portion of root and antenna assembly may be affixed to a face of root . Alternately recesses may be formed within the platform and face so that all or a portion of transmitter and or antenna assembly are seated below the surface of the outer mold line of blade root . Transmitter and antenna assembly may be secured within respective recesses using an epoxy or adhesive and a backfill material may be place over them for protection from high temperatures or particulates.

With respect to wireless telemetry device may be affixed to blade root externally or embedded in such a way so that an outer mold line of the blade root is not significantly altered. Device may be affixed proximate blade root so that it is contained within a cavity that is created between the blade root and a rotor disk of turbine when blade root is inserted within the rotor disk. This enables a turbine blade instrumented with sensor connectors and device to be installed into a mating segment of a rotor disk of turbine in the same manner as a turbine blade that is not instrumented. In this respect instrumented blade may be manufactured having all components necessary for wirelessly extracting data indicative of various operating parameters or conditions of blade and or a barrier coating deposited thereon and transmitting that data to a receiving device.

For example one or more recesses or trenches may be formed into a portion of the substrate of blade such as blade root within which one or more wireless telemetry devices may be contained. Trenches may be formed by milling out desired regions of blade root and securing device within the trench with an epoxy or other suitable binder. The trenches may be back filled with a suitably high temperature cement or ceramic paste to protect device .

Embodiments of the present invention allow for transmitting sensor data from a rotating component such as a turbine engine blade having certain electronic components located on root of the blade which operates in an environment having a temperature of between about 300 500 C. For purposes of the disclosure herein the term high temperature without additional qualification will refer to any operating environment such as that within portions of combustion turbine having a maximum operating temperature of between about 300 500 C.

Embodiments of the present invention provide components for use in combustion turbine instrumented with telemetry systems that may include one or more sensors lead lines connecting sensors with at least one telemetry transmitter circuit at least one transmitting antenna a power source and at least one receiving antenna. illustrates turbine blade a wireless telemetry transmitter assembly and rotating antenna assembly . Lead lines or connectors may extend from one or more sensors such as sensors to telemetry transmitter assembly when mounted proximate blade root . Lead lines may route electronic data signals from sensor to telemetry transmitter assembly where the signals are processed by a telemetry transmitter circuit formed on a circuit board contained within an electronics package shown in . Lead lines or connectors may be deposited for routing electronic data signals from a telemetry transmitter circuit to rotating antenna assembly .

The telemetry transmitter assembly as best shown in may include a mounting bracket and a lid or cover plate with electronics package positioned there between. A plurality of connecting pins enable connection between an electronic circuit board contained within package such as one having a wireless telemetry circuit fabricated thereon and various external devices such as lead lines from sensors induction coil assemblies and or data transmission antennae. Mounting bracket cover plate and retention screws connecting them together may all be fabricated from the same material as is turbine blade . This ensures there is no difference in thermal expansion between turbine blade and mounting bracket . Consequently no stresses are generated in mounting bracket and or turbine blade during thermal transients.

The thermal expansion coefficient of electronics package may be less than that of mounting bracket when the operating system within which these components reside is at a high temperature. Consequently electronics package including any circuit board contained therein would expand less than mounting bracket which may lead to damage caused by vibrational energy in the system. In order to secure electronics package within mounting bracket to accommodate the dimensional change differential between bracket and electronics package a layer of ceramic fiber woven fabric may be placed between the electronic package and the inside surface of mounting bracket . Fabric may be fabricated from suitable ceramic fiber including such fibers as silicon carbide silicon nitride or aluminum oxide. For example a quantity of Nextel aluminum oxide based fabric manufactured by 3M may be used for fabric .

With electronics package and ceramic fiber woven fabric assembled with mounting bracket and cover plate to form telemetry transmitter assembly mounting bracket may be attached to turbine blade by a suitable means for attaching such as bolting welding brazing or via transient liquid phase bonding. illustrates a recess or flat pocket that may be milled or otherwise formed within turbine blade proximate blade root for receiving assembly .

Cover plate may be formed with a flange oriented perpendicular to the direction of G forces to add structural support to the cover plate which counters the G load forces occurring when rotating turbine blade is operating at full speed. This relieves retention screws from carry the load applied to cover plate via G forces and allows them to be made sufficiently small so that the telemetry transmitter assembly fits in the relatively small recess with no interference with any adjacent components. If retention screws were required to carry the load applied by the G forces their required size would be too large to fit in the available space.

Embodiments of rotatable antenna assembly may include a durable protective RF transparent cover shown in which is essentially a hollow fixture within which a data antenna and induction power components are contained. RF transparent cover protects its contents from windage and hot gas ingress during operation of combustion turbine . Certain ceramics are suitable for protecting RF transmission equipment from the elements at elevated temperatures. However many ceramics and ceramic matrix composites are prone to chipping and cracking under the vibrational impact and G loading that a rotating turbine blade experiences during operation of combustion turbine .

The inventors of the present invention have determined that RF transparent cover may be fabricated from an RF transparent high toughness structural ceramic materials. Ceramic matrix composites may be used to fabricate housing as well as material selected from a family of materials known as toughened ceramics. Materials such as silicon carbide silicon nitride zirconia and alumina are available with increased toughness due to doping with additional elements and or designed microstructures resulting from specific processing approaches.

One such material that is RF transparent easy to form and relatively inexpensive is a material selected from a ceramic family generally referred to as zirconia toughened alumina ZTA . Ceramic material selected from this family of aluminum oxide materials is considerably higher in strength and toughness than conventional pure aluminum oxide materials. This results from the stress induced transformation toughening achieved by incorporating fine zirconium oxide particles uniformly throughout the aluminum oxide. Typical zirconium oxide content is between 10 and 20 . As a result ZTA offers increased component life and performance relative to conventional pure aluminum oxide materials.

The designed microstructure of ZTA is fracture resistant when the ceramic is loaded in compression. However if loaded sufficiently in tension the ceramic will fail catastrophically as with traditional ceramic materials. Consequently RF transparent cover is designed so that the tensile stresses in the ceramic material are minimized during operation of combustion turbine . This is accomplished by designing and fabricating such that 1 all corners edges and bends of the ZTA components are machined to eliminate sharp corners and edges in order to reduce the stress concentration factor at these locations and 2 the orientation and fit of the ZTA component in a rotating antennae mounting bracket is such that during operation the G forces applied to the ZTA box do not generate significant bending stresses in the attachment flanges. This is accomplished by orienting the flanges parallel with the G loading direction rather than perpendicular to the G loading direction so the ZTA flange is loaded in compression and not in bending.

Mounting bracket may be designed so that all the G loading experienced by rotating antenna assembly during operation of combustion turbine is absorbed in a direction extending toward upper end of bracket as indicated by arrow G in . No portion of mounting bracket extends far enough past an antenna contained therein to attenuate the RF transmission data signal. RF transparent cover is secured in place so its internal stress field is primarily compressive and may be retained using threaded pins not shown through semicircular divots on its flanges.

Mounting bracket may be attached to a face of turbine blade root via conventional means such as welding brazing bonding bolting or screwing. An embodiment of rotating antenna assembly may be assembled by placing desired antennae into the hollow body of RF transparent cover feeding lead wires from the antennae out through holes formed within cover and then filling the hollow body of cover containing the antennae with a ceramic potting material. The potted RF transparent cover containing the antennae may then be slid into mounting bracket which may have been previously affixed to turbine blade root . Cover may be secured to mounting bracket via pins inserted in holes in mounting bracket and divots in cover .

Embodiments of the present invention may be powered by various means such as induced RF energy and or by harvesting thermal or vibrational power within the combustion turbine engine . In the energy harvested power model either thermoelectric or vibro electric power could be generated from the energy available in an operating combustion turbine engine . Thermopiles may be used to generate electricity from thermal energy or piezoelectric materials may generate electricity from vibration of combustion turbine engine . Examples of these forms of power sources are described in the patent application having application Ser. No. 11 516 338 filed Sep. 6 2006 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Embodiments of the present invention provide induced power modes for powering components of wireless high temperature telemetry systems. Such systems may be configured as air gap transformers where the transformer primary induction coil assembly is stationary and the secondary induction coil assembly rotates. For example an induced RF power configuration is provided for powering a rotating telemetry transmitter contained within telemetry transmitter assembly . illustrates a portion of a static seal segment such as one that may be used within the turbine engine of combustion turbine . A plurality of static seal segments may encircle turbine engine adjacent to a plurality of turbine blades . Static seal segments may cooperate with turbine blades for sealing hot gas within a hot gas path through turbine engine as recognized by those skilled in the art.

Primary induction coil assembly and data transmission antenna holder may be formed with lobes in the region of attachment to bracket . The associated regions of material in the bracket are removed in the same lobe shape with slightly larger size to accommodate installation. The lobe shape defines a radius of curvature that enables positive retention of induction coil assembly and antenna and holder which may be placed into bracket from an end and slid into position. The lobe shape enables positive retention to be maintained while simultaneously ensuring that tensile stresses are not generated in induction coil assembly and antenna holder both of which may be fabricated of relatively brittle materials subject to structural failure under tensile stresses.

The lobes may be positioned far enough from the front of induction coil assembly and data transmission antenna to ensure that metal bracket does not interfere with functionality. Ceramic cement may be applied between the surfaces of induction coil assembly and antenna holder and their respective pockets in bracket in order to provide a secure fit and accommodate thermal expansion differences during heat up and cool down. A thin plate not shown may be attached on each end of bracket that covers the lobed regions of the induction coil assembly and the data antenna ensuring retention during operation.

One or more brackets may be fabricated of the same alloy as static seal segment such as Inconel 625 and have an arcuate shape to conform to the interior surface of static seal segment . Bracket may be affixed to the interior surface of static seal segment using an interrupted weld to minimize distortion of static seal segment . Induction coil assembly may include at least one stationary core and at least one stationary primary winding with H Cement sold by JP Technologies encasing portions of stationary core .

One or more stationary primary winding may be energized by high frequency high current power sources. The power can be supplied to each stationary induction coil assembly individually or a series of stationary induction coil assemblies may be electrically connected and driven by a single power supply. In an exemplary embodiment there may be five adjacent stationary induction coil assemblies with each driven by its own power supply. The current flowing through each stationary primary winding creates a magnetic field in the rotating secondary induction coil assembly that in turn creates a current in the rotating secondary winding . The current from rotating secondary winding supplies power to a wireless telemetry transmitter circuit contained within wireless telemetry transmitter assembly as described more fully herein below.

Embodiments of induced power systems disclosed herein may employ multiple individual primary and secondary induction coil assemblies to accommodate various geometries with combustion turbine . For instance stationary induction coil assembly and data transmission primary antenna may need to span a certain distance of static seal segment in order to induce enough power to the system components and transmit the required data. An embodiment of induction coil assembly and data transmission antenna may need to be approximately four feet in length. In this example for ease of fabrication four individual power antenna assemblies each with a length of approximately one foot may be fabricated with respective brackets and installed adjacent to one another on one or more static seal segments . If the end to end gap distance between the individual antennae is sufficiently small then the antenna assembly will function as if it were a single four foot long antenna. Such antenna assemblies may be formed from straight or curved elements thereby providing assemblies of varying lengths that are straight curved or otherwise configured as required by the specific application. In an embodiment a plurality of such antenna assemblies may span an arc of approximately 112 degrees in the top half of one or more static seal segments within turbine .

The inventors of the present invention have determined that a particular class of magnetic core materials meets or exceeds the performance requirements of embodiments of the present invention. The general term for this class of materials is a nanocrystalline iron alloy. One composition of this class of material is sold under the trade name NAMGLASS and has a composition of approximately 82 iron with the balance being silicon niobium boron copper carbon nickel and molybdenum. It has been determined that such nanocrystalline iron alloy material exhibits desirable characteristics such as a Curie temperature greater than 500 C. very low coercivity low eddy current loss high saturation flux density and the permeability is very stable over the entire high temperature operating range.

This nanocrystalline iron alloy material is commercially available in tape wound configurations in the form of toroids or C core transformer cores. Embodiments of the present invention utilize this nanocrystalline iron alloy material to form an I core shape which was used for the primary stationary core . The I shape was selected because this shape holds itself in place in the channel on stationary mounting bracket . The induction core of each induction coil assembly consists of a plurality of 0.007 thick laminations of nanocrystalline iron alloy material built up into an arc of approximately eleven inches in length. The same nanocrystalline iron alloy material may be used for the rotating antenna transformer core.

The strength of the magnetic field used to couple power between the stationary and rotating elements may be increased by increasing the frequency of the driving signal i.e. the high frequency AC signal produced by an exemplary induction power driver circuit illustrated in . Thus embodiments of the present invention may employ a high frequency to drive the stationary primary windings such as frequencies greater than approximately 200 kHz. Alternate embodiments may achieve an operating frequency of at least one Mega Hertz with a power driver designed to operate at such frequencies.

The wire used for winding cores may be made of a 27 nickel clad copper with ceramic insulation in order to reduce oxidation and failure at high temperatures. The handling characteristics of this wire are significantly more challenging than standard organic insulated bare copper as a result of the protective ceramic coating and special techniques were developed for the processes of winding both the primary and rotating elements. Other wires may be insulated silver or anodized aluminum.

Two types of ceramic materials may be used in the construction of both the primary and rotating induction coil assemblies . It is important to ensure the windings do not short conduct to the core elements . In addition to ceramic insulation supplied on the wires a compound such as H cement a ceramic cement with ultra fine particle size may be used as an insulating base coat on the winding cores . Once the winding cores are wound they may be potted with Cotronics 940 an aluminum oxide based ceramic cement.

The voltage regulator of transmitter circuit maintains a constant DC voltage output even though the AC input voltage may vary. A constant voltage output is required to achieve better accuracy and stable operating frequency for the signal output. The voltage regulator also supplies a constant voltage a strain gauge sensor and a ballast resistor not shown . The strain gauge sensor and ballast resistor provide the sensor signal input to the transmitter circuit . As the surface where the strain gauge sensor is mounted deflects the strain gauge changes resistance which causes the voltage at the transmitter circuit input to change.

The varying voltage provided by the signal from the strain gauge sensor is amplified first by a differential amplifier and then by a high gain AC amplifier. The resulting signal is applied to a varactor diode in the voltage controlled oscillator VCO section of transmitter circuit . The VCO oscillates at a high carrier frequency. This carrier frequency may be set in the band of 125 to 155 MHz with respect to transmitter circuit . The fixed carrier frequency is changed slightly by the changing voltage on the varactor. This change in frequency or deviation is directly related to the deflection or strain undergone by strain gauge sensor . The VCO carrier output is fed to a buffer stage and the buffer output connects to a transmitting antenna contained in the rotating antenna assembly via lead wires of .

In a receiving device such as transceiver in or other devices located in high temperature or other areas within combustion turbine the carrier signal is removed and the deviation becomes the amplified output that is proportional to strain. The transistors used in such a transmitter circuit designed for high temperature use may be fabricated from a high temperature capable material such as wide band gap semiconductor materials including SiC AlN GaN AlGaN GaAs GaP InP AlGaAs AlGaP AlInGaP and GaAsAlN or other high temperature capable transistor material may be used up to about 500 600 C.

Various embodiments of wireless telemetry transmitter circuit fabricated on a circuit board may be adapted for use within combustion turbine at varying operating temperatures and with a range of sensor types. Elements of transmitter circuit and alternate embodiments thereof may be fabricated using various temperature sensitive materials such as silicon on insulator SOI integrated circuits up to approximately 350 C. polysilseqioxane PFA polyimide Nomex PBZT PBO PBI and Voltex wound capacitors from approximately 300 350 C. and PLZT NPO TaO BaTiOmultilayer ceramic capacitors from approximately 450 500 C.

Various embodiments of resistors may be fabricated of Ta TaN Ti SnO Ni Cr Cr Si and Pd Ag for operating environments of approximately up to 350 C. and Ru RuO Ru Ag and SiNfor operating environments of approximately 350 C. and greater. Individual high temperature electronic components such as discrete transistor diode or capacitor die made from SiC AlN GaN AlGaN GaAs GaP InP AlGaAs AlGaP AlInGaP and GaAsAlN or other high temperature capable semiconducting material may be replaced by a single SOI CMOS device for operation at temperatures not exceeding approximately 350 C.

While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein it will be obvious that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations changes and substitutions will occur to those of skill in the art without departing from the invention herein. Accordingly it is intended that the invention be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
