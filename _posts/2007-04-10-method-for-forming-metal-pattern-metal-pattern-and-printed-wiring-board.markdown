The present invention relates to a method for forming a metal pattern and a metal pattern. In particular the invention relates to a method for forming a metal pattern and a metal pattern that are useful as a metal thin film for wiring in electronic materials such as printed wiring boards and digital image display devices.

For conventional methods for forming a metal pattern mainly a subtractive method a semi additive method and a full additive method are known.

A subtractive method is a method of providing a photosensitive layer which is photosensitive to irradiation with actinic radiation on a metal layer formed on a substrate carrying out image wise light exposure and developing to form a resist image then etching the metal layer to form a metal pattern and finally separating the resist therefrom.

In substrates used with this technique in order to provide adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal layer roughening treatment is carried out to the substrate interface and adhesiveness is generated due to an anchoring effect. As a result the substrate interface portion of the completed metal film is irregular and so the high frequency characteristics thereof deteriorate when the metal film is used for electrical wiring lines. Furthermore when forming such a metal substrate a complicated process of treating the substrate with a strong acid such as chromic acid is required in order to carry out roughening treatment of the substrate.

In order to address these issues a method is proposed for minimizing the irregularities roughness of the substrate and for simplifying the treatment process of the substrate. This method involves performing surface modification by grafting a radical polymerizable compound to the substrate surface see for example Patent Document 1 and Non patent Document 1 . However expensive equipment such as a ray generator or an electron beam generator is required for this method. Moreover since the substrate used by this method is not one to which polymerization initiation groups used as the starting point of graft polymerization are introduced the graft polymer may not be generated at a sufficient level in practice. Furthermore even if the metal substrate produced by this technique is patterned using a subtractive process there are inherent problems with the subtractive method.

That is in order to form a metal pattern with extremely thin line widths using a subtractive method an over etching method is effective in which the line width after etching becomes narrower than the line width of the resist pattern itself. However when attempting to form a fine metal pattern directly by such an over etching method line smudging thin spots cracks discontinuities and the like readily occur therefore it is difficult to form metal patterns of 30 m or less from the viewpoint of forming favorable fine metal patterns. Moreover wasteful etching processes are required to remove metal thin film from areas other than the pattern portions and environmental and cost issues arise such as the expense incurred for treatment of the metal waste fluid produced by such etching processes.

In order to address the above issues a metal pattern forming technique called a semi additive method is proposed. With a semi additive method a base substrate layer of Cr or the like is thinly formed by metal plating or the like on a substrate and a resist pattern is formed on the substrate metal layer. Then after forming a metal layer of Cu or the like by metal plating on the base substrate metal layer in regions other than those of the resist pattern a wiring pattern is formed by removing the resist pattern. Thereafter the base substrate metal layer is etched using the wiring pattern as a mask and a metal pattern is formed in regions other than those of the resist pattern. Since this is an etching less technique a fine wiring pattern of 30 m or less is readily formed and this technique is effective from the environmental and cost perspectives since metal is only deposited by metal plating in the required portions. However in order to provide adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal pattern with this technique roughening treatment of the substrate surface needs to be performed and as a result the substrate interface portion of the completed metal pattern is irregular and the high frequency characteristics deteriorate when applied to electrical wiring.

Moreover a fully additive process is proposed as a metal pattern forming technique. In a fully additive process a resist pattern is formed on a substrate metal is deposited on regions other than those of the resist pattern by metal plating and the resist pattern is then removed. Since this technique is also an etching less technique a fine wiring pattern of 30 m or less is readily formed but there are the same issues as with semi additive processes.

Accordingly a new metal pattern forming technique is desired which is capable of forming a fine wiring pattern has few irregularities of the substrate interface and produces little etching waste liquid.

Moreover a fully additive process is proposed as a metal pattern forming technique.

Since this technique is also an etching less technique a fine wiring pattern of 30 m or less is readily formed but there are the same issues as with semi additive processes. Accordingly a new metal pattern forming technique is desired which is capable of forming a fine wiring pattern has few irregularities of the substrate interface and produces little etching waste liquid.

Moreover increasing the smoothness of an electric conductor surface contributes greatly to increasing density. Surface roughening is performed in conventional build up printed circuit boards in order to secure peel strength but the reality is that such irregularities of the order of several microns have become a hindrance to further micronization of wiring lines. In particular there is a problem of impairing suitability for high frequency transmission in semiconductor devices with a wiring board using a substrate to which surface roughening has been carried out.

Therefore a method is desired for forming a fine and dense metal pattern with high adhesiveness on a smooth insulating substrate for the formation of printed wiring boards applicable to semiconductor devices.

Further for fine wirings in printed wiring boards and the like a high insulating property between wirings electroconductive layers is also desired.

Accordingly there are needs for a method of forming a metal pattern which enables formation of a fine metal pattern without performing an etching process and enables formation of a metal pattern having high adherence to a substrate minor irregularities at the interface with the substrate and sufficient electric conductivity and at the same time a high insulation property in regions at which the metal pattern is not present and also for a metal pattern obtained by such a method for forming a metal pattern. Further there are needs for a printed wiring substrate that is provided with an electroconductive layer having high adherence with a substrate and that is both fine and has high density and that has at the same time excellent insulating property between the electroconductive layers.

A first aspect of the invention is to provide a method for forming a metal pattern including the steps of 

 a1 a step of providing on a substrate a polymer layer that comprises a polymer containing a functional group that interacts with a metal ion or a metal salt the polymer directly chemically bonding to the substrate

 a8 a step of performing a hydrophobilizing treatment at the polymer layer that has been provided in the step a1 and that is present in the region from which the conductive layer has been removed in the step a7 .

In the following description the method for forming a metal pattern according to the first aspect may sometimes be referred to as metal pattern forming method 1 . 

A second aspect of the invention is to provide a method for forming a metal pattern including the steps of 

 b1 a step of providing on a substrate a polymer layer that comprises a polymer containing a functional group that interacts with a metal colloid the polymer directly chemically bonding to the substrate 

 b2 a step of applying a metal colloid to the polymer layer to form a conductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square

 b7 a step of performing a hydrophobilizing treatment at the polymer layer that has been provided in the step b1 and is present in the region from which the conductive layer has been removed in the step b6 .

In the following description the method for forming a metal pattern of the second aspect may sometimes be referred to as metal pattern forming method 2 . 

A third aspect of the invention provides a metal pattern obtained by the method for forming a metal pattern of the aspect 1 or 2 of the invention.

A fourth aspect of the invention provides a printed wiring board provided with the metal pattern of the third aspect of the invention as an electroconductive layer.

A substrate in the present invention refers to something with a surface to which a polymer is able to directly chemically bond. For example when chemically bonding a polymer directly to a resin film the term substrate refers to the resin film itself and when an intermediate layer such as a polymerization initiation layer is provided on a surface of a base material such as a resin film and a polymer is chemically bonded directly to this surface then the term substrate refers to the film base material and the polymerization initiation layer provided therewith.

In the following a functional group that interacts with a metal ion a metal salt or a metal colloid may be referred to as an interactive group for convenience.

The metal pattern obtained with the metal pattern forming method of the present invention is preferably a metal pattern that is provided on a substrate having surface irregularities of no more than 500 nm and the adhesiveness of such a metal pattern to such a substrate is preferably 0.2 kN m or more.

By using a substrate with surface irregularities no more than 500 nm the surface irregularities of a polymer layer formed thereon also becomes no more than 500 nm. By performing electroplating after applying a metal ion or a metal salt to such a polymer layer and reducing it or after applying a metal colloid thereto a state is achieved where the metal used in the metal plating penetrates into the polymer layer a composite state and further the metal plating film is formed on the polymer layer. Consequently the roughness of the interface of the thus formed metal pattern and the substrate the interface of the metal with the polymer layer organic component becomes slightly rougher due to the plating metal penetrated into the polymer pattern in comparison to the roughness of the surface of the polymer pattern. However since this increase in roughness is only by a minor amount the irregularities at the interface of the metal plating layer inorganic component with the polymer layer organic component of a metal pattern may be suppressed to the extent that the high frequency characteristics of the metal pattern do not deteriorate. Therefore when using such a metal pattern for electrical wiring superior high frequency characteristics may be obtained. High frequency characteristics are characteristics of reduction in transmission loss during high frequency power transmission and in particular characteristics of reduction in conductor loss.

After detailed investigations into the polymer layer organic component which is present between such a metal pattern and a substrate the polymer layer which is present between the metal pattern and the substrate is found to have a portion containing particles of a metal which has been deposited by electroplating at 25 by volume or more thereof to a thickness of 0.05 m or more in a direction from the interface of the substrate and the metal pattern and it is thought that the presence of these particles of metal or the like provides a composite state that is beneficial to the adhesiveness of the metal pattern.

Here by reducing the irregularities of the substrate surface the roughness of the substrate interface portion with the metal pattern may be further suppressed and the high frequency characteristics of the obtained metal pattern may be improved. In view of this a substrate with surface irregularities of 100 nm or less is preferably used.

In addition the substrate surface of the metal pattern portion obtained by the invention has the substrate interface with a minimized surface irregularity by modifying the surface through surface grafting and that the substrate interface of metal portion is in a hybrid state with the graft polymer that is directly connected to the substrate. Thereby it is considered that adhesiveness between the formed metal film and the substrate is high.

In the present invention Rz according to JIS B0601 is used as the standard for surface roughness namely the difference between the average of the Z data from the maximum peak to the fifth highest peak and the average of the Z data from the minimum valley to the fifth lowest valley .

When the metal pattern obtained with the application of the present invention is used as a conductive material such as in a wiring board the less the irregularities at the interface of the formed metal pattern i.e. the interface of wiring metal portions with the organic material are the less the power loss during high frequency power transmission transmission loss becomes.

Further the method for forming a metal pattern of the invention is characterized by performing after the formation of the metal pattern a hydrophobilizing treatment at the polymer layer exposed in a region in which no metal pattern is present. As the result of such hydrophobilizing treatment the metal pattern obtained by the invention has an improved insulating property in the region where no metal pattern is present. Therefore when the metal pattern is applied to wiring in various electronic materials wirings having high reliability without the occurrence of short circuit in despite of fine wirings can be obtained.

As described above when the metal pattern obtained by applying the invention is used as wiring portions in printed wiring boards and the like a fine and dense wiring having an excellent planarity and close adherence with the substrate is formed to result in at the same time one that has a sufficient electric conductivity excellent insulating property between wirings and also excellent high frequency characteristics.

The present invention can provide a method of forming a metal pattern which enables formation of a metal pattern having high adherence to a substrate minor irregularities at the interface with the substrate and sufficient electric conductivity and at the same time a high insulation property in regions at which the metal pattern is not present and also for a metal pattern obtained by such a method for forming a metal pattern. Further the present invention can provide a printed wiring substrate that is provided with an electroconductive layer having high adherence with a substrate and that is both fine and has high density and that has at the same time excellent insulating property between the electroconductive layers.

 a1 a step of providing on a substrate a polymer layer that comprises a polymer containing a functional group that interacts with a metal ion or a metal salt the polymer directly chemically bonding to the substrate 

 a3 a step of reducing the metal ion or the metal salt to form a conductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square 

 a4 a step of forming a pattern shaped resist layer on the conductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square

 a5 a step of forming in a region where the resist layer is not formed a metal pattern by electroplating 

 a7 a step of removing the conductive layer formed in the step a3 from the region that has been protected by the resist layer and

 a8 a step of performing a hydrophobilizing treatment to the polymer layer that has been provided in the step a1 and exists in the region from which the conductive layer has been removed in the step a7 .

In the step a1 a polymer layer is provided on a substrate the polymer layer including a polymer containing a functional group an interactive group that interacts with a metal ion or a metal salt and directly chemically bonding to the substrate.

The step a1 preferably includes a step a1 1 of preparing a substrate having a polymerization initiation layer containing a polymerization initiator formed on a base material and a step a1 2 of providing on the polymerization initiation layer that has been formed on the substrate a polymer layer including a polymer containing an interactive group and is directly chemically bonding to the base material.

In the step a1 2 it is preferable that the polymer is directly chemically bonded to the entire surface of the substrate by contacting a polymer containing a polymerizable group and an interactive group with the polymerization initiation layer formed on the substrate and then applying energy thereto.

Formation of the polymer layer on the substrate is performed by a general technique called surface graft polymerization. The graft polymerization method includes applying an active species to a polymer compound chain and further polymerizing another monomer thereto that initiates polymerization with the active species thereby synthesizing a graft polymer. Specifically this polymerization is called surface graft polymerization when the polymer compound to which the active species is applied forms a surface of a solid body.

Any known methods described in publications can be applied as the surface graft polymerization method of the present invention. For example a photo graft polymerization method and a plasma irradiation graft polymerization method are described as surface graft polymerization methods at page 135 of Shin Kobunshi Jikken gaku New Polymer Experimentology 10 edited by the Society of Polymer Science Japan published in 1994 by Kyoritsu Shuppan Co. Ltd. There are also radiation irradiation graft polymerization methods such as using rays or an electron beam described at pages 203 and 695 of Kyuchaku Gijutsu Binran Handbook of Adsorption Technology under the editorial supervision of Takeuchi published by NTS Inc. February 1999. Specific methods of photo graft polymerization which may be used include the methods described in JP A No. 63 92658 JP A No. 10 296895 and JP A No. 11 119413.

As techniques for producing a polymer layer directly chemically bonding at the terminals of the polymer compound chains in addition to the above methods a method can also be applied in which reactive functional groups such as a trialkoxysilyl group an isocyanate group an amino group a hydroxyl group or a carboxyl group are provided to a terminal end of a polymer compound chain and a coupling reaction of these groups and functional groups present on the substrate surface to form a polymer layer. A photo graft polymerization method is preferable from the standpoint of generating more surface graft polymers.

The substrate of the present invention has a surface having a functionality such that a terminal end of a polymer compound containing an interactive group is able to directly or via a trunk polymer compound chemically bond thereto. A base material itself may have such a surface property or a separate intermediate layer may be provided on such a base material or the intermediate layer may have such characteristics

As a technique for producing a surface to which the terminal end of a chain of a polymer compound containing an interactive group is chemically bonded via a trunk polymer compound there is a method including synthesizing a polymer compound containing an interactive group and a functional group capable of carrying out a coupling reaction with a functional group at the substrate surface and forming the surface by the coupling reaction of this polymer compound and the functional group at the substrate surface. There is another method including when the substrate surface has a property of generating a radical species synthesizing a polymer compound containing a polymerizable group and an interactive group applying this polymer compound onto the substrate interface generating the radical species and causing a polymerization reaction of the substrate surface with the polymer compound to form the surface.

In the present invention an active species is applied to a substrate surface as described above and a graft polymer is generated starting from the active species. When generating the graft polymer it is preferable to form a polymerization initiation layer containing a polymerization initiator on the substrate step a 1 from a standpoint of efficiently generating active sites to generate more surface graft polymers.

The polymerization initiation layer is preferably formed as a layer containing a polymerizable compound and a polymerization initiator.

The polymerization initiation layer of the present invention may be formed by dissolving the essential components in a solvent in which they are soluble disposing the solution on a substrate surface by a method such as coating and curing the film by heating or light irradiation thereon.

There are no particular limitations to the polymerizable compound used for the polymerization initiation layer as long as it has good adhesiveness to a base material and as long as a surface graft polymer is generated by the application of energy thereto such as by actinic radiation irradiation. Polyfunctional monomers and the like may be used but a particularly preferable embodiment is one using a hydrophobic polymer containing a polymerizable group within its molecule.

Specific examples of such a hydrophobic polymer include diene containing homopolymers such as polybutadiene polyisoprene and polypentadiene and allyl group containing homopolymers such as allyl meth acrylate and 2 allyloxyethyl methacrylate binary or multicomponent copolymers which include as a structural unit a diene containing monomer such as butadiene isoprene pentadiene and the like or an allyl group containing monomer such as styrene meth acrylate and meth acrylonitrile and linear or three dimensional copolymers that have a carbon carbon double bond within their molecules such as an unsaturated polyester an unsaturated polyepoxide an unsaturated polyamide an unsaturated polyacrylate a high density polyethylene and the like

It should be noted that in this specification when referring to acrylic and or methacrylic this is sometimes written as meth acrylic .

The amount contained of the polymerizable compound in the polymerization initiation layer is preferably in the range of from 0 mass to 100 mass in terms of solid content and the range from 10 mass to 80 mass is particularly preferable.

A polymerization initiator for exhibiting a polymerization initiation ability with energy application is included in the polymerization initiation layer. Such a polymerization initiator may be suitably selected according to the application from known thermal polymerization initiators photo polymerization initiators and the like which exhibit a polymerization initiation ability with application of certain energy thereto for example irradiation of actinic radiation heating irradiation of an electron beam and the like. A photopolymerization initiator is preferably employed from among these since photopolymerization is preferable from the standpoint of manufacturability.

There is no particular limitation to the photopolymerization initiator as long as it is active in the irradiated actinic radiation and is capable of surface graft polymerization. For example a radical polymerization initiator an anionic polymerization initiator a cationic polymerization initiator and the like may be used. Among these a radical polymerization initiator is preferable from the standpoint of reactivity.

Specific examples of such a photopolymerization initiator include for example acetophenones such as p tert butyltrichloroacetophenone 2 2 diethoxyacetophenone and 2 hydroxy 2 methyl 1 phenyl propan 1 one ketones such as benzophenone 4 4 bisdimethylaminobenzophenone 2 chlorothioxantone 2 methylthioxantone 2 ethylthioxantone and 2 isopropylthioxantone benzoin ethers such as benzoin benzoin methyl ether benzoin isopropyl ether and benzoin isobutyl ether benzyl ketals such as benzyl dimethyl ketal and hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and the like

The amount contained of the polymerization initiator in the polymerization initiation layer is preferably in the range of from 0.1 mass to 70 mass in terms of solid content and the range from 1 mass to 40 mass is particularly preferable.

There is no particular limitation to the solvent used for coating a polymerizable compound and a polymerization initiator as long as it dissolves these components therein. A solvent whose boiling point is not too high is preferable from the standpoints of ease of drying and workability and specifically a solvent with a boiling point of from about 40 C. to about 150 C. may be selected.

Specific examples of the solvent include acetone methyl ethyl ketone cyclohexane ethyl acetate tetrahydrofuran toluene ethylene glycol monomethyl ether ethylene glycol monoethyl ether ethylene glycol dimethyl ether propylene glycol monomethyl ether propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetylacetone cyclohexanone methanol ethanol 1 methoxy 2 propanol 3 methoxypropanol diethylene glycol monomethyl ether diethylene glycol monoethyl ether diethylene glycol dimethyl ether diethylene glycol diethylether propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate 3 methoxypropyl acetate and the like.

These solvents may be used singly or as mixtures thereof. A solid concentration of from 2 to 50 mass is suitable for the coating liquid.

The coating amount when forming a polymerization initiation layer on a substrate is preferably from 0.1 g mto 20 g mdry weight and more preferably from 1 g mto 15 g m from the standpoints of exhibiting sufficient polymerization initiation ability maintaining a film property and preventing the film from peeling.

When forming a polymerization initiation layer in the present invention as described above the composition for the above polymerization initiation layer formation is disposed by coating or the like on the surface of a base material and then the solvent is removed to form a film. When this is carried out it is preferable to cure the film by performing heating and or light irradiation. It is particularly preferable to carry out a certain amount of curing of the polymerizable compound in advance by pre curing by light irradiation after drying with heat since the occurrences of the whole polymerization initiation layer falling off after grafting may be effectively suppressed thereby. The rational for using light irradiation for pre curing is similar to that described for the aforementioned photo polymerization initiator.

Conditions of heating temperature and time may be selected so that there is sufficient drying of the coating liquid however a temperature of 100 C. or less for a time period of 30 minutes or less is preferable from the standpoint of applicability to production with drying conditions of a drying temperature in the range of 40 C. to 80 C. and a drying time of 10 minute or less being more preferable.

After heating and drying a light source used for the later described grafting reaction may be used for light irradiation that is optionally performed. Preferably the light irradiation is performed to the extent that complete radical polymerization is not carried out while the polymerizable compound present in the polymerization initiation layer is partially radical polymerized from the standpoint of not impeding formation of a bond between the active sites of the polymerization initiation layer and the graft chain that is carried out by applying energy during the subsequent grafting reaction. The light irradiation duration depends on the strength of the light source but it is generally preferably 30 minutes or less. As a rough guide to such pre curing the amount may be such that the residual film proportion after washing out the solvent is 10 or less and the proportion of the initiator remaining after pre curing is 1 or more.

The base material used for the present invention is preferably a dimensionally stable plate shaped member and examples include for example paper plastic for example polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene and the like laminated paper a metal plate for example aluminum zinc copper and the like plastic films for example cellulose diacetate cellulose triacetate cellulose propionate cellulose butyrate cellulose acetate butyrate cellulose nitrate polyethylene terephthalate polyethylene polystyrene polypropylene polycarbonate polyvinyl acetal polyimide epoxy and the like paper plastic films and the like with a metal laminated or vapor deposited thereon. A polyester film or a polyimide film is preferable as the base material used for the present invention.

The metal pattern obtained by the present invention can be applied to semiconductor packages various electric wiring substrates and the like. When it is used for such applications insulating resins as shown below are preferably used as the substrate.

Examples of such an insulating resin include resins such as polyphenylene ethers or modified polyphenylene ethers cyanate ester compounds and epoxy compounds. A substrate formed with a thermosetting resin composition containing one or more sorts of such resins is preferably used. When using such resins in combinations of two or more as a resin composition preferable combinations include polyphenylene ether or modified polyphenylene ether with a cyanate ester compound polyphenylene ether or modified polyphenylene ether with an epoxy compound and polyphenylene ether or modified polyphenylene ether with a cyanate ester compound and an epoxy compound.

When forming a substrate with such a thermosetting resin composition inorganic fillers chosen from the group which includes silica talc aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide are preferably not included therein and a thermosetting resin composition which includes a bromine compound or a phosphorus compound is preferable.

Moreover other insulating resins include 1 2 bis vinylphenylene ethane resin or a modified resin of 1 2 bis vinylphenylene ethane resin with a polyphenylene ether resin. Such resins are described in detail for example in pages 1252 to 1258 of the 92nd volume of Journal of Applied Polymer Science 2004 by Satoru AMOU.

Furthermore preferable examples include commercially available liquid crystal polymers with a representative example thereof being VECSTAR trade name made by Kuraray Co. Ltd. and fluororesins and the like with a representative example thereof being polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE .

Among such resins fluororesins PTFE have the most excellent high frequency characteristics of polymer materials. However since they are thermoplastic resins with a low Tg they have poor dimensional stability to heat and the mechanical strength and the like thereof is inferior to those of thermosetting resin materials. Further they also have inferior molding and processing characteristics. Moreover thermoplastic resins such as polyphenylene ether PPE may also be used after alloying with a thermosetting resin and the like. Examples that may be used include an alloyed resin of PPE with an epoxy resin or triarylisocyanate or an alloyed resin of a PPE resin into which a polymerizable functional group has been introduced with another thermosetting resin.

Although dielectric characteristics of an epoxy resin are insufficient as they are improvements have been achieved by introducing a bulky skeleton or the like. In this way a resin is preferably used which takes advantage of the different characteristics from other resins to compensate for any deficiencies thereof by introducing such a structure or by carrying out modification or the like. For example although a cyanate ester is a thermosetting resin which has the most excellent dielectric characteristics among the thermosetting resins it is rarely used on its own and is more normally used as a modified resin such as with an epoxy resin a maleimide resin or a thermoplastic resin. Details relating to such matters are described at page 35 of Denshi Gijutsu Electronic Technology No. 9 2002 and one of these resins or a similar insulating resin may be chosen with reference thereto.

When applying the metal pattern obtained by the present invention to a semiconductor package or to various electrical wiring applications and the like it is effective to provide a low dielectric constant and a low dielectric tangent to the substrate from the standpoint of carrying out mass data processing at high speed and in order to suppress delay and attenuation of signals. Details regarding the materials having a low dielectric tangent are described at page 397 of Electronics Jissou Gakkaishi Electronics Packaging Institution Journal volume 7 No. 5 2004 . It is particularly preferable to adopt an insulating material having low dielectric tangent characteristics from a standpoint of improvements in speed.

Specifically a substrate which includes an insulating resin whose dielectric constant relative dielectric constant at 1 GHz is 3.5 or less or a substrate having a layer containing an insulating resin on a base material is preferably used as the substrate for such applications. Moreover it is preferable that the substrate is one formed from an insulating resin whose dielectric tangent at 1 GHz is 0.01 or less or is a substrate which has a layer containing such an insulating resin on a base material.

The dielectric constant and the dielectric tangent of such insulating resins can be measured using a conventional method. For example these characteristics can be measured according to the methods described at page 189 of Collection of Extracts of the 18th Institute of Electronics Packaging Institution Convention 2004 using a cavity resonator perturbation method for example an instrument for measuring r and tan of a ultra thin sheet made by KEYCOM Corp. .

Thus an insulating resin material may also be suitably selected for the present invention from standpoints of dielectric constant and dielectric tangent. Examples of insulating resins with a dielectric constant of 3.5 or less and a dielectric tangent of 0.01 or less include a liquid crystal polymer a polyimide resin a fluororesin a polyphenylene ether resin a cyanate ester resin a bis bisphenylene ethane resin modified resins thereof and the like.

The irregularities on the surface of the base material applied to the metal pattern forming method of the present invention are preferably 500 nm or less more preferably 200 nm or less still more preferably 50 nm or less and most preferably 20 nm or less.

Furthermore the Rz ten point average roughness of the surface of the base material is preferably 500 nm or less more preferably 100 nm or less still more preferably 50 nm or less and most preferably 20 nm or less. It should be noted that the measuring method of Rz is the measurement undertaken according to JIS B0601 of the difference between the average of the Z data from the maximum peak to the fifth highest peak and the average of the Z data from the minimum valley to the fifth lowest valley .

As generation modes of the graft polymer in the step a1 as described above a method of using a coupling reaction between a functional group present on the substrate surface and a reactive functional group at a terminal end or side chain of a polymer compound and a method of carrying out direct photo graft polymerization of the substrate may be used.

In the present invention preferred is a mode step a1 2 including introducing a polymer containing a functional group an interactive group which interacts with an electroless plating catalyst or a precursor thereof and that directly chemically bonds to the base material onto the substrate on which the polymerization initiation layer has been formed. Further preferred is a mode in which after contacting the polymer containing a polymerizable group and an interactive group with the base material on which the polymerization initiation layer has been formed the polymer is directly chemically bonded to the entire substrate of the base material by applying energy thereto. That is to say a composition containing the compound containing a polymerizable group and an interactive group is contacted with the polymerization initiation layer formed on the base material surface and directly bonded to the base material surface by the active species generated on the base material surface.

The above contact may be performed by immersing a base material in a liquid state composition including the compound containing a polymerizable group and an interactive group. However as described later a layer containing a composition including a compound polymerizable group and an interactive group as a main component may be formed on a substrate surface by an application method from standpoints of handling and manufacturing efficiency.

In the present invention any reactions may be applied as coupling reactions for generation of a graft polymer. Specific combinations of a functional groups on the substrate surface and a reactive functional group at a terminal end or side chain of the polymer compound include combinations of COOH amine COOH aziridine COOH isocyanate COOH epoxy NH isocyanate NH aldehydes OH alcohol OH halogenated compound OH amine and OH acid anhydride . The combinations OH polyvalent isocyanate and OH epoxy are particularly preferable from a standpoint of high reactivity.

In the method of carrying out direct photo graft polymerization to the substrate according to the present invention the following monomers may be used as a compound having an interactive group and capability of directly chemically bonding to the substrate when generating the graft polymer. Examples thereof include monomers which have functional groups such as a carboxyl group a sulfonic group a phosphoric group an amino group or salts thereof a hydroxyl group an amide group a phosphine group an imidazole group a pyridine group or salts thereof or an ether group for example meth acrylic acid or an alkali metal salt or amine salt thereof itaconic acid or an alkali metal salt or amine salt thereof 2 hydroxyethyl meth acrylate meth acrylamide N monomethylol meth acrylamide N dimethylol meth acrylamide allylamine or a hydrohalic acid salt thereof 3 vinylpropionic acid or an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof vinylsulfonic acid or an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof 2 sulfoethyl meth acrylate polyoxyethyleneglycol mono meth acrylate 2 acrylamide 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid acid phosphooxy polyoxyethyleneglycol mono metha acrylate and N vinyl pyrrolidone structure as shown below . These monomers may be used singly on their own or in combinations of two or more thereof.

Examples of a polymer that contains an interactive group and that directly chemically bonds to the substrate include polymers generated from a monomer containing an interactive group. Moreover a preferably used polymer is a polymer containing a polymerizable group and an interactive group i.e. a homopolymer or copolymer obtained using at least one monomer with an interactive group into which an ethylene addition polymerizable unsaturated group polymerizable group such as a vinyl group an allyl group and a meth acrylic group is introduced as the polymerizable group. Such a polymer containing a polymerizable group and an interactive group has a polymerizable group at least at a terminal end or side chain thereof wherein the polymerizable group is preferably present at a terminal end and is more preferably present at both of a terminal end and at a side chain.

In the present invention the reason that a polymer containing a polymerizable group and an interactive group is preferably used is as follows. Namely performing graft polymerization with a monomer using a method of immersing in a monomer solution is difficult to be used for mass production considering manufacturability. Moreover in a method of coating a monomer solution it is especially difficult to maintain uniformity of the monomer solution on a base material up till light irradiation. Furthermore although a method is known of after coating a monomer solution covering with a film or the like it is difficult to carry out such covering uniformly and the covering operation itself becomes necessary leading to a complicated operation. However in contrast if a polymer is used it becomes solid after being applied and therefore a uniform film can be formed and mass production is facilitated.

The following monomers may be used as a monomer containing an interactive group for synthesizing the above polymer. Examples thereof include monomers which have functional groups such as a carboxyl group a sulfonic group a phosphoric group an amino group or salts thereof a hydroxyl group an amide group a phosphine group an imidazole group a pyridine group or salts thereof or an ether group for example meth acrylic acid or an alkali metal salt or amine salt thereof itaconic acid or an alkali metal salt or amine salt thereof 2 hydroxyethyl meth acrylate meth acrylamide N monomethylol meth acrylamide N dimethylol meth acrylamide allylamine or a hydrohalic acid salt thereof 3 vinylpropionic acid or an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof vinylsulfonic acid or an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof 2 sulfoethyl meth acrylate polyoxyethyleneglycol mono meth acrylate 2 acrylamide 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid acid phosphooxy polyoxyethyleneglycol mono metha acrylate and N vinylpyrrolidone structure as shown below . These monomers may be used singly on their own or in combinations of two or more thereof.

The polymer layer graft polymer layer which includes a polymer containing an interactive group may be formed on a base material according to the step a1 as explained above.

In the step a2 a metal ion or a metal salt is applied to the polymer layer formed in the step a1 . In this step the interactive group of the graft polymer configuring the polymer layer adheres adsorbs the applied metal ions or metal salts according to the function of the interactive group.

There are no particular limitation to the metal salt as long as it dissolves in a solvent suitable for applying to the polymer layer and as long as it dissociates to a metal ion and a base anion and preferable examples of such a metal salt include M NO n MCln M SO and M PO wherein M represents a n valent metal atom .

The metal ion or the metal salt in the present invention are preferably a metal ion or a metal salt of a metal selected from the group consisting of copper silver gold nickel and chromium from the standpoints of the reduced metal not being readily oxidized and being suitable as an electrical material.

The method used for applying the metal ion or the metal salt may be suitably selected in consideration of the compound forming the graft polymer configuring the polymer layer. Moreover the graft polymer preferably contains a hydrophilic group from the standpoint of adhesion of metal ions and the like. As the hydrophilic group specifically a carboxyl group a sulfonyl group and a hydroxyl group are preferable.

In particular according to the above method iii properties of the graft polymer is not particularly limited and desired metal ion or metal salt may be applied thereto.

In the application of the metal ion or the metal salt to a polymer layer when the above method i of allowing the metal ion to be adsorbed to the ionic group of the graft polymer is used the above metal salts may be dissolved in a suitable solvent and the resultant solution containing the dissociated metal ions may be applied onto a substrate surface that has been formed with a polymer layer or the substrate formed with the polymer layer may be immersed in such a solution. By contacting the solution containing the metal ions the metal ions can be adsorbed to the ionic groups. From a standpoint of carrying out sufficient adsorption it is preferable that the concentration of the metal ion or metal salt in the solution is in the range from 1 to 50 mass and the range from 10 to 30 mass is more preferable. Moreover the contact time is preferably from about 10 seconds to 24 hours and is more preferably from about 1 minute to 180 minutes.

In the application of the metal ion or the metal salt to a polymer layer when ii the graft polymer is a polymer having high affinity to a metal salt such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone the metal salt may be attached directly to the polymer layer in the form of microparticles or may be applied by coating or immersing a substrate surface having the polymer layer thereon with a solution containing dissociated metal ions obtained by dissolving the metal salt with a suitable solvent.

The metal salt concentration of the dispersion liquid or metal salt concentration is preferably in the range of from 1 to 50 mass and is still more preferably in the range of from 10 to 30 mass from a standpoint of ensuring sufficient impregnation with the dispersion. Moreover the contact time is preferably from about 10 seconds to 24 hours and is more preferably about 1 minute to 180 minutes.

In application of the metal ion or the metal salt to the graft polymer when employing method iii of immersing a glass substrate having a polymer layer of a hydrophilic graft polymer in a liquid containing the metal salt or in a solution in which the metal salt is dissolved and impregnating the polymer layer with the metal ions and or the liquid containing the metal salt the metal salt can be applied by preparing a dispersion of the metal salt using a suitable solvent or preparing a solution of the dissociated metal ions and applying the dispersion or solution to a substrate surface having the polymer layer or immersing the substrate in the dispersion or solution.

Moreover the contact time is preferably from about 10 seconds to 24 hours and is more preferably about 1 minute to 180 minutes.

 Relationship Between the Polarity of the Functional Group of the Graft Polymer and the Metal Ion or Metal Salt 

When the graft polymer has a functional group having a negative charge a region on which a simple element of metal metal film or metal microparticles is deposited can be formed by allowing metal ions having a positive charge to be adsorbed to the functional groups having a negative charge and then reducing the adsorbed metal ions.

 Relationship Between the Polarity of a Hydrophilic Group of a Hydrophilic Compound Bonding Type and the Metal Ion or Metal Salt 

When the graft polymer has as explained above an anionic group such as a carboxyl group a sulfonic group or a phosphonic acid group as a hydrophilic functional group the graft polymer can be selectively negatively charged and a metal particle film region wiring can be formed by allowing metal ions having a positive charge to be adsorbed to the functional groups and then reducing the adsorbed metal ions.

On the other hand when the graft polymer chain has a cationic group such as an ammonium group like those described in JP A No. 10 296895 the polymer is selectively positively charged and a metal particle film region wiring can be formed by impregnating the graft polymer with a solution containing the metal salt or a solution dissolving the metal salt and then reducing the metal ions in the solution or in the metal salts. Such metal ions are preferably bonded to the hydrophilic groups of the hydrophilic surface at an amount of as much as possible from the standpoint of durability of bonding.

Methods for applying the metal ions to the hydrophilic groups include a method of coating a solution in which metal ions or a metal salt has been dissolved or dispersed onto a support surface and a method of immersing a support surface into such a solution or dispersion. In either way of coating and immersion an excessive quantity of metal ions are supplied and the contact duration is preferably from about 10 seconds to about 24 hours and is still more preferably from about 1 minute to about 180 minutes so that sufficient ionic bonding with the hydrophilic groups is introduced.

The metal ions or the metal salt may be used singly or in combination of two or more. Moreover in order to achieve desired conductivity plural materials may be used by mixing in advance.

In a conductive layer formed by the below mentioned processes it may be confirmed by surface observations and cross section observations using an SEM and AFM that the metal particles are dispersed compactly at the surface graft film. The particle sizes of the metal particles formed are from about 1 nm to 1 m.

In the step a3 the metal ion or metal salt applied to the polymer layer in the step a2 above is reduced thereby forming a conductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square.

In the present step the metal salt or metal ion that has been adsorbed to or impregnated in the graft polymer is reduced. The reducing agent used to form the conductive layer is not particularly limited as long as it has a property of reducing the metal salt compound that has been used to allow the metal to separate out and examples thereof include a hypophosphite salt a tetrahydroboric acid salt hydrazine and the like.

The reducing agent is suitably chosen according to their relationship with the metal salt or metal ion used. The reducing agent is preferably sodium tetrahydroborate when an aqueous solution of silver nitrate or the like is used as an aqueous metal salt solution for supplying metal ions or metal salt and is preferably hydrazine when an aqueous solution of palladium dichloride is used.

Examples of the addition method of the above reducing agent include for example a method of applying metal ions or metal salt to a substrate surface which has a polymer layer thereon washing with water and removing excess metal salt or metal ions then immersing the substrate in ion exchange water or the like and adding a reducing agent thereto and a method of directly coating or dripping an aqueous solution containing the reducing agent at a given concentration onto such a substrate surface. An excess quantity of the reducing agent i.e. more than the equivalent amount to the metal ions is preferably used as the addition amount thereof and it is still more preferable that the addition amount is more than 10 times the equivalent amount.

The presence of a uniform high strength conductive layer due to the addition of the reducing agent may be checked with the naked eye from a metallic luster of the surface and the structure thereof may be checked by observing the surface using a transmission electron microscope or an AFM atomic force microscope . Moreover the film thickness of the metal particles film may be readily measured by a conventional method such as for example observation of a cut face with an electron microscope.

In the step a3 it is also preferable to provide a conductive layer having a surface resistivity of 5 square to 100 k square by applying an electroless plating liquid to the polymer layer to which the metal ion or metal salt has been applied reducing the metal ion or metal salt to the metal and at the same time performing electroless plating while using the metal as an electroless plating catalyst.

An electroless plating means such operation as depositing metal through a chemical reaction while using a solution dissolving a metal ion to be plated.

The application of the electroless plating liquid in the step a3 can be preferably performed for example by providing the polymer layer with the metal ion or metal salt in the step a2 subsequently washing with water to remove excessive metal salts and the like and dipping the resulting product in an electroless plating bath containing a metal ion to be plated and a surface charge controlling agent. For other components than the surface charge controlling agent usable as the electroless plating bath generally known electroless plating baths may be used.

The composition of general electroless plating bath mainly includes 1. a metal ion to be plated 2. a reducing agent and 3. an additive for improving the stability of the metal ion stabilizer . In the present step 4. a surface charge controlling agent is further contained. In addition to these the plating bath may contain a publicly known additives such as a stabilizer of the plating bath and the like.

Copper tin lead nickel gold palladium and rhodium are known as the metal for use in the electroless plating bath. Among these from the standpoint of the electric conductivity copper and gold are particularly preferable.

In addition there are optimum reducing agents and additives corresponding to the aforementioned metals. For example an electroless plating bath of copper contains Cu SO as a copper salt HCOH as an reducing agent and a chelating agent such as EDTA and Rochelle salt being a stabilizer for copper ions as an additive. An electroless plating bath for use in electroless plating of CoNiP contains cobalt sulfate and nickel sulfate as a metal salt sodium hypophosphite as a reducing agent and sodium malonate sodium malate and sodium succinate as a chelating agent. An electroless plating bath of palladium contains Pd NH Clas an metal ion NHand HNNHas a reducing agent and EDTA as a stabilizer. These plating baths may contain a component other than the aforementioned components.

In the step a4 a pattern shaped resist layer is formed on the conductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square formed in the step a3 .

Such a resist layer may be formed using a photosensitive resist. Photosensitive resists which may be used include photo curable negative working resists and photo dissolution positive working resists that are dissolved by light exposure.

Examples of photosensitive resists which may be used include 1. photosensitive dry film resists DFR 2. liquid resists and 3. ED electrodeposition resists. These each have their own respective characteristics. Namely the photosensitive dry film resists DFR may be used dry and so their handling is simple. The liquid resists may be made into thin film thickness resists and so are capable of making patterns with good resolution. The ED electrodeposition resists may be made into thin film thickness resists and so are capable of making patterns with good resolution and their following characteristics to irregularities on the coating surface are good and adhesiveness is excellent. The photosensitive resist to be used may be selected in consideration of such characteristics.

When using each of above respective photosensitive resists the resist may be disposed on the conductive layer formed in the step a3 in the following manner.

A photosensitive dry film generally is sandwiched between a polyester film and a polyethylene film and is pressure applied by pressing with a hot roll while releasing the polyethylene film by a laminator.

Formulation film production methods and laminating methods of photosensitive dry film resists are described in detail in the specification of JP A No. 2006 284842 at paragraph numbers 0192 to 0372 submitted previously by the present applicant and the descriptions therein may also be applied in a similar manner in the present invention.

Coating methods include spray coating roll coating curtain coating and dip coating. For coating both sides at the same time roll coating and dip coating are preferable from these methods since coating both sides at the same time is possible thereby.

Liquid resists are described in detail in the specification of JP A No. 2007 010785 at paragraph numbers 0199 to 0219 submitted previously by the present applicant and the descriptions therein may also be applied in a similar manner in the present invention.

ED resists are colloid products formed by suspending fine particles of photosensitive resist in water and since the particles are charged when a voltage is applied to the conductor layer a resist deposits by electrophoresis on the conductor layer and the colloid bond with each other on the conductor to form a film and a coating may be formed.

In pattern light exposure the base material formed with the resist film on the upper portion of the metal film is adhered to a mask film or a dry plate and exposed to light in the light sensitive region of the resist used. When using a film the film may be adhered in a vacuum baking frame and exposed. The source of light exposure may be a point light source if the pattern width is about 100 m. When forming patterns of widths of 100 m or less a parallel light source is preferably used.

Any substance may be used for development as long as it can dissolve unexposed portions when the resist is a photo curable negative working type or exposed portions when the resist is a photo dissolution positive working type which dissolves by light exposure. However organic solvents and alkali aqueous solutions are mainly used and alkali aqueous solutions are preferably used from a standpoint of environmental impact reduction.

In the step a5 subsequently to the step a4 a metal pattern is formed by electroplating on the region where the resist layer is not formed. Namely at this step by using as a base the conductive layer formed in step a3 and by further performing electroplating a pattern shaped conductive layer is formed with excellent adhesiveness to a substrate provided with sufficient conductivity.

It should be noted that before carrying out the electroplating of step c5 it is preferable to perform degreasing and washing to remove any residue from the resist development of the previous process and to remove any oxide coating present that may be formed on the surface which has been exposed to light in a previous process of the conductive layer formed in the step c3 .

Distilled water a dilute acid or a dilute oxidizing agent aqueous solution may be used for such degreasing and washing and a dilute acidic oxidizing agent aqueous solution is preferably used. Hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid may be used as such an acid and hydrogen peroxide and ammonium persulfate may be used as such an oxidizing agent. The concentration of the acidic oxidizing agent is preferably from 0.01 mass to 1 mass and the treatment is preferably conducted at a temperature of from room temperature to 50 C. for 1 to 30 minutes.

Examples of the metal used for electroplating in this step include copper chromium lead nickel gold silver tin zinc and the like. From a standpoint of the conductivity thereof copper gold and silver are preferable and copper is more preferable.

An additive is preferably included in the electroplating bath used for the electroplating in this step from a standpoint of improving characteristics of the metal film when applied to electronic circuits such as the smoothness extendibility and conductivity characteristics.

Commercial electroplating additives for electroplating may be used as such an additive. Specific examples of such additives include for example janus green B JGB SPS sulfopropylthiorate polyethylene glycol various kinds of surfactants and the like. Moreover mixtures thereof marketed by metal plating liquid manufacturers may be used such as the COPPER GLEAM series made by Meltex Incorporated the TOP LUCINA series made by Okuno Chemical Industries Co. Ltd. and the CU BRITE Series made by Ebara udylite Co. Ltd. These may be selected according to the mechanical characteristics of the metal film to be obtained and the like.

Specific modes of the type and addition amount of the additive may be suitably adjusted in consideration of various characteristics such as speed of electroplating current density during electroplating and internal stress of the metal film formed. Specifically the chemical concentration of such an additive may be from 0.1 mg L to 1.0 mg L and for a commercial electroplating liquid from 1 ml L to 50 ml L may be added depending to each manufacturer s catalog .

In the step a5 the electroplating is preferably performed at a current density of from 0.1 mA cmto 3 mA cmuntil the consumption of quantity of electricity reaches from 1 10 to of the total consumption of quantity of electricity required from the commencement of electric current flow to the termination of electric current flow. By performing the electroplating in this step at a small current density for a certain period of time from the start of current flow a uniform metal coating film can be formed on a substrate having a relatively high surface resistance and a fine metal film having excellent electrical conductivity and applicability to electronic circuits can be formed due to the slow growth of the metal film.

The period for performing electroplating at the current density within the above range may be suitably set according to the application or properties and the like of the metal film to be formed within the time period in which the consumption of quantity of electricity reaches from 1 10 to of the total consumption of quantity of electricity required from the commencement of electric current flow to the termination of electric current flow. Moreover the amount of the current density may also be suitably set within the above range.

The electroplating in this step is further performed by increasing the current density after performing for a certain time period at a small current density in the above range. The degree of increasing the current density may be appropriately adjusted but is normally from 2 to 20 times preferably from 3 to 5 times the current density at the commencement of electric current flow.

There are no particular limitations to the mode of increasing the current density and modes which may be adopted include a linear increase a stepwise increase and an exponential increase. The current density is preferably increased linearly from the standpoint of uniformity in the metal plating coating film.

The film thickness of the metal pattern formed by electroplating differs according to the application and may be controlled by adjusting the metal concentration in the plating bath immersion duration therein or the current density. It should be noted that the film thickness when applied to general electrical wiring and the like from the standpoint of conductivity thereof is preferably 0.3 m or more and is more preferably 3 m or more.

The surface resistivity of the metal pattern formed in step a5 is 1 10 square or less and is preferably 1 10 square or less.

It should be noted that the surface resistivities in the present specification adopt values measured according to a four terminal four probe method and a constant current method using a resistivity meter LORESTA EP MCP T360 made by Dia Instruments Co. Ltd.

In the step a6 the resist layer is separated subsequent to the formation of the metal pattern in step a5 .

Separation can be performed by spraying with a release liquid. Although release liquids vary depending on the type of resist generally a solvent or a liquid that cause the resist to swell is sprayed to separate the swelled resist.

In the step a7 the resist layer is removed from the region that has been protected by the conductive layer formed in the step a3 .

Removal of the conductive layer is performed by dissolution and removal of the conductive layer. Dissolution and removal may be performed using as a conductive layer removing liquid an aqueous solution containing a chelating agent for promoting dissolution of a metal salt an oxidizing agent for oxidizing and ionizing the metal an acid for dissolving the metal and the like and immersing the substrate in the removing liquid or spraying the removing liquid on the substrate.

The chelating agents include commercially available metal chelating agents such as EDTA NTA phosphoric acid organic amine and sulfur compounds. The chelating agent can be selected from a chelating agent capable of coordinating to the metal in the conductive layer.

Specific examples capable of being used as the chelating agents include compounds described in DOJINDO Laboratories 17 Edition Overall Catalogue published by DOJINDO LABORATORIES. For example when the conductive layer is made of copper the use of chelating agents such as EDTA and NTA organic amines such as imidazole pyridine and benzotriazole and a sulfur compound such as mercaptothiazole is preferable. When the conductive layer is made of silver the use of organic amines such as imidazole and pyridine sulfur compounds such as mercaptothiazole and 1 2 ethylsulfonate 5 mercaptotetrazole chelating agents such as hypo and 1 4 5 trimethyl 1 2 4 tetrazonium 3 thiolate is preferable.

The acids include sulfuric acid hydrochloric acid nitric acid and the like. The concentration of the acid is preferably from 0.1 mass to 10 mass relative to the total mass of the aqueous solution more preferably from 0.5 mass to 5 mass .

For the aqueous solution for use in dissolving and removing the conductive layer in this step an aqueous solution containing the combination of the oxidizing agent the chelating agent and the acid is preferable. The pH value of the aqueous solution for use in dissolving and removing the conductive layer is preferably within the range of 0 to 6. For the purpose of adjusting the pH within the range a buffering agent may be added. As the buffering agent organic or inorganic acids such as acetic acid phthalic acid and phosphoric acid may be used.

The treatment temperature when performing the dissolution and removal of the conductive layer is preferably in the range of from room temperature to 60 C. However in order to accelerate or decelerate the reaction the temperature may be set to higher or lower as compared with the range. The treatment time is preferably from several seconds to 30 minutes. A too long treatment time damages the conductive layer metal pattern formed by the electroplating. Therefore a short time treatment is preferable.

The hydrophobilizing treatment is preferably a treatment in which a hydrophobilizing agent is applied to the polymer layer to react the hydrophobilizing agent and the polymer including the polymer layer hereinafter sometimes simply referred to as polymer .

As the hydrophobilizing agent a metal forming a hydrophobic salt with the polymer or an organic reaction reagent reacting with the polymer to form a hydrophobic compound is preferably used.

The metals capable of forming a hydrophobic salt with the polymer includes silver iron zinc aluminum calcium and the like are mentioned. In particular polyvalent metals have a high hydrophobilizing ability and zinc aluminum and calcium are preferably used.

As the interaction group possessed by the graft polymer as stated above a hydrophilic carboxyl group sulfonyl group and hydroxyl group are preferable. As the hydrophobilizing agent that hydrophobilizes these hydrophilic groups polyvalent metal salts and alkylating agents are preferable.

Methods of applying the hydrophobilizing agent to the polymer layer includes such methods as i preparing an aqueous solution dissolving the hydrophobilizing agent therein or a treatment solution obtained by dissolving it in various organic solvents and applying the aqueous solution or the treatment solution to the polymer layer and ii in the case of organic reagent or the like making it into gas and applying the same to the polymer layer in the gas phase. Among these application methods the method of applying an aqueous solution or treatment solution which is a simpler and easier method is preferably used.

Meanwhile when a metal forming a hydrophobic salt with the polymer is used as the hydrophobilizing agent in the preparation of the aqueous solution or treatment solution containing a hydrophobilizing agent a metal salt including a metal that forms a hydrophobic salt with the polymer may be dissolved in a solvent to prepare the aqueous solution or treatment solution.

For the solvent in addition to water hydrophilic organic solvents such as an alcohol acetone and DMSO are preferably used because they accelerate the penetration of the hydrophobilizing agent into the polymer.

When performing the application of the hydrophobilizing agent using an aqueous solution dissolving the hydrophobilizing agent or a treatment solution obtained by dissolving the agent in various kinds of organic solvents the concentration of the hydrophobilizing agent in the aqueous solution or treatment solution is preferably from 0.1 mass to 10 mass more preferably from 1 mass to 5 mass .

The duration time required for the hydrophobilizing treatment is preferably from 10 seconds to 30 minutes. In order to shorten the step it is preferable that a short time treatment is preferable. In order to perform a short time treatment it is sufficient to increase the stirring speed of the treatment bath or to increase the temperature of the treatment liquid.

A second aspect of the metal pattern forming method of the present invention is a metal pattern forming method including the steps of 

 b1 a step of providing on a substrate a polymer layer that comprises a polymer containing a functional group that interacts with a metal colloid the polymer directly chemically bonding to the substrate 

 b2 a step of applying a metal colloid to the polymer layer to form a conductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square 

 b3 a step of forming a pattern shaped resist layer on the conductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square 

 b4 a step of forming in a region where the resist layer is not formed a metal pattern by electroplating 

 b6 a step of removing the conductive layer formed in the step b2 from the region that has been protected by the resist layer and

 b7 a step of performing a hydrophobilizing treatment to the polymer layer that has been provided in the step b1 and exists in the region from which the conductive layer has been removed in the step b6 .

Namely the metal pattern forming method 2 includes a step b2 of applying a metal colloid to the polymer layer and forming the conductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square in place of steps a2 and a3 of the metal pattern forming method 1 .

In the step b1 a polymer layer is provided on a substrate the polymer layer including a polymer containing a functional group an interactive group that interacts with a metal colloid and directly chemically bonding to the substrate. The step b1 in the metal pattern forming method 2 is similar to the step a1 in the metal film forming method 1 and preferable modes thereof are also similar.

In step b2 a metal colloid is applied to the polymer layer formed in step b1 and a conductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square is formed thereon. Namely in this step the interactive group of the graft polymer which configures the polymer layer adheres adsorbs the applied metal colloid according to the function of the group thereby forming the conductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square.

The metal colloid applied to this step is mainly a zero valent metal and examples thereof include Pd g Cu Ni Al Fe Co and the like. In the present invention Pd and Ag are particularly preferable due to their good handling characteristics and their high level of catalyzing ability. A metal colloid which has been charge adjusted is generally used in a technique of attaching a zero valent metal to the graft polymer interactive region and such a metal colloid can be produced by reducing metal ions of the above metal in a solution in the presence of a charged surfactant or a charged protective agent. The charge may be varied by the surfactant used and selectively adsorbed to the graft pattern by the interaction with the interactive group on the graft pattern.

Methods for applying the metal colloid to the graft polymer include a method of dispersing the metal colloid in a suitable dispersion medium or dissolving a metal salt in a suitable solvent and coating a liquid containing the dissociated metal ions onto the substrate surface carrying the graft polymer or immersing the substrate carrying the graft polymer in such a dispersion or solution. By contacting the solution containing the metal ions the metal ions can be adsorbed to the interactive group of the patterned portions using ion ion or bipolar ion interaction. From a standpoint of carrying out sufficient adsorption it is preferable that the metal ion concentration or metal salt concentration of the solution for contacting is in the range from 1 to 50 mass and the range from 10 to 30 mass is still more preferable. Moreover the contact time is preferably from about 1 minute to 24 hours and it is more preferably from about 5 minutes to 1 hour.

In addition in the step b2 it is also possible to apply a metal colloid to the polymer layer and by performing electroless plating while using the metal colloid as an electroless plating catalyst to form an electroconductive layer having a surface resistivity of from 5 square to 100 k square. For the electroless plating the item in the description about the step a3 is applicable to the step b2 in the same way.

The steps b3 to b7 in the metal pattern forming method 2 are similar to respective steps a4 to a8 in the metal pattern forming method 1 and preferable modes thereof are also similar.

The metal pattern of the invention is the metal pattern that is obtained by the method for forming a metal pattern of the invention.

The metal pattern which is obtained by the present invention preferably have a metal pattern provided on a substrate having surface irregularities of no more than 500 nm and more preferably no more than 100 nm. Moreover the adhesiveness of such a substrate and such a metal film is preferably 0.2 kN m or more. Namely there is excellent adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal film even though the substrate surface is smooth.

In addition the metal pattern obtained by the present invention is a metal pattern having an excellent insulation reliability where a region in which the metal pattern is not present has high insulating property.

More specifically the metal pattern which is obtained in the present invention is formed by providing on a substrate with surface irregularities of no more than 500 nm preferably no more than 100 nm a polymer layer which includes a polymer that has an interacting ability and directly chemically bonds to the substrate applying a metal ion or a metal salt to the polymer layer reducing and depositing a metal or applying a metal colloid to the polymer layer and thereafter performing electroplating. The adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal film is preferably 0.2 kN m or more more preferably 0.3 kN m or more particularly preferably 0.7 kN m or more.

Here although there is no upper limit to the value of the above adhesiveness a sensible range is from about 0.2 to about 2.0 kN m. In addition the value of the adhesiveness of a substrate to a metal pattern in a conventional metal pattern is commonly from about 0.2 to about 3.0 kN m. Taking this into consideration it can be seen that the metal film of the present invention has sufficient adhesiveness in practice.

Thus the metal pattern of the present invention enables the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal film to be maintained while suppressing the irregularities at the substrate side interface to a minimum level.

As the insulation property in a region in which no metal pattern is present the surface resistivity is preferably 100 M square 10E 8 square or more. By the hydrophobilizing treatment in the invention 10E 11 square or more can be achieved.

It should be noted that the surface irregularities is a value measured by cutting a substrate or the metal film after formation thereof perpendicularly to the substrate surface and observing the cut face using a SEM. More specifically the Rz measured according to JIS B0601 namely the difference between the average of the Z data from the maximum peak to the fifth highest peak and the average of the Z data from the minimum valley to the fifth lowest valley should be no more than 500 nm.

Moreover the value of the adhesiveness between the substrate and the metal pattern is a value obtained by bonding a copper plate thickness 0.1 mm using an epoxy adhesive ARALDITE made by Ciba Geigy onto the metal pattern surface drying at 140 C. for 4 hours then conducting a 90 degree peel test according to JIS C6481 or conducting a 90 degree peel test based on JISC6481 by directly peeling off an end portion of the metal pattern itself.

In a common metal pattern a metal pattern having excellent high frequency characteristics may be obtained by making the irregularities of the substrate surface i.e. the irregularities of the interface with the metal pattern 500 nm or less. However in a conventional metal pattern since the adhesiveness of the substrate and the metal pattern would fall if the irregularities of the substrate surface are reduced roughening of the substrate surface by various surface roughening methods cannot be avoided. Consequently a method of providing a metal pattern on such a roughened surface is performed and therefore the irregularities of the interface in a conventional metal film is generally 1 000 nm or more.

However since the metal pattern obtained by the present invention is in a hybrid state with the graft polymer directly chemically bonded to the substrate even though the irregularities of the substrate surface is small the irregularities at the interface of the metal pattern inorganic component and polymer layer organic component obtained are small and superior adhesiveness may be maintained.

In the metal pattern of the present invention a substrate with surface irregularities of no more than 500 nm is preferably selected however with regard to the surface irregularities no more than 300 nm is more preferable no more than 100 nm is even more preferable and most preferable is no more than 50 nm. There are no particular limitations to the lower limit thereof however about 5 nm may be considered to be the lower limit from a practical standpoint of the ease of production and the like. It should be noted that when using the metal pattern obtained by the present invention as metal wiring the smaller the irregularities at the interface of the metal which forms the metal wiring and the organic material the smaller the power loss during high frequency power transmission and so a small irregularities of the surface are preferable.

As mentioned above the value of the ten point average roughness Rz is a value according to the method set out in JIS B0601 and the irregularities of the substrate surface is selected to be 500 nm or less preferably 300 nm or less even more preferably 100 nm or less and most preferably 50 nm or less.

For such a smooth substrate one which itself is smooth such as a resin substrate may be selected or one with relatively large irregularities may be used by regulating the irregularity to be within the preferable range by providing an intermediate layer thereon.

The metal pattern of the present invention may for example be applied as a semiconductor chip various kinds of printed wiring boards FPC COF TAB antennas multilayer wiring substrates mother boards and digital image display devices.

The printed wiring board of the invention can be produced by forming the metal pattern of the invention on a substrate to be an electroconductive layer wiring .

The printed wiring board of the invention has a conductive layer that exhibits high adhesiveness between a substrate and that has fine and high density and at the same time being excellent in the insulation property between the electroconductive layers wirings . Therefore in spite of fine wiring no shirt circuit occurs to give a printed wiring board with a high reliability.

There are no particular limitations to be the substrates usable for the printed wiring board of the invention and the examples of them include publicly known laminated boards used in usual wiring boards for example glass cloth epoxy resin paper phenol resin paper epoxy resin and glass cloth glass paper epoxy resin. In addition a BT substrate formed by impregnating bismaleimide triazine resin and further a polyimide film substrate using a polyimide film as a base material can also be used.

Moreover the printed wiring board of the present invention can be formed into a multilayer printed wiring board through the buildup with an insulating material layer or an electric circuit substrate formed on an insulating material layer.
