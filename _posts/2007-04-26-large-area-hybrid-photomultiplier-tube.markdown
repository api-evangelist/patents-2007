The preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated by way of example below and in . As shown in the photomultiplier tube includes a photocathode a semiconductor device and a container . The photocathode emits photoelectrons in correspondence with incident light. The semiconductor device has an electron incident surface for receiving photoelectrons from the photocathode . The container has a first opening and a second opening with the photocathode disposed at the first opening and the semiconductor device disposed at the second opening .

In the description of the present invention the invention will be discussed in a laser radar environment however this invention can be utilized for any type of need that requires use of a photomultiplier tube or photodetector.

A photocathode may be defined but without limitation as an electrode used for obtaining photoelectric emission when irradiated or a conductor through which a current enters or leaves an electric or electronic device. As shown in the photocathode is disposed at the first opening of the container . The photocathode may include a glass portion a photosensitive layer and a photocathode electrode . The glass portion may be disposed on the photosensitive layer while the photosensitive layer is electrically connected to the photocathode electrode . The glass portion may be disposed adjacent to the first opening and adjacent to the interior of the container . In one of the embodiments of the invention as shown in the photosensitive layer may be disposed between the glass portion and the interior of the container . The glass portion may be spherically shaped convex shaped curved cone shaped flat or any shape practicable. In the preferred embodiment the glass portion has a convexo concave shape or similar to a portion of a hollow sphere and the photosensitive layer is similarly shaped to the glass portion and the photocathode electrode is disposed along the edge or outer diameter of the photosensitive layer . In one of the embodiments of the invention the photosensitive layer is curved or spherically curved or shaped and corresponds to the glass portion and the photocathode electrode is ring shaped and is disposed around the outer diameter of the photosensitive layer .

The container may be a cone shaped container as shown in a trapezoid shaped container a pyramid shaped container or any shape practicable. The container is a vacuum container and may be manufactured from ceramic glass any type of composite material or any material practicable. The inner surface of the container may be covered by resistive material . The resistive material may be but without limitation graphite. The photocathode and the semiconductor device are disposed at their respective openings of the container such that they create a vacuum within the interior of the container .

When utilizing a cone shaped container or a pyramid shaped container in the preferred embodiment of the invention the second opening of the container is disposed at the vertex of the cone or pyramid container the vertex of the container may be defined but without limitation as the end with the smaller sized cross sectional area or the tip portion of the conic section formed by the cone shaped container . Thus the electron incident surface of the semiconductor device is mounted near or on an inner surface of the vertex of the cone or pyramid container . This avoids bombardment of electrons arriving at portions other than the electron incident surface of the semiconductor device . Furthermore it prevents creating positive ions inside the photomultiplier tube and damage to the photocathode as well as providing a long period of operation and improving noise factor.

As seen in in the preferred embodiment of the cone shaped container as well as in the pyramid shaped container the first opening is larger than the second opening . In the cone shaped container the trapezoid shaped container and the pyramid shaped container embodiments of the invention the second opening has an area not greater than that of the electron incident surface of the semiconductor device .

A collector of positive ions may be disposed in the center of the photocathode . The collector may be an electrode and manufactured from a conductive material such as but without limitation a kovar metal a kovar metal may be defined but without limitation as metal in the group of alloys which show a sharp change in the coefficient of expansion at certain temperatures . As shown in the collector of positive ions may be welded in the center of the photocathode specifically at the longitudinal and latitudinal center or at the positional pole of the photocathode or at an area at the approximate center of the first opening of the container . As seen in the collector of positive ions may be disposed and extend through the glass portion and the photosensitive layer . In the preferred embodiment the collector of positive ions is substantially perpendicular to the glass portion and the photosensitive layer and extends entirely through the glass portion and the photosensitive layer . The collector of positive ions may be extended in length or diameter for a particular tube size and dimension ratio.

As discussed above the semiconductor device includes an electron incident surface that is disposed at the second opening of the container . In the preferred embodiment the semiconductor device may include one or more semiconductor diodes . The semiconductor diode may include three separate layers formed on an n GaAs substrate. As shown in the layers include a top layer a middle layer and a bottom layer . In the preferred embodiment the top layer is doped to be a p type AlGaAs layer approximately 250 A thick and may form the electron incident surface or at least a portion of it . The top layer provides a potential barrier near the surface of the semiconductor diode to keep generated electron minority carries from recombining at the surface. The composition of the top layer is also chosen for stability and for its resistance to oxidation during processing in air. In the preferred embodiment the middle layer is doped to be p type GaAs approximately 0.25 microns thick while the bottom layer is undoped GaAs and is approximately 6 microns thick.

The semiconductor device may be mounted on a ceramic isolator and connected to a coaxial feedthrough central conductor . The coaxial feedthrough central conductor may be attached to a cable not shown which can transmit any type of electrical signal. The signal may be transmitted to processor computer or any type of acceptor of signals. The ceramic isolator may be an annulus with an aperture axially extending such that the coaxial feedthrough central conductor may partially be in the aperture of the ceramic isolator .

The photomultiplier tube may also include a collecting anode . The collecting anode may include the semiconductor device . The collecting anode may include an external conductor . The external conductor may include an annular section a disk section and a flange section . At one of the ends of the annular section the disk section and the flange section may be disposed preferably at the end closest to the container . The annular section the disk section and the flange section may all be axially aligned. The disk section may be ring like with an outer diameter larger than the annular section . The flange section may be ring like and disposed on the outer edge or outer diameter of the disk section as well as the outer diameter of the ceramic isolator . In one of the embodiments of the invention the disk section and the ceramic isolator may be the same element. The top layer of the semiconductor device can be connected to the external conductor specifically the disk section by a very thin conductor and via the ceramic isolator . The collecting anode forms the matched load requirements for transmission of high frequency signals. The coaxial feedthrough central conductor functions as a part of the vacuum container of the photomultiplier tube for coupling the output signal externally of the vacuum. The coaxial feedthrough central conductor may be insulated and or enveloped by glass and may be fixed to and or disposed within the external conductor and the ceramic isolator .

As shown in the photomultiplier tube may also include a confining electrode . The confining electrode may be embedded in the container at or near the second opening or at or near the vertex of the container . The confining electrode may be ring like and have an opening which contributes to confine the spread of photoelectrons. The opening of confining electrode corresponds to the interior of the container and has the area not greater than that of the second opening of the container and avoids bombardment of electrons arriving at portions other than the electron incident surface of the semiconductor device . The confining electrode may further include a lip that is disposed on the inner diameter of the confining electrode .

The confining electrode may be isolated from the external conductor of the collecting anode by a ring . The ring may be manufactured but without limitation from a ceramic or glass. The confining electrode is applied with a predetermined voltage from an external voltage source not shown and held at positive or negative potential of about 0 200 volts depending on electron incident surface size.

In operation light enters the photocathode specifically through the glass portion . An accelerate voltage on the order of about 4 12 kV is typically applied between the photocathode electrode and the collection anode and or semiconductor device of the hybrid photomultiplier tube . The bias voltage on the order of several volts is applied to the semiconductor device between the collection anode and the coaxial feedthrough central conductor . Same or higher than to photocathode voltage on the order of about 4 12 kV is typically applied to the collector of positive ions . Positive ions generated on the electron incident surface of the semiconductor device will pass by the shortest trajectory and be collected by the collector of positive ions . Same or higher potential prevents photocathode bombardment by positive ions generated on the electron incident surface of the semiconductor device and prevents the photosensitive layer and the photocathode from degrading. It prevents damage to the photocathode and provides a long time of operating and improves noise factor too.

The photosensitive layer emits photoelectrons in correspondence with incident light. The electron incident surface receives the photoelectrons from the photocathode . The electrons are accelerated by the applied field and bombard the electron incident surface of semiconductor device .
