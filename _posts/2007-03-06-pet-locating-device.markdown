This application claims priority and the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e from United States Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 844 089 entitled Apparatus for Providing Physical Location of Domestic Animals filed Sep. 13 2006 which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully disclosed herein.

The present invention relates generally systems for locating pets that are lost and in particular to GPS enabled pet locating system.

Within the pet industry and in particular within the pet locator market there have been many attempts to use technology to assist owners who have lost their pets. Some have used radiofrequency while others have used GPS locators in complex systems.

Such systems have failed to provide a product or service that is acceptable to the marketplace in simplicity usability and features.

A need exists therefore for a pet location system that includes a pet locator with GPS capabilities in communication with a wireless network such that a user interface is accessible on a common computer network or by telephone.

All references cited herein are incorporated by reference to the maximum extent allowable by law. To the extent a reference may not be fully incorporated herein it is incorporated by reference for background purposes and indicative of the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.

The problems presented in pet location are solved by the systems and methods of the present invention. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention a pet location system that includes a pet locator with GPS capabilities in communication with a wireless network such that a user interface accessible on a common computer network or by telephone is provided. Such a system would preferably include a database accessed by the user interface with user data associated with locator data to assist the user in managing an account as well as querying the pet locator for location or diagnostic information.

Additional features would include the ability to phone into the user interface via a standard telephone number to query the pet locator with automated commands or by phoning into an operator who would query the pet locator via the user interface and give location information verbally. Further additional features would include the ability of third parties to access location information from the user interface to provide additional services such as display of location information on portable display devices such as phones and handheld computers or integration of location information into other services provided to the user by third parties.

Other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent with reference to the drawings and detailed description that follow.

All references cited herein are incorporated by reference to the maximum extent allowable by law. To the extent a reference may not be fully incorporated herein it is incorporated by reference for background purposes and indicative of the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.

In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific preferred embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention and it is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical mechanical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. To avoid detail not necessary to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention the description may omit certain information known to those skilled in the art. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Logic module is connected to wireless module and GPS module by flexible electronic connections so that pet locator may flex to fit a variety of pets . Wireless module is connected to wireless antenna and GPS module is connected to GPS antenna by flexible electronic connections as well. Battery pack is shown connected to logic module and supplies electrical power to pet locator .

The user interface is intended to provide a variety of functions and query options. Interface would require login and verification of the user to prevent unauthorized access. Interface would allow an authorized user to initiate a query to the pet locator requesting a wide variety of information such as any of the following information location battery power level self diagnostics report GPS signal reception wireless signal reception continuous tracking. Query functions may be added or deleted based on service contract or need. A location query would instruct logic module to activate GPS module and receive GPS signals from the GPS system at the GPS antenna . The location information would then be transmitted back to the message server to be accessed via the user interface or the support center . The location information would be translated into a format selected by the user such as street address or graphical representation. A continuous location query would instruct the logic module to repeat this process providing location information at a pre selected interval until the logic control is instructed to quit transmitting. System information queries such as battery power level signal strengths and self diagnostics would instruct the logic module to perform the requested tasks and report the requested information back to the message database . The small size of the battery is assisted by the fact that much of the pet locator is not powered until a query is received. Only the wireless module needs power on a consistent basis and even that can be reduced by operating at a pre selected interval instead of continuously.

User interface allows for the multiple pet locators to be associated with a single user and provides other customer service and sales functions such as answering common questions about the system advertising service plans and accepting credit card payment.

External application interfaces allow for third party access to the search database and message server via the telecommunications network or computer network . External application interfaces may be used by third parties such as cellular phone service providers or GPS service providers to add the pet locator location information into enriched programs such as an enriched graphical representation incorporating data from other sources as well. By providing API that allow access for external application interfaces it is expected that third parties will develop niche products using pet locator information for potential clients.

The primary advantage of the present invention is the flexibility of the application bridge and the user interface to handle a wide variety of tasks and data and provide for future uses by third parties. While the utility has been described most clearly in the context of locating pets a similar system may be easily modified for the location of people and other animate objects. For example pet locator may be modified to fit a belt of a child and pet location system may be modified to be used by parents guardians or police to locate a child reported missing.

It should be apparent from the foregoing that an invention having significant advantages has been provided. While the invention is shown in only a few of its forms it is not just limited but is susceptible to various changes and modifications without departing from the spirit thereof.
