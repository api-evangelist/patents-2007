The field of the invention is data processing or more specifically methods systems and products for creating a session log for studying usability of one or more computing devices used for social networking.

When computer architects design a computing device and its software these architects often make a great effort to ensure that the device is convenient and easy to use from the perspective of a user. For example the buttons on the device should be easily accessible when needed for device interaction while not hindering the user s interaction with the device when the buttons are not in use. As a further example the graphical user interface of a device should be logically arranged and configured from the user s perspective such that the user s interaction with the device is intuitive for the user.

To ensure that a computing device is convenient and easy to use from a user s perspective computer architects typically perform usability studies on the interaction of a user with the computing device. Usability refers to a full range of aspects that impact a user s success and satisfaction when interacting with the device. Usability encompass issues such as for example a user s understanding of how to operate the device s interface the ease with which a user is able to physically manipulate the device and its controls a user s emotions while interacting with the device the correspondence between the user s desired output from the device and the output actually produced by the device and so on. In studying a device s usability high usability is generally regarded as a desirable feature of the device.

Usability studies have traditionally been conducted by having a usability expert observe a user interacting with a computing device and record the expert s observations in a log. The drawback to this traditional approach to studying usability is that the information recorded in the log is limited to the observations capable of being observed by a usability expert. As devices have become smaller and more complex the ability of a usability expert to observe important aspects affecting the user s interaction with a computing device is greatly diminished. In particular some aspects of the user s interaction may not be observable at all. As such readers will appreciate that room for improvement exists in the area of studying the usability of a computing device.

Methods systems and products are disclosed for creating a session log for studying usability of one or more computing devices used for social networking that include receiving by a usability engine from at least one usability expert usability observations observed by the usability expert during a usability session for studying interaction support provided by one or more computing devices to a plurality of users interacting within a social network through the computing devices recording by the usability engine the usability observations in a session log detecting by an event listener on at least one of the computing devices an event generated by the computing device as a result of an interaction among the plurality of users within the social network notifying by the event listener the usability engine of the event and recording by the usability engine a description of the event in the session log.

The event listener notifies the usability engine of the event. The usability engine then records a description of the event in the session log .

A social network is a network of users having a particular type of relationship among one another. For example a social network may be composed of all the people within a particular family because each member of the family has a familial relationship with other family members. As a further example a social network may be composed of all the people within a particular company because each member of the company has a working relationship with other company members. A still further example a social network may be composed of a group of people having the same interests such as for example sports hobbies or games.

In the example of user and user belong to the same social network and interact within that social network through the computing devices . The computing device is connected to data communications network through wireless connection and the computing device is connected to data communications network through wireless connection .

A usability session is a period of time dedicated by a user to interact with a particular computing device being studied for usability.

In the example of the observation recorder may provide the observation data to a usability engine using data communications architectures such as for example web services CORBA Java Remote Method Invocation API and so on. CORBA refers to the Common Object Request Broker Architecture a computer industry specifications for interoperable enterprise applications produced by the Object Management Group OMG . CORBA is a standard for remote procedure invocation first published by the OMG in 1991. CORBA can be considered a kind of object oriented way of making remote procedure calls although CORBA supports features that do not exist in conventional RPC. CORBA uses a declarative language the Interface Definition Language IDL to describe an object s interface. Interface descriptions in IDL are compiled to generate stubs for the client side and skeletons on the server side. Using this generated code remote method invocations effected in object oriented programming languages such as C or Java look like invocations of local member methods in local objects.

The Java Remote Method Invocation API is a Java application programming interface for performing remote procedural calls published by Sun Microsystems . The Java RMI API is an object oriented way of making remote procedure calls between Java objects existing in separate Java Virtual Machines that typically run on separate computers. The Java RMI API uses a remote procedure object interface to describe remote objects that reside on the server. Remote procedure object interfaces are published in an RMI registry where Java clients can obtain a reference to the remote interface of a remote Java object. Using compiled stubs for the client side and skeletons on the server side to provide the network connection operations the Java RMI allows a Java client to access a remote Java object just like any other local Java object.

Because each usability expert has a particular role in studying the interaction support provided by the computing devices not all of the event descriptions detected on the device may be relevant to all of the usability experts . In the method of therefore providing by the usability engine to each of the usability experts the description of the event is carried out by filtering the description of the event to be provided to each usability expert in dependence upon the particular role of each usability expert . The usability engine may filter the description of the event to be provided to each usability expert according to the method of by determining whether a particular usability expert is authorized for receive particular types of event descriptions in dependence upon usability expert profiles . If a particular usability expert is authorized for receive particular types of event descriptions in dependence upon usability expert profiles then the usability engine provides the particular usability expert with the description of the event . If a particular usability expert is not authorized for receive particular types of event descriptions in dependence upon usability expert profiles then the usability engine does not provide the particular usability expert with the description of the event .

The usability expert profiles of represent data structures that associate types of event descriptions with particular usability experts. Associating a particular type of event description with particular usability experts in a usability expert profile indicates that the particular usability expert is authorized to receive event descriptions of that type. For further explanation consider the following exemplary usability expert profile 

The exemplary usability expert profile above associates types of event descriptions with three usability experts identified as Expert1 Expert2 and Expert3. The exemplary usability expert profile above associates the SpeechListener event description type with usability expert Expert1 which indicates that usability expert Expert1 is authorized to receive event descriptions of events generated by the event listener identified as SpeechListener. The exemplary usability expert profile above associates the DevButtonListener event description type with usability expert Expert2 which indicates that usability expert Expert2 is authorized to receive event descriptions of events generated by the event listener identified as DevButtonListener. The exemplary usability expert profile above associates the GUIListener event description type with usability expert Expert3 which indicates that usability expert Expert3 is authorized to receive event descriptions of events generated by the event listener identified as GUIListener. Readers will note that the exemplary usability expert profile above is for explanation and not for limitation.

As mentioned above a usability engine may provide a usability observation video to usability experts allowing them to view the interaction between a user and the computing device being studied for usability. When a usability engine provides a usability observation video to the usability experts the usability engine may provide event descriptions to each of the experts by embedding the description of the event in the usability observation video being displayed to the experts. For further explanation consider that sets forth a flow chart illustrating a further exemplary method of creating a session log for studying usability of one or more computing devices used for social networking according to embodiments of the present invention.

The method of is similar to the method of . That is the method of includes receiving by a usability engine from at least one usability expert usability observations observed by the usability expert during a usability session for studying interaction support provided by one or more computing devices to a plurality of users interacting within a social network through the computing devices recording by the usability engine the usability observations in a session log detecting by an event listener on at least one of the computing devices an event generated by the computing device as a result of an interaction among the plurality of users within the social network notifying by the event listener the usability engine of the event and recording by the usability engine a description of the event in the session log .

The method of includes recording by a digital video recorder as a usability observation video at least one of the users interacting with the computing device on which the event was detected. The digital video recorder may record as a usability observation video a user interacting with the computing device according to the method of by converting analogue audio and video signals received from the recorder s audio visual input components into digital audio and video signals and storing the digital audio and video signals as frames using one or more codecs as will occur to those of skill in the art. The digital video recorder may then transmit the usability observation video to a usability computer having installed upon it the usability engine through a data communications connection.

In the method of providing by the usability engine to each of the usability experts the description of the event includes embedding by the usability engine the description of the event in the usability observation video . The usability engine may embed the description of the event in the usability observation video according to the method of by identifying the frames that make up the portion of the video recorded when the event listener detected the event described by the event description and storing the event description as metadata in the frames that make up the identified portion of the video . The usability engine may store the event description as metadata using for example closed captioning channels such as Line in the vertical blanking interval or those described in the Electronic Industries Alliance EIA 708 specification or some other metadata structures for the video as will occur to those of skill in the art.

In the example of the event description for the event specifies the time at which the event listener on the computing device detected the event . Furthermore the usability observation video of includes embedded timecodes. The timecodes embedded in the usability observation video are signals typically encoded in each frame of the usability observation video to identify each frame and to provide the frame s relative location in the video timeline. The timecodes embedded in the usability observation video may be implemented as Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers SMPTE timecodes MIDI timecodes Rewriteable Consumer timecodes and any other timecodes as will occur to those of skill in the art.

The usability engine may identify the portion of the usability observation video recorded when the event was detected by scanning the frames of the usability observation video to determine which frames have timecodes that match the time specified in the event description . The usability engine may identify the frames that have timecodes matching the time specified in the event description as the portion of the usability observation video recorded when the event was detected. When matching the timecodes of the frames to the time specified in the event description the usability engine may take into account any timing skews that result from two different clocks being used to embed the timecodes into the frames and the embed the time in the event description . To correct any such timing skews the usability engine may calculate the skew between the clock used to embed the timecodes into the frames and the clock used to embed the time in the event description and factor in the calculated timing skew when matching the timecodes of the frames to the time specified in the event description .

The method of also includes displaying by the usability engine the usability observation video to the usability expert for observing usability observations including displaying the description of the event . The usability engine may display the usability observation video to the usability expert according to the method of by receiving an indication to transmit the video from each of the usability experts and streaming the usability observation video to media players operated by the experts . The usability engine may display the usability observation video to the usability expert according to the method of in real time during the usability session or after the usability session has completed.
