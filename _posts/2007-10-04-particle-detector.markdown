The present invention relates to particle detectors and in particular to particle detectors that combine radiation scattering particle fluorescence and atomic emissions.

Particle detectors such as portable detectors may use optical methods in the detection of aerosols within fluid samples. Optical methods are useful in detecting potentially harmful aerosols such as biological aerosols that may be present after a biological agent attack or industrial accident. Biological molecules fluoresce when excited by ultraviolet UV radiation. As a result biological molecules in an aerosol sample can be optically detected by irradiating the sample with ultraviolet radiation and observing the fluorescence response. Since differing excitation wavelengths may be used to detect different classes of biological molecules the excitation wavelength can be chosen to detect specific classes of biological molecules such as proteins flavinoids and metabolite products. However detection methods that rely upon observing the fluorescence responses are susceptible to false positives in that certain non biological molecules produce fluorescence responses when irradiated by ultraviolet radiation that are similar to fluorescence responses of biological molecules. This makes it difficult to determine whether an aerosol is harmful or not.

Another way of determining whether an aerosol is a biological aerosol is to obtain an atomic emission from the aerosol e.g. using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy. The atomic emission is then detected with an optical detector. An electronic signal produced by the optical detector in response to the atomic emission is analyzed e.g. to determine whether inorganic materials such as calcium sodium potassium magnesium etc. that are typically found in manufactured biological agents are present. This method when coupled to fluorescence methods is less susceptible to false positives than fluorescence only methods. However this method requires expensive power intensive lasers and complex and expensive optical systems.

An embodiment of the disclosure provides a method of detecting particles that includes selectively collecting a bulk sample of the particles based on scattering properties of the particles and fluorescence properties of the particles exciting the bulk sample of particles to produce an atomic emission from the bulk sample of particles and determining atomic emission properties of the particles of the bulk sample from the atomic emission from the bulk sample of particles.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice these embodiments. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

For one embodiment particle detector includes a radiation scattering section configured to determine radiation scattering properties of the particles . Particle detector also includes a particle fluorescence section configured to determine fluorescence properties of the particles . A particle selection section is also included. Particle detector includes an atomic emission section configured to determine atomic emission properties of a bulk sample of particles selected by particle selection section based on the radiation scattering properties of the particles determined by radiation scattering section and the fluorescence properties of the particles determined by the particle fluorescence section . For another embodiment radiation scattering section particle fluorescence section particle selection section and atomic emission section are each coupled to a controller of particle detector configured to cause particle detector to perform the methods of the various embodiments discussed below.

For one embodiment as particles flow toward pump particles enter radiation scattering section where particles can be irradiated by radiation e.g. having a wavelength from about 800 to about 1200 nanometers emitted by a radiation source such as a laser that may be operated in a continuous mode of radiation scattering section . When radiation hits a particle scattered light is produced from particle . Scattered light in the form of excitation photons travels to an optical detector of radiation scattering section that detects scattered light . Detector produces an electrical signal e.g. an electrical current or voltage in response to the photons impacting the detector . Electrical signal is transmitted to controller that has a processor e.g. a computer. For one embodiment controller may digitize signal and record and analyze the digitized signal . For one embodiment controller performs methods of various embodiments of the disclosure as described below in response to computer readable instructions e.g. contained on a computer usable medium .

Based on digitized signal corresponding to the light scattered from particle controller may determine the size and or shape of particle e.g. using methods that are known to those of skill in the art. The size and or shape of particle may be compared to historical size and or shape data such as historical size and or shape data for certain particles such as particles or molecules of certain biological agents. For one embodiment statistical distributions of the size and or shape of particles may be obtained from the scattering data contained in electrical signal and compared to historical distributions of the size and or shape for the particles of biological aerosols.

When the size and or shape of a particle substantially matches the size and or shape of particles of a certain biological agent or aerosol or the statistical distributions of the size and or shape of particles substantially matches a historical size and or shape distribution then particles are determined to at least be potentially a particle of a biological aerosol. For example the aerosol containing particles is determined to be at least a biological threat. For example when a difference between the size of a particle and a particle of a biological agent is within a certain range i.e. a predetermined amount particle is determined to at least be potentially a particle of a biological aerosol i.e. at least a threat. Note that the size and or shape determination via scattering is susceptible to false positives in that the particles of non biological aerosols e.g. non biological threats can have sizes and or shapes that substantially match those of biological aerosols.

As particles continue to flow toward pump particles exit the radiation scattering section and enter particle fluorescence section where particles can be irradiated e.g. excited by excitation radiation in the near or deep ultra violet range e.g. having a wavelength from about 266 to about 380 nanometers emitted by a radiation source of particle fluorescence section . For one embodiment excitation radiation is nominally about 365 nanometers. Radiation source may be a laser a light emitting diode xenon arc lamp etc.

The wavelengths emitted by radiation source are known to generate fluorescence in biological aerosols. That is when particle is a particle of a biological aerosol when radiation hits particle particle fluoresces producing a fluorescence emission at a longer wavelength than radiation . Fluorescence emission can have a wavelength anywhere from about 10 nanometers to about a few hundred nanometers e.g. about 400 to about 700 nanometers when radiation has a nominal wavelength of about 365 nanometers. An optical detector of particle fluorescence section detects fluorescence emission in the form of fluorescence emission photons and outputs an electrical signal e.g. a voltage or current signal in response to detecting fluorescence emission to controller .

For one embodiment controller may digitize signal and record process and analyze the digitized signal . For one embodiment a filter is interposed between housing and detector e.g. in front of detector to filter the photons of scattered light from the photons of the fluorescence emission thereby substantially preventing the photons of scattered light from reaching detector .

Based on digitized signal corresponding to the fluorescence emission from particle controller may compare attributes of the fluorescence emission to certain e.g. predetermined historical attributes of the fluorescence for certain biological aerosols. For example spectra of the fluorescence emission may be compared to historical fluorescence spectra for certain biological aerosols. When the attributes of the fluorescence emission such as the spectra substantially match the predetermined attributes of a certain biological aerosol then particle is determined to at least be potentially a particle of a biological aerosol. That is the aerosol containing particles is determined to be at least a biological threat. Note that a fluorescence analysis is susceptible to false positives in that the particles of non biological aerosols e.g. non biological threats can have fluorescence emissions that substantially match those of biological aerosols.

Based on the fact that multiple excitation wavelengths are known to be useful in providing discrimination information among biological and ambient aerosols as particles continue to flow toward pump particles may be irradiated e.g. excited by one or more additional frequencies of excitation radiation within particle fluorescence section that are different from radiation . For example particles may be excited by excitation radiation from a radiation source e.g. similar to radiation source of particle fluorescence section having a nominal wavelength of about 280 nanometers when excitation radiation has a nominal wavelength of about 365 nanometers. When particle is a particle of a biological aerosol when radiation hits particle particle fluoresces generating a fluorescence emission e.g. at a wavelength of about 300 to about 700 nanometers when excitation radiation has a nominal wavelength of about 280 nanometers.

An optical detector of particle fluorescence section detects fluorescence emission in the form of fluorescence emission photons and outputs an electrical signal e.g. a voltage or current signal in response to detecting fluorescence emission to controller . For one embodiment controller may digitize signal and record process and analyze the digitized signal . For one embodiment a filter is interposed between housing and detector e.g. in front of detector to filter the photons of scattered light from the photons of the fluorescence emission thereby substantially preventing the photons of scattered light from reaching detector .

Based on digitized signal corresponding to the fluorescence emission from particle controller may compare attributes of the fluorescence emission to certain e.g. predetermined historical attributes of the fluorescence for certain biological aerosols. For example spectra of the fluorescence emission may be compared to historical fluorescence spectra for certain biological aerosols. When the attributes of the fluorescence emission such as the spectra substantially match the predetermined attributes of a certain biological aerosol then particle is determined to at least be potentially a particle of a biological aerosol. That is the aerosol containing particles is determined to be at least a biological threat. However as described above the biological threat could be a false positive in that the aerosol containing particles could be a non biological aerosol and thus a non biological threat.

Note that radiation source optical detector and filter are located downstream e.g. on the order of millimeters from radiation source optical detector and filter . This placement ensures that excitation radiation and excitation radiation do not overlap each other and that fluorescence emission and fluorescence emission do not overlap each other. In the event of an overlap it would be nearly impossible to determine which radiation source radiation source or radiation source produced fluorescence emission or fluorescence emission .

As indicated above scattering information or data contained in electrical signal and fluorescence information or data contained in electrical signals and provide information about the biological content of the aerosol of particles passing through the detector. The scattering information and fluorescence information enables the determination of scattering and fluorescence properties of the aerosol of particles that are compared to historical scattering and fluorescence properties for certain biological aerosols. When the thus determined scattering and fluorescence properties of the aerosol of particles substantially match historical scattering information and or the fluorescence information for biological aerosols then particles are defined as threat particles and the aerosol of threat particles is defined as a threat aerosol.

Optical detectors and can also be used to determine the velocity of the particles . For one embodiment the velocity of the particles may be determined from elapsed times between the particle detections at the respective optical detectors and the known distances between the respective optical detectors. For one embodiment controller determines when particles are located between opposing electrodes and of particle selection section as shown in based on the velocity of particles the distance from the last optical detector making a detection e.g. optical detector and electrodes and and the elapsed time since the last optical detector made a detection.

Opposing electrodes and are each electrically coupled to an electrical power source such as a DC power source of particle selection section . For one embodiment when controller determines that particles are located between electrodes and power source selectively applies a voltage to each of electrodes and in response to receiving a control signal from controller when controller has determined that particles are threat particles based on the analysis of the scattering data of signal and the analysis of the fluorescence data of at least one of signals and . That is control signal instructs power source to apply the voltage to each of electrodes and . However in the event that the analysis of the scattering data and the analysis of the fluorescence data indicates that particles are non biological e.g. non threat particles controller does not instruct power source to apply a voltage to each of electrodes and e.g. by not sending a control signal to power source . That is when no threat particles are detected power source does not apply a voltage to each of electrodes and when the particles are between electrodes and .

Particles that are located between electrodes and are ionized by a corona discharge generated by an electric field produced between electrodes and by the application of a voltage from power source . The electric field produced between the electrodes forms ions according to processes understood by those of skill in the art. As a result particles become electrically charged. Therefore controller decides whether or not to ionize particles based on the scattering and fluorescence properties of particles . Several alternative ionization techniques exist including radioactive photo ionization and field ionization.

After passing between electrodes and particles exit particle selection section and enter atomic emission section that includes a spark ionization section . Entry into atomic emission section is shown at . Spark ionization section includes a power source and field plates and . For one embodiment a spark plug e.g. of the type used in internal combustion engines may provide field plates and where field plates and are respectively the electrodes of the spark plug.

During operation of detector power source applies a first voltage to field plates and that positively charges one of plates and and negatively charges the other of plates and . When particles are determined to be non threat particles and are thus not charged between electrodes and the uncharged non threat particles pass through atomic emission section flow through the pump and are exhausted through outlet .

When particles are determined to be threat particles and are thus charged between electrodes and the charged threat particles migrate toward the one of plates and having the opposite charge under the influence of the electrostatic charge produced between plates and . The migration of a particle is exemplified by an example trajectory in . The attractive force between the particles and the plates and due to the unlike charges of the particles and the plates and acts to adhere the particles to the respective plates.

Controller can determine when a particle enters atomic emission section shown at from the above determined particle velocity and the known distance from electrodes and to the entry location . Controller can also determine the speed at which a particle travels in the electric field between plates and based on the mobility constant of that particle . Controller can then determine the actual time it takes the particle to travel within the field from entry point until that particle impacts a plate or based on the particle s initial position within the field e.g. entry point the total amount of charge on the particle the ability of the particle to move in air at atmospheric pressure the distance between the plates and and the voltage applied. In this way controller can determine when the particle arrives at the plate.

The air flow applied voltages the distance between the field plates and and ionization conditions are adjusted so that the charged particles impact the field plates. The process can be extended to allow multiple particles to impact and adhere to the plates over various periods of time. For example particles may be collected on field plate and or field plate for a certain e.g. predetermined time interval e.g. of about a minute. That is the particles are allowed to collect for the certain time interval after it is determined that particles have started to collect on field plate and or field plate . This produces a bulk sample of particles on field plate and or field plate .

Note that the bulk sample collected on field plate and or field plate contains substantially all particles that have been determined to be threat particles based on the scattering and fluorescence properties of these particles. That is detector can selectively collect bulk samples of threat particles based on the based on the scattering and fluorescence properties of these particles. This substantially reduces the number of non threat potential particles in the sample in that as described above the non threat particles are selectively exhausted without being collected on either of the field plates based on the scattering and fluorescence properties of these particles.

For one embodiment electrodes and may be replaced by tubes for example for providing air jets that can selectively blow threat particles onto the field plates in response to control signal . For example control signal selectively activates the air jets e.g. via a solenoid or the like when controller has determined that particles that are aligned with the tubes are threat particles. The threat particles subsequently adhere to the field plates due to impaction e.g. according to the same basic principle that causes particles to adhere in air filters.

The voltage output of power source may be increased to a second voltage that is higher than the first voltage to produce electrostatic fields between field plates and e.g. in values above 1 million volts meter. At these field strengths the air between the field plates becomes ionized resulting in a high voltage spark across the gap between field plates and . For one embodiment the voltage output of power source may be increased in response to receiving a control signal at power source from controller when controller has determined that particles are threat particles based on the scattering properties the fluorescence properties of these particles. For example control signal instructs power source to increase the voltage to field plates and when threat particles are collected on field plate and or field plate . For one embodiment voltage output of power source may be increased to a second voltage periodically such as after each certain length of time e.g. of about a minute as described above. For example controller may transmit control signal after the particles have collected on field plate and or field plate for the certain length of time.

The energy from the spark excites the atoms of the bulk sample that has been selectively collected on field plate and or field plate . The result is an emission e.g. of light associated with the particles constituting the bulk sample on field plate and or field plate . Such an emission is often called an atomic emission. Emission travels from field plate and or field plate to an optical detector of atomic emission section . Optical detector produces an electronic signal containing information or data such as spectra in response to the specific wavelengths produced from the different elemental emission wavelengths of interest. For one embodiment multiple optical detectors could be used to simultaneously collect spectra on several elements where each of the optical detectors outputs an electrical signal . Each signal is then transmitted to controller for digitization and analysis. For one embodiment controller determines atomic emission properties from the information contained in the one or more signals .

While the drawing illustrates emissions for only plate plate would also have collected particles and would emit atomic emissions. Collection optics of atomic emission section would direct emissions from both plates to one or more detectors .

As indicated above the scattering and fluorescence properties provide an indication of a biological threat. As further indicated above there is a potential for false positives in that some non biological particles have scattering and or fluorescence properties substantially the same as some biological particles. However inorganic compounds such sodium potassium magnesium calcium etc. are typically present in biological particles but are not usually present in non biological particles. Therefore detecting the presence of inorganic compounds in a sample of threat particles is one way of confirming that the sample is likely a sample of biological particles. For one embodiment then controller may determine whether or not the collected particles contain inorganic compounds such sodium potassium magnesium calcium etc. based on the atomic emission properties of the particles of the bulk sample selectively collected on field plate and or field plate .

Note that selectively collecting a sample of threat particles on field plate and or field plate based on the scattering and fluorescence properties of these particles reduces the non biological ambient background signal that would otherwise be produced if non biological were also included in the sample and thereby improves the sensitivity and discrimination of the atomic emission measurements. Moreover obtaining atomic emission data from a selectively collected stationary bulk sample acts to reduce the power requirements and the component complexity associated with atomic emission methods that analyze the particles while they are in motion.

For one embodiment in response to controller determining that the atomic emission properties of the particles based on data contained in the one or more data signals are consistent with atomic emission properties of a known biological agent controller may set an alarm flag. For example controller may set an alarm flag in response to the atomic emission properties of the collected particles being consistent with the atomic emission properties of an inorganic compound typically found in a biological aerosol. For one embodiment when the flag indicates a threat due to the atomic emission properties of the collected particles being consistent with the atomic emission properties of a biological agent and when the scattering and fluorescence properties of the collected particles indicate that a threat exists controller confirms a biological threat by generating an electrical signal and transmits electrical signal to a user interface such as an audible alarm source e.g. a horn and or a visual alarm source e.g. an indicator light indicative of a biological threat. In the event that the atomic emission data is not consistent with the threat it is concluded that there is no threat and no alarm is generated regardless of whether the scattering and fluorescence properties indicate that a threat exists.
