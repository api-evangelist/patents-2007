title: Fully distributed, scalable infrastructure, communication system
abstract: A fully distributed, scalable infrastructure, communication system. The system comprises at least on Space, at least one double agent and at least one non-space specific double agent. Devices and applications that wish to communicate with other members of the Community or outside of the Community insert objects into the Space. The Space then publishes the presence of that object to subscribed members of the community. The double agents are capable of communicating with any desired protocols on one side and the Space protocol on the other. Non-space specific agents handle routing, administrative and other tasks, such as communication between Spaces and Communities.
