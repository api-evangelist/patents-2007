Antibody therapy for cancer often involves the use of antibodies or antibody fragments against a tumor antigen to target antigen expressing cells. Antibodies or antibody fragments may have direct or indirect cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. Direct effects include the induction of apoptosis the blocking of growth factor receptors and anti idiotype antibody formation. Indirect effects include antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC and complement mediated cellular cytotoxicity CDC . When conjugated or fused to cytotoxic moieties the antibodies or fragments thereof provide a method of targeting the cytotoxic moiety towards the tumor antigen expressing cells Green et al. 26 269 286 2000 .

Because antibody therapy typically targets cells expressing a particular antigen there is a possibility of cross reactivity with those normal cells or tissues that express the same or a highly similar antigen. Although some cells such as hematopoietic cells are readily regenerated cross reactivity with many non cancerous cells or tissues can lead to detrimental results. Thus considerable research has focused on identifying tumor specific antigens. Such antigens are found almost exclusively on tumors or are expressed at a greater level in tumor cells than the corresponding normal tissue. Tumor specific antigens provide targets for anti cancer therapies. Antibodies specific to such tumor specific antigens can be conjugated to cytotoxic compounds or can be used alone in immunotherapy. Immunotoxins target cytotoxic compounds to induce cell death. For example anti CD22 antibodies conjugated to deglycosylated ricin A may be used for treatment of B cell lymphoma that has relapsed after conventional therapy Amlot et al. 82 2624 2633 1993 .

Immunotherapy provides a method of harnessing the immune system to treat various pathological states such as cancer autoimmune disease transplant rejection hyperproliferative conditions inflammatory diseases and allergic reactions. The immune system functions to eliminate organisms or cells that are recognized as non self including microorganisms neoplasms and transplants. A cell mediated host response to tumors includes the concept of immunologic surveillance by which cellular mechanisms associated with cell mediated immunity destroy newly transformed tumor cells after recognizing tumor associated antigens i.e. antigens associated with tumor cells that are not apparent on normal cells . Furthermore a humoral response to tumor associated antigens enables destruction of tumor cells through immunological processes triggered by the binding of an antibody to the surface of a cell such as ADCC and CDC.

Recognition of an antigen by the immune system can trigger a cascade of events including cytokine production B cell proliferation and subsequent antibody production. Often tumor cells have reduced capability of presenting antigen to effector cells thus impeding the immune response against a tumor specific antigen. In some instances the tumor specific antigen may not be recognized as non self by the immune system preventing an immune response against the tumor specific antigen from occurring. In such instances stimulation or manipulation of the immune system provides effective techniques of treating cancers expressing one or more tumor specific antigens.

For example rituximab RITUXAN Biogen IDEC Inc. Cambridge Mass. USA is a chimeric antibody directed against CD20 a B cell specific surface molecule found on 95 of B cell non Hodgkin s lymphoma Press et al. 69 584 591 1987 Malony et al. 90 2188 1997 . Rituximab induces ADCC and inhibits cell proliferation through apoptosis in malignant B cells in vitro Maloney et al. Blood 88 637a 1996 . Rituximab is currently used as a therapy for advanced stage or relapsed low grade non Hodgkin s lymphoma which has not responded to conventional therapy.

Several cell surface molecules that participate in B cell and T cell activation are expressed predominantly in several hematologic malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas. A significant number of these molecules such as CD2 and CD48 belong to the immunoglobulin Ig superfamily which is involved in processes such as adhesion migration proliferation differentiation and effector function of leukocytes de la Fuente et al. 90 2398 2405 1997 . In vivo studies have shown that administration of CD2 and CD48 monoclonal antibodies inhibit T cell responses and prolong allograft survival G ckel et al. 174 957 967 1991 Qin et al. 179 341 346 1994 . NTB A a member of the CD2 family is expressed on hematopoietic tissues and cells primarily lymphocytes and monocytes Bottino et al. 194 235 246 2001 U.S. Pat. No. 7 029 677 and may play a role in leukocyte activation. NTB A functions as a co receptor in inducing natural killer NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and its function was significantly affected in the absence of an intracellular signaling protein Src homology 2 domain containing protein Bottino et al. 2001 supra .

Since NTB A is expressed on hematopoietic cells and there is a need to identify new agents that provide therapeutic compositions and diagnostic methods for treating and identifying hematologic malignancies and hyperproliferative disorders compositions that recognize and bind NTB A may be useful for such diagnosis and therapy.

Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer s specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures are as generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. See Sambrook et al. 2d ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 Ausubel et al.

As utilized in accordance with the present disclosure the following terms unless otherwise indicated shall be understood to have the following meanings 

The term polynucleotide as referred to herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases in length either ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA.

The term oligonucleotide referred to herein includes naturally occurring and modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring and non naturally occurring oligonucleotide linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide subset generally comprising a length of 200 bases or fewer. Preferably oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length and most preferably 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 or to 40 bases in length. Oligonucleotides are usually single stranded e.g. for probes although oligonucleotides may be double stranded e.g. for use in the construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides of the invention can be either sense or antisense oligonucleotides.

 Operably linked sequences include both expression control sequences that are contiguous with the gene of interest and expression control sequences that act in trans or at a distance to control the gene of interest. The term expression control sequence as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences which are necessary to effect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which they are ligated. Expression control sequences include appropriate transcription initiation termination promoter and enhancer sequences efficient RNA processing signals such as splicing and polyadenylation signals sequences that stabilize cytoplasmic mRNA sequences that enhance translation efficiency e.g. Kozak consensus sequence sequences that enhance protein stability and when desired sequences that enhance protein secretion. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host organism in prokaryotes such control sequences generally include promoters and transcription termination sequence. The term control sequences as referred to herein includes at a minimum all components whose presence is essential for expression and processing and can also include additional components whose presence is advantageous for example leader sequences and fusion partner sequences.

The term vector as used herein refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply expression vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors e.g. replication defective retroviruses adenoviruses and adeno associated viruses which serve equivalent functions.

The term recombinant host cell or simply host cell as used herein refers to a cell that has been transformed or is capable of being transformed with a nucleic acid sequence and thereby expresses a gene of interest. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences such progeny may not in fact be identical to the parent cell but are still included within the scope of the term host cell as used herein. Host cells may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells that are capable of expressing exogenous nucleic acid sequences. Examples of host cells include bacteria such as yeast plant cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells and insect cells.

The term transduction means the transfer of genes from one bacterium to another usually by bacteriophage. Transduction also refers to the acquisition and transfer of eukaryotic cellular sequences by retroviruses.

The term transfection means the uptake of foreign or exogenous DNA by a cell and a cell has been transfected when the exogenous DNA has been introduced inside the cell membrane. A number of transfection techniques are well known in the art and are disclosed herein. See e.g. Graham et al. 52 456 1973 Sambrook et al. . 2001 Davis et al. Elsevier 1986 and Chu et al. 13 197 1981 . Such techniques can be used to introduce one or more exogenous DNA moieties into suitable host cells.

The term transformation refers to a change in a cell s genetic characteristics and a cell has been transformed when it has been modified to contain new DNA or RNA. For example a cell is transformed wherein it is genetically modified from its native state by introducing new genetic material via transfection transduction or other techniques. Following transfection or transduction the transforming DNA may recombine with that of the cell by physically integrating into a chromosome of the cell or may be maintained transiently as an episomal element without being replicated or may replicate independently as a plasmid. A cell is considered to have been stably transformed when the transforming DNA is replicated with the division of the cell.

The term percent sequence identity in the context of nucleic acid sequences refers to the residues in two sequences which are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence. The length of sequence identity comparison may be over a stretch of at least about nine nucleotides usually at least about 18 nucleotides more usually at least about 24 nucleotides typically at least about 28 nucleotides more typically at least about 32 nucleotides and preferably at least about 36 48 or more nucleotides. There are a number of different algorithms known in the art which can be used to measure nucleotide sequence identity. For instance polynucleotide sequences can be compared using FASTA GAP or BESTFIT which are programs in Wisconsin Package Version 10.0 Genetics Computer Group GCG Madison Wis. FASTA which includes e.g. the programs FASTA2 and FASTA3 provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences Pearson 183 63 98 1990 Pearson 132 185 219 2000 Pearson 266 227 258 1996 Pearson J. Mol. Biol. 276 71 84 1998 herein incorporated by reference . Unless specified otherwise default parameters for a particular program or algorithm are used. For instance percent sequence identity between nucleic acid sequences can be determined using FASTA with its default parameters a word size of 6 and the NOPAM factor for the scoring matrix or using GAP with its default parameters as provided in GCG Version 6.1 herein incorporated by reference.

A reference to a nucleic acid sequence encompasses its complement unless otherwise specified. Thus a reference to a nucleic acid molecule having a particular sequence should be understood to encompass its complementary strand with its complementary sequence.

The term substantial similarity or substantial sequence similarity when referring to a nucleic acid or fragment thereof indicates that when optimally aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions with another nucleic acid or its complementary strand there is nucleotide sequence identity in at least about 85 preferably at least about 90 and more preferably at least about 95 at least 96 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 of the nucleotide bases as measured by any well known algorithm of sequence identity such as FASTA BLAST or GAP as discussed above.

The terms polypeptide or protein means a macromolecule having the amino acid sequence of a native protein that is a protein produced by a naturally occurring and non recombinant cell or produced by a genetically engineered or recombinant cell and comprise molecules having the amino acid sequence of the native protein or molecules having deletions from additions to and or substitutions of one or more amino acids of the native sequence. The terms polypeptide and protein specifically encompass anti NTB A antibodies antigen binding fragments or sequences that have deletions from additions to and or substitutions of one or more amino acid of anti NTB A antibodies or antigen binding fragments. The term polypeptide fragment refers to a polypeptide that has an amino terminal deletion a carboxyl terminal deletion and or an internal deletion as compared with the full length native protein. Such fragments may also contain modified amino acids as compared with the native protein. In certain embodiments fragments are about 5 to 500 amino acids long. For example fragments may be at least 5 6 8 10 14 20 50 70 100 110 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 or 500 amino acids long. Useful polypeptide fragments for this invention include immunologically functional fragments of antibodies including binding domains. In the case of anti NTB A antibodies useful fragments include but are not limited to a CDR region a variable domain of a heavy or light chain a portion of an antibody chain or just its variable region including two CDRs and the like.

The term isolated protein referred to herein means that a subject protein 1 is free of at least some other proteins with which it would normally be found 2 is essentially free of other proteins from the same source e.g. from the same species 3 is expressed by a cell from a different species 4 has been separated from at least about 50 of polynucleotides lipids carbohydrates or other materials with which it is associated in nature 5 is operably associated by covalent or noncovalent interaction with a polypeptide with which it is not associated in nature or 6 does not occur in nature. Genomic DNA cDNA mRNA or other RNA of synthetic origin or any combination thereof may encode such an isolated protein. Preferably the isolated protein is substantially free from proteins or polypeptides or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its therapeutic diagnostic prophylactic research or other use.

A variant of a polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into deleted from and or substituted into the amino acid sequence relative to another polypeptide sequence. Variants of the invention include fusion proteins.

A derivative of a polypeptide is a polypeptide e.g. an antibody that has been chemically modified in some manner distinct from insertion deletion or substitution variants e.g. via conjugation to another chemical moiety.

The term antibody refers to an intact immunoglobulin of any isotype or a fragment thereof that can complete with the intact antibody for specific binding to the target antigen and includes chimeric humanized fully human and bispecific antibodies. An intact antibody generally will comprise at least two full length heavy chains and two full length light chains but in some instances may include fewer chains such as antibodies naturally occurring in camelids which may comprise only heavy chains. Antibodies according to the invention may be derived solely from a single source or may be chimeric that is different portions of the antibody may be derived from two different antibodies. For example the CDR regions may be derived from a rat or murine source while the framework region of the V region is derived from a different animal source such as a human. The antibodies or binding fragments of the invention may be produced in hybridomas by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Unless otherwise indicated the term antibody includes in addition to antibodies comprising two full length heavy chains and two full length light chains derivatives variants fragments and muteins thereof examples of which are described below.

The term light chain includes a full length light chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full length light chain includes a variable region domain abbreviated herein as V and a constant region domain abbreviated herein as C . The variable region domain of the light chain is at the amino terminus of the polypeptide. Light chains according to the invention include kappa chains and lambda chains.

The term heavy chain includes a full length heavy chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full length heavy chain includes a variable region domain abbreviated herein as V and three constant region domains abbreviated herein as C1 C2 and C3 . The Vdomain is at the amino terminus of the polypeptide and the Cdomains are at the carboxy terminus with the C3 being closest to the COOH end. Heavy chains according to the invention may be of any isotype including IgG including IgG IgG IgG and IgGsubtypes IgA including IgAand IgAsubtypes IgM and IgE.

The Vand Vregions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability termed complementarity determining regions or CDR interspersed with regions that are more conserved termed framework regions FR . Each Vand Vis composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino terminus to carboxy terminus in the following order FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3. CDR3 FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors including various cells of the immune system e.g. effector cells and the first component C1q of the classical complement system. An amino acid sequence which is substantially the same as a heavy or light chain CDR exhibits a considerable amount or extent of sequence identity when compared to a reference sequence and contributes favorably to specific binding of an antigen bound specifically by an antibody having the reference sequence. Such identity is definitively known or recognizable as representing the amino acid sequence of the particular human monoclonal antibody. Substantially the same heavy and light chain CDR amino acid sequence can have for example minor modifications or conservative substitutions of amino acids so long as the ability to bind a particular antigen is maintained.

The term CDR or complementarity determining region means the non contiguous antigen combining sites found within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides. This particular region has been described by Kabat et al. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 1983 and by Chothia et al. 196 901 917 1987 and additionally by MacCallum et al. 262 732 745 1996 which are incorporated herein by reference where the definitions include overlapping or subsets of amino acid residues when compared against each other. Nevertheless application of either definition to refer to a CDR of an antibody or functional fragment thereof is intended to be within the scope of the term as defined and used herein. The exact amino acid residue numbers which encompass a particular CDR will vary depending on the structure of the CDR. Those skilled in the art can routinely determine which residues comprise a particular CDR given the variable region amino acid sequence of the antibody. Those skilled in the art can compare two or more antibody sequences by defining regions or individual amino acid positions of the respective sequences with the same CDR definition.

The term antibody includes both glycosylated and non glycosylated immunoglobulins of any isotype or subclass or combination thereof including human including CDR grafted antibodies humanized chimeric multi specific monoclonal polyclonal and oligomers thereof irrespective of whether such antibodies are produced in whole or in part via immunization through recombinant technology by way of in vitro synthetic means or otherwise. Thus the term antibody includes those that are prepared expressed created or isolated by recombinant means such as a antibodies isolated from an animal e.g. a mouse that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma prepared therefrom b antibodies isolated from a host cell transfected to express the antibody c antibodies isolated from a recombinant combinatorial library and d antibodies prepared expressed created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of immunoglobulin gene sequences of two distinct species of animals. In certain embodiments however such antibodies can be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis or when an animal transgenic for human immunoglobulin sequences is used in vivo somatic mutagenesis and thus the amino acid sequences of the Vand Vregions of the antibodies are sequences that while derived from and related to the germline Vand Vsequences of a particular species e.g. human may not naturally exist within that species antibody germline repertoire in vivo.

The term antigen binding fragment of an antibody means one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen e.g. NTB A that is specifically bound by a reference antibody as disclosed herein. An antigen binding fragment of an antibody may include for example polypeptides comprising individual heavy or light chains and fragments thereof such as V V and Fd regions consisting of the Vand C1 domains monovalent fragments such as Fv Fab and Fab regions bivalent fragments such as F ab single chain antibodies such as single chain Fv scFv regions Fc fragments diabodies maxibodies bivalent scFv fused to the amino terminus of the Fc C2 C3 domains and complementary determining region CDR domains. Such terms are described for example in Harlow and Lane Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory NY 1989 Myers R. A. ed. New York VCH Publisher Inc. Huston et al. 22 189 224 1993 Pluckthun and Skerra 178 497 515 1989 and in Day E. D. 2d ed. Wiley Liss Inc. New York N.Y. 1990 which are incorporated herein by reference.

The term antigen binding fragment also includes for example fragments produced by protease digestion or reduction of a human monoclonal antibody and by recombinant DNA methods known to those skilled in the art. One skilled in the art knows that the exact boundaries of a fragment of a human monoclonal antibody can be variable so long as the fragment maintains a functional activity. Using well known recombinant methods one skilled in the art can engineer a nucleic acid to express a functional fragment with any endpoints desired for a particular application. Furthermore although the two domains of the Fv fragment Vand V are coded for by separate genes they can be joined using recombinant methods by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the Vand Vregions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv scFv see e.g. Bird et al. 242 423 426 1988 and Huston et al. 85 5879 5883 1988 . Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term antigen binding fragment of an antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies. Such fragments include those obtained by amino terminal and or carboxy terminal deletions but where the remaining amino acid sequence is substantially identical to the corresponding positions in the naturally occurring sequence deduced for example from a full length cDNA sequence. Antigen binding fragments also include fragments of an antibody which retain at least one e.g. 1 2 3 or more light chain sequences for a particular complementarity determining region CDR e.g. at least one or more of CDR1 CDR2 and or CDR3 from the heavy and or light chain . Fusions of CDR containing sequences to an Fc region or a C2 or C3 region thereof are included within the scope of this definition including for example scFv fused directly or indirectly to an Fc region are included herein. An antigen binding fragment is inclusive of but not limited to those derived from an antibody or fragment thereof e.g. by enzymatic digestion or reduction of disulfide bonds produced synthetically using recombinant methods created via in vitro synthetic means e.g. Merrifield resins combinations thereof or through other methods. Antigen binding fragments may also comprise multiple fragments such as CDR fragments linked together synthetically chemically or otherwise in the form of oligomers. Thus antigen binding fragments of the present invention include polypeptides produced by any number of methods which comprise at least one CDR from a Vor Vchain of the present invention e.g. derived from monoclonal antibodies 480.12 and 994.1 .

The term Vfragment means a fragment of the light chain of a monoclonal antibody which includes all or part of the light chain variable region including the CDRs. A Vfragment can further include light chain constant region sequences.

The term Vfragment means a fragment of the heavy chain of a monoclonal antibody which includes all or part of the heavy chain variable region including the CDRs. A Vfragment can further include heavy chain constant region sequences.

The term Fd fragment means a fragment of the heavy chain of a monoclonal antibody which includes all or part of the Vheavy chain variable region including the CDRs. An Fd fragment can further include C1 heavy chain constant region sequences.

An Fc region contains two heavy chain fragments comprising the C1 and C2 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the C3 domain.

The term Fv fragment means a monovalent antigen binding fragment of a monoclonal antibody including all or part of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains and absent of the constant regions of the heavy and light chains. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains include for example the CDRs.

The term Fab fragment means a monovalent antigen binding fragment of an antibody consisting of the V V Cand C1 domains which is larger than an Fv fragment. For example a Fab fragment includes the variable regions and all or part of the first constant domain of the heavy and light chains.

The term Fab fragment means a monovalent antigen binding fragment of a monoclonal antibody that is larger than a Fab fragment. For example a Fab fragment includes all of the light chain all of the variable region of the heavy chain and all or part of the first and second constant domains of the heavy chain.

The term F ab fragment means a bivalent antigen binding fragment of a monoclonal antibody comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region. An F ab fragment includes for example all or part of the variable regions of two heavy chains and two light chains and can further include all or part of the first constant domains of two heavy chains and two light chains.

 Single chain antibodies are Fv molecules in which the heavy and light chain variable regions have been connected by a flexible linker to form a single polypeptide chain which forms an antigen binding fragment. Single chain antibodies are discussed in detail in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 88 01649 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 946 778 and 5 260 203 the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.

A domain antibody is an antigen binding fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances two or more Vregions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two Vregions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the same or different antigens.

The term bivalent antibody means an antibody that comprises two antigen binding sites. In some instances the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However bivalent antibodies may be bispecific see below .

The term bispecific antibody means an antibody that binds to two or more distinct epitopes. For example the antibody may bind to or interact with a a cell surface antigen and b an Fc receptor on the surface of an effector cell. The term multispecific antibody or heterospecific antibody means an antibody that binds to more than two distinct epitopes. For example the antibody may bind to or interact with a a cell surface antigen b an Fc receptor on the surface of an effector cell and c at least one other component. Accordingly the invention includes but is not limited to bispecific trispecific tetraspecific and other multispecific antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof which are directed to NTB A epitopes and to other targets such as Fc receptors on effector cells. Bispecific antibodies are a species of multispecific antibody and may be produced by a variety of methods including but not limited to fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab fragments. See e.g. Songsivilai and Lachmann 79 315 1990 Kostelny et al. 148 1547 1992 . The two binding sites of a bispecific antibody will bind to two different epitopes which may reside on the same or different protein targets.

The term bispecific antibodies also includes diabodies. Diabodies are bivalent bispecific antibodies in which the Vand Vdomains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites see e.g. Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 Polijak et al. 2 1121 1123 1994 .

The term monoclonal antibody or mAb as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies e.g. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The term is not limited regarding the species or source of the antibody nor is it intended to be limited by the manner in which it is made. The term encompasses whole immunoglobulins as well as fragments such as Fab F ab Fv and other fragments as well as chimeric and humanized homogeneous antibody populations that exhibit immunological binding properties of the parent monoclonal antibody molecule.

The term mouse monoclonal antibody means a monoclonal antibody as defined above produced by immunizing a mouse with an antigen of interest e.g. NTB A . A mouse monoclonal antibody is produced using conventional methods well known in the art from mouse mouse hybridomas described more fully below.

The term rabbit monoclonal antibody as used herein means a monoclonal antibody as defined above produced by immunizing a rabbit with an antigen of interest e.g. NTB A . A rabbit monoclonal antibody can be produced using rabbit rabbit hybridomas e.g. fusions between an antibody producing cell from the immunized rabbit with an immortalized cell from a rabbit rabbit mouse hybridomas e.g. fusions between an antibody producing cell from the immunized rabbit with an immortalized cell from a mouse and the like.

The term human monoclonal antibody means a monoclonal antibody with substantially human CDR amino acid sequences produced for example by recombinant methods by lymphocytes or by hybridoma cells.

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 1984 .

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. See e.g. Jones et al. 321 522 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 1988 Presta 2 593 1992 Vaswani and Hamilton 1 105 1998 Harris 23 1035 1995 Hurle and Gross 5 428 1994 .

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding regions.

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. 10 779 1992 describes affinity maturation by Vand Vdomain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and or framework residues is described by Barbas et al. 91 3809 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 1995 Jackson et al. 154 3310 1995 and Hawkins et al. 226 889 1992 .

 Immunoadhesions or immunoadhesins are antibody like molecules that combine the binding domain of a non antibody polypeptide with the effector functions of an antibody or an antibody constant domain. The binding domain of the non antibody polypeptide can be for example a ligand or cell surface receptor having ligand binding activity. Immunoadhesions for use as anti NTB A antibodies can contain at least the Fc receptor binding effector functions of the antibody constant domain.

 Immunologically reactive means that the antibody of interest will bind with NTB A antigens present in a biological sample.

The term immunogenic sequence of a NTB A means an NTB A molecule that includes an amino acid sequence with at least one epitope such that the molecule is capable of stimulating the production of antibodies in an appropriate host.

The term immunogenic composition means a composition that comprises at least one immunogenic polypeptide e.g. an NTB A antigen or antibody .

The term antigen refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of being bound by a selective binding agent such as an antibody and additionally capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to that antigen. An antigen may possess one or more epitopes that are capable of interacting with different antibodies.

The term selective binding agent refers to a molecule that binds to an antigen. Non limiting examples include antibodies antigen binding fragments scFv Fab Fab F ab single chain antibodies peptides peptide fragments and proteins.

The term epitope includes any determinant capable of binding with high affinity to an immunoglobulin or to a T cell receptor. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody that specifically targets that antigen and when the antigen is a protein includes specific amino acids that directly contact the antibody. Most often epitopes reside on proteins but in some instances may reside on other kinds of molecules such as nucleic acids. Epitope determinants may include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids sugar side chains phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups and may have specific three dimensional structural characteristics and or specific charge characteristics. Generally antibodies specific for a particular target antigen will preferentially recognize an epitope on the target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and or macromolecules.

Regions of a given polypeptide that include an epitope can be identified using any number of epitope mapping techniques well known in the art. See e.g. in Methods in Molecular Biology Vol. 66 Glenn E. Morris Ed. 1996 Humana Press Totowa N.J. For example linear epitopes may be determined by e.g. concurrently synthesizing large numbers of peptides on solid supports the peptides corresponding to portions of the protein molecule and reacting the peptides with antibodies while the peptides are still attached to the supports. Such techniques are known in the art and described in e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 708 871 Geysen et al. 81 3998 4002 1984 Geysen et al. 82 178 182 1985 Geysen et al. 23 709 715 1986 . Similarly conformational epitopes are readily identified by determining spatial conformation of amino acids such as by e.g. x ray crystallography and two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. See e.g. supra. Antigenic regions of proteins can also be identified using standard antigenicity and hydropathy plots such as those calculated using e.g. the Omiga version 1.0 software program available from the Oxford Molecular Group. This computer program employs the Hopp Woods method Hopp et al. 78 3824 3828 1981 for determining antigenicity profiles and the Kyte Doolittle technique Kyte et al. 157 105 132 1982 for hydropathy plots.

An antibody of the invention is said to specifically bind its target antigen when the dissociation constant K is 10M. The antibody specifically binds antigen with high affinity when the Kis 5 10M and with very high affinity when the Kis 5 10M. In one embodiment of the invention the antibody has a Kof 10M and an off rate k of about 1 10 sec. In one embodiment of the invention the off rate is 

The term surface plasmon resonance as used herein refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix for example using the BIAcore system Biacore International AB Uppsala Sweden . For further descriptions see Jonsson et al. 51 19 26 1993 Jonsson et al. 11 620 627 1991 Johnsson et al. 8 125 131 1995 and Johnsson et al. 198 268 277 1991 .

It is understood that the antibodies of the present invention may be modified such that they are substantially identical to the antibody polypeptide sequences or fragments thereof and still bind the NTB A epitopes of the present invention. Polypeptide sequences are substantially identical when optimally aligned using such programs as GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights they share at least 80 sequence identity at least 90 sequence identity at least 95 sequence identity at least 96 sequence identity at least 97 sequence identity at least 98 sequence identity or at least 99 sequence identity.

As discussed herein minor variations in the amino acid sequences of antibodies or antigen binding regions thereof are contemplated as being encompassed by the present invention providing that the variations in the amino acid sequence maintain at least 75 more preferably at least 80 at least 90 at least 95 at least 96 at least 97 at least 98 and most preferably at least 99 sequence identity. In particular conservative amino acid replacements are contemplated. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains. Genetically encoded amino acids are generally divided into families 1 acidic aspartate glutamate 2 basic lysine arginine histidine 3 nonpolar alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan and 4 uncharged polar glycine asparagine glutamine cysteine serine threonine tyrosine . More preferred families are 1 aliphatic hydroxy serine threonine 2 amide containing asparagine glutamine 3 aliphatic alanine valine leucine isoleucine and 4 aromatic phenylalanine tryptophan . For example it is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine an aspartate with a glutamate a threonine with a serine or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on the binding or properties of the resulting molecule especially if the replacement does not involve an amino acid within a framework site. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional peptide can readily be determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide derivative. Assays are described in detail herein. Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred amino and carboxy termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three dimensional structure are known. Bowie et al. 253 164 1991 . Thus the foregoing examples demonstrate that those of skill in the art can recognize sequence motifs and structural conformations that may be used to define structural and functional domains in accordance with the invention.

The antibodies of the present invention may also be generated using peptide analogs of the epitopic determinants disclosed herein which analogs may consist of non peptide compounds having properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non peptide compound are termed peptide mimetics or peptidomimetics . Fauchere 15 29 1986 Veber and Freidinger TINS p. 392 1985 and Evans et al. 30 1229 1987 .

The term immune complex refers the combination formed when an antibody binds to an epitope on an antigen.

The term effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.

A therapeutically effective amount of a substance molecule of the invention may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the individual and the ability of the substance molecule to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance molecule are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.

The term cytotoxic agent as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes e.g. phosphorus 32 copper 67 arsenic 77 rhodium 105 palladium 109 silver 111 tin 121 iodine 125 or 131 holmium 166 lutetium 177 rhenium 186 or 188 iridium 194 gold 199 astatium 211 yttrium 90 samarium 153 or bismuth 212 chemotherapeutic agents e.g. methotrexate adriamicin vinca alkaloids vincristine vinblastine etoposide doxorubicin melphalan mitomycin C chloramucil daunorubicin or other intercalating agents enzymes and fragments thereof such as nucleolytic enzymes antibiotics and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial e.g. toxin endotoxin and exotoxin enterotoxin A fungal e.g. sarcin restrictocin plant e.g. abrin ricin modeccin viscumin pokeweed anti viral protein saporin gelonin momoridin trichosanthin barley toxin or animal origin e.g. cytotoxic RNases such as extracellular pancreatic RNases DNase 1 including fragments and or variants thereof and the various antitumor or anticancer agents disclosed below. Other cytotoxic agents are described below. A tumoricidal agent causes destruction of tumor cells.

The term immunotherapeutic agent is used herein to denote an agent that is an immunopotentiator or an immunosuppressant and is useful for treating diseases and disorders including cancer. Such agents include without limitation various cytokines and lymphokines such as a number of interleukins including IL 1 IL 2 IL 3 IL 4 IL 5 IL 12 and muteins of these molecules interferons such as but not limited to IFN IFN IFN and muteins thereof colony stimulating factors such as GM CSF and muteins of GM CSF tumor necrosis factors such as TNF and TNF and muteins of these molecules. Also captured by the term immunotherapeutic agent are immunotoxins. By immunotoxin is meant an antibody toxin conjugate intended to destroy specific target cells e.g. tumor cells which bear antigens homologous to the antibody. Examples of toxins that are coupled to such antibodies include but are not limited to ricin A chain RTA blocked ricin bIR saporin SAP pokeweed antiviral protein PAP and exotoxin PE and other toxic compounds such as radioisotopes and other chemotherapeutic drugs described further below.

The term immunoconjugate refers to the association of an antibody of the invention with another agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a toxin an immunotherapeutic agent and the like. In this way the agent of interest can be targeted directly to cells bearing the NTB A cell surface antigen. The mode of association between the antibody and the agent of interest is immaterial. Thus the antibody and agent may be associated through non covalent interactions such as through electrostatic forces or by covalent bonds. Various linkers known in the art can be employed in order to form the immunoconjugate. Additionally the immunoconjugate can be provided in the form of a fusion protein that may be expressed from a polynucleotide encoding the immunoconjugate.

As used herein the terms label and detectable label refer to a molecule capable of detection including but not limited to radioactive isotopes fluorescers semiconductor nanocrystals chemiluminescers chromophores enzymes enzyme substrates enzyme cofactors enzyme inhibitors dyes metal ions metal sols ligands e.g. biotin streptavidin or haptens and the like.

The samples detailed above need not necessarily be in the form obtained directly from the source. For example the sample can be treated prior to use such as for example by heating centrifuging etc. prior to analysis.

T cell activation is believed to require at least two distinct signals the first is through the T cell receptor which maintains antigen specificity and the second is via a co stimulatory signal from another receptor such as the SLAM CD150 family of cell surface receptors. The SLAM signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family of cell surface proteins is expressed by lymphoid cells e.g. natural killer NK T and B cells and function in interlymphocyte signaling such as cytokine release in response to stimuli. NTB A also known as SLAM6 is a cell surface receptor and a member of the CD2 superfamily of co receptors most closely related to members of the SLAM subfamily Bottino et al. 2001 supra . NTB A is characterized by an extracellular region containing two immunoglobulin Ig like domains a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic domain containing three ITAM motifs immune tyrosine based activating motif TXYXX V I SEQ ID NO 22 . NTB A is expressed by resting and activated lymphoid cells including NK cells T and B lymphocytes and has been implicated in signaling events in both T and NK cells. Monoclonal antibodies raised against NTB A have been shown to facilitate T cell activation while acting as a co receptor for CD3 and triggering of NTB A leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of SLAM associated protein SAP Valdez et al. 279 18662 18669 2004 Veillette 6 56 66 2006 . Like other members of the subfamily NTB A can act as its own ligand and it has been reported that homophilic interaction can alter NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity Falco et al. 34 1663 1672 2004 Stark and Watzl 18 241 247 2006 .

As described in the Examples below NTB A was shown to be expressed in normal lymphocytes but not in other solid tissues or in CD34 progenitor cells. However B cell malignancies including Non Hodgkin s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL express NTB A indicating that NTB A may be useful as an immunotherapeutic target for diseases or disorders related to NTB A activity.

In order to further an understanding of the invention a more detailed discussion is provided below regarding the NTB A cell surface antigen antibodies directed against this antigen chemotherapeutic agents and toxins compositions and diagnostic methods.

A variety of selective binding agents useful for regulating the activity of NTB A are provided. These agents include for instance antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof that contain an antigen binding domain e.g. single chain antibodies domain antibodies immunoadhesins and polypeptides with an antigen binding region that specifically bind to an NTB A polypeptide e.g. a human rat and or murine NTB A polypeptide .

The present invention provides isolated anti NTB A antibodies that bind to human NTB A epitopes. In a preferred embodiment the NTB A epitope is substantially the same epitope as a human NTB A epitope defined by amino acids 95 to 124 of SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 17 . In another embodiment the present invention provides isolated anti NTB A antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof that bind to a human NTB A epitope or substantially the same epitope defined by amino acids 95 to 124 of SEQ ID NO 2. In another embodiment the present invention provides an isolated antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to a human NTB A epitope or substantially the same epitope defined by amino acids 95 to 124 of SEQ ID NO 2. In another embodiment the present invention provides a monoclonal antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to a human NTB A epitope or substantially the same epitope defined by amino acids 95 to 124 of SEQ ID NO 2. Such antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof can be prepared by any one of a number of processes disclosed below for example by immunizing an animal with at least a first NTB A antigenic composition and selecting from the immunized animal an antibody that substantially cross reacts with the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention.

Some of the antibodies and antigen binding fragments that are provided include a one or more light chain LC complementary determining regions CDRs selected from the group consisting of 

Such antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof can specifically bind an NTB A polypeptide. Certain antibodies or fragments include one two three four five or six of the foregoing CDRs. In a particular embodiment the CDRs are arranged as in monoclonal antibodies 480.12 or 994.1.

The light chain and heavy chains of other antibodies or fragments are as described above but have at least 90 sequence identity to the foregoing sequences. Still other antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof are ones having a light chain in which CDR1 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 27 CDR2 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 28 and or CDR3 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 29. Still other antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof are ones having a light chain in which CDR1 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 33 CDR2 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 34 and or CDR3 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 35. Some antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof may also have a heavy chain in which CDR1 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 24 CDR2 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 25 and or CDR3 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 26. Some antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof may also have a heavy chain in which CDR1 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 30 CDR2 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 31 and or CDR3 has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO 32.

The antibodies encompassed by the present invention include IgG IgA IgG IgE IgM and IgD antibodies. In a preferred embodiment the antibody is an IgG and is an IgG IgG IgG or IgGsubtype. In a particular embodiment the antibody of the present invention is an IgGb isotype. In another preferred embodiment the anti NTB A antibody is the same class and subclass as antibody 480.12 or 994.1 which is IgGb. In yet a further embodiment the anti NTB A antibody is the same class and subclass as chimeric monoclonal antibody 480.12 77 or 994.1 9 which is IgG.

The class and subclass of anti NTB A antibodies may be identified by any method known in the art. In general the class and subclass of an antibody may be identified using antibodies that are specific for a particular class and subclass of antibody. Such antibodies are available commercially. The class and subclass can be determined by ELISA Western blot as well as other techniques. Alternatively the class and subclass may be determined by sequencing all or a portion of the constant domains of the heavy and or light chains of the antibodies comparing their amino acid sequences to the known amino acid sequences of various classes and subclasses of immunoglobulins and determining the class and subclass of the antibodies.

In another aspect of the invention the anti NTB A antibody demonstrates both species and molecule selectivity. In one embodiment the anti NTB A antibody binds to human cynomologous rhesus or chimpanzee NTB A. Following the teachings of the specification one may determine the species selectivity for the anti NTB A antibody using methods well known in the art. For instance one may determine species selectivity using Western blot FACS ELISA or RIA.

Some of the selective binding agents that are provided have the structure typically associated with naturally occurring antibodies. The structural units of these antibodies typically comprise one or more tetramers each composed of two identical couplets of polypeptide chains though some species of mammals also produce antibodies having only a single heavy chain. In a typical antibody each pair or couplet includes one full length light chain in certain embodiments about 25 kD and one full length heavy chain in certain embodiments about 50 70 kD . Each individual immunoglobulin chain is composed of several immunoglobulin Ig domains each consisting of roughly 90 to 110 amino acids and expressing a characteristic folding pattern. These domains are the basic units of which antibody polypeptides are composed. The amino terminal portion of each chain typically includes a variable domain that is responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy terminal portion is more conserved evolutionarily than the other end of the chain and is referred to as the constant region or C region . Human light chains generally are classified as kappa and lambda light chains and each of these contains one variable domain and one constant domain. Heavy chains are typically classified as mu delta gamma alpha or epsilon chains and these define the antibody s isotype as IgM IgD IgG IgA and IgE respectively. IgG has several subtypes including but not limited to IgG IgG IgG and IgG. IgM subtypes include IgMand IgM. IgA subtypes include IgAand IgA. In humans the IgA and IgD isotypes contain four heavy chains and four light chains the IgG and IgE isotypes contain two heavy chains and two light chains and the IgM isotype contains five heavy chains and five light chains. The heavy chain C region typically comprises one or more domains that may be responsible for effector function. The number of heavy chain constant region domains will depend on the isotype. IgG heavy chains for example each contain three C region domains known as C1 C2 and C3. The antibodies that are provided can have any of these isotypes and subtypes. In certain embodiments of the invention the anti NTB A antibodies are of the IgGor IgGb subtypes.

In full length light and heavy chains the variable and constant regions are joined by a J region of about 12 or more amino acids with the heavy chain also including a D region of about 10 or more amino acids. See e.g. 2ed. Ch. 7 Paul W. ed 1989 New York Raven Press herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes . The variable regions of each light heavy chain pair typically form the antigen binding site.

Variable regions of immunoglobulin chains generally exhibit the same overall structure comprising relatively conserved framework regions FR joined by three hypervariable regions more often called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each heavy chain light chain pair mentioned above typically are aligned by the framework regions to form a structure that binds specifically with a specific epitope on the target protein e.g. NTB A . From N terminal to C terminal naturally occurring light and heavy chain variable regions both typically conform to the following order of these elements FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 and FR4. A numbering system has been devised for assigning numbers to amino acids that occupy positions in each of these domains. This numbering system is defined in Kabat et al. 1991 National Institutes of Health Publication No. 91 3242 5th ed. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Bethesda Md. or Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 Chothia et al. 342 878 883 1989 .

As a specific example of such antibodies in one embodiment the anti NTB A antibody is a monoclonal antibody derived from mice. Exemplary antibodies capable of binding to the aforementioned epitope are the monoclonal antibodies 480.12 and 994.1 and chimeric monoclonal antibodies 480.12 77 and 994.1 9 see Examples below each of which comprises a light chain and a heavy chain.

Antibodies of this type can generally be designated by the formula VxVy wherein x is the number of the light chain variable region and y corresponds to the number of the heavy chain variable region as listed in Table 1. In general x and y are each 1 or 2.

Thus V2V1 refers to an antibody with a light chain variable region domain comprising the amino acid sequence of V2 and a heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of V1. The antibodies that are provided thus include but are not limited to those having the following form V1V1 V1V2 V2V1 and V2V2.

The light chain variable region in some antibodies comprises a sequence of amino acids that has at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 at least 96 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 sequence identity to the amino acid sequences of the light chain variable regions of V1 or V2.

Some antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof that are provided comprise a heavy chain variable domain comprising a sequence of amino acids that differs from the sequence of a heavy chain variable domain selected from V1 and V2 only at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 or 15 amino acid residues wherein each such sequence difference is independently either a deletion insertion or substitution of one amino acid. The heavy chain variable region in some antibodies comprises a sequence of amino acids that has at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 at least 96 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 sequence identity to the amino acid sequences of the heavy chain variable region of V1 or V2. Still other antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof include variant forms of a variant light chain and a variant heavy chain as just described.

Complementarity determining regions CDRs and framework regions FR of a given antibody may be identified using the system described by Kabat et al. 1991 supra. Certain antibodies that are disclosed herein comprise one or more amino acid sequences that are identical or have substantial sequence identity to the amino acid sequences of one or more of the CDRs as summarized in Table 2.

Certain antibodies have variant forms of the CDRs listed in Table 2 with one or more e.g. 2 3 4 5 or 6 of the CDRs each having at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 at least 96 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 sequence identity to a CDR sequence listed in Table 2. For example the antibody or antigen binding region can include both a light chain CDR3 and a heavy chain CDR3 that each have at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 at least 96 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 sequence identity to the light chain CDR3 and heavy chain CDR3 respectively listed in Table 2. The invention also provides for antibodies that have CDR sequences that differ from the CDR sequences listed in Table 2 such that the amino acid sequence for any given CDR differs from the sequence listed in Table 2 by no more than 1 2 3 4 or 5 amino acid residues.

Certain antibodies that are disclosed herein comprise one or more amino acid sequences that comprise one or more CDRs that begin at least one amino acid before N terminal to the beginning amino acid of the CDRs as summarized in Table 2. Yet other antibodies that are disclosed herein comprise one or more amino acid sequences that comprise one or more CDRs that begin at least two at least three or at least four amino acids before N terminal to the beginning amino acid of the CDRs as summarized in Table 2.

Other antibodies disclosed herein comprise one or more amino acid sequences that comprise a combination of one or more CDRs with one two three or four amino acid differences at the start and or stop of the CDRs as summarized in Table 2.

Polypeptides comprising one or more of the light or heavy chain CDRs may be produced by using a suitable vector to express the polypeptides in a suitable host cell as described in greater detail below.

The heavy and light chain variable regions and the CDRs that are disclosed in Tables 1 and 2 can be used to prepare any of the various types of antigen binding fragments that are known in the art including but not limited to domain antibodies Fab fragments Fab fragments F ab fragments Fv fragments single chain antibodies and scFvs.

When an antibody is said to bind an epitope within specified residues such as NTB A for example what is meant is that the antibody binds with high affinity to a polypeptide consisting of the specified residues e.g. a specified segment of NTB A . Such an antibody does not necessarily contact every residue within NTB A. Nor does every single amino acid substitution or deletion within NTB A necessarily significantly affect binding affinity. Epitope specificity of an antibody can be determined in a variety of ways. One approach for example involves testing a collection of overlapping peptides of about 15 amino acids spanning the sequence of NTB A and differing in increments of a small number of amino acids e.g. 3 to 30 amino acids . The peptides are immobilized in separate wells of a microtiter dish. Immobilization can be effected by biotinylating one terminus of the peptides. Optionally different samples of the same peptide can be biotinylated at the N and C terminus and immobilized in separate wells for purposes of comparison. This is useful for identifying end specific antibodies. Optionally additional peptides can be included terminating at a particular amino acid of interest. This approach is useful for identifying end specific antibodies to internal fragments of NTB A. An antibody or antigen binding fragment is screened for binding to each of the various peptides. The epitope is defined as occurring with a segment of amino acids that is common to all peptides to which the antibody shows high affinity binding. Details regarding a specific approach for defining an epitope are set forth in Example 4.

Antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof that bind to an epitope that is located in the carboxy terminal portion of the first Ig domain of NTB A e.g. SEQ ID NO 17 see are also provided. Exemplary antibodies capable of binding to the aforementioned epitope are the monoclonal antibodies 480.12 and 994.1 and chimeric monoclonal antibodies 480.12 77 and 994.1 9 each of which comprise a light chain and a heavy chain.

In one aspect of the invention peptides comprising or consisting of amino acids 22 to 184 of SEQ ID NO 2 e.g. SEQ ID NO 12 are provided. Other peptides comprise or consist of amino acids 22 to 154 of SEQ ID NO 2 e.g. SEQ ID NO 13 are provided. Still other peptides that are provided comprise or consist of amino acids 22 to 124 of SEQ ID NO 2 e.g. SEQ ID NO 14 . Other peptides that are provided comprise or consist of amino acids 95 to 124 of SEQ ID NO 2 e.g. SEQ ID NO 17 . Such peptides are shorter than the full length protein sequence of a native NTB A e.g. the peptides may include one or more of the forgoing regions and be 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 20 21 22 23 24 25 30 40 50 75 100 150 or 200 amino acids in length . These peptides may be fused to another peptide to increase immunogenicity and thus be in the form of a fusion protein.

The antibodies that are provided include monoclonal antibodies that bind to NTB A. Monoclonal antibodies may be produced using any technique known in the art e.g. by immortalizing spleen cells harvested from a transgenic or non transgenic animal after completion of the immunization schedule. The spleen cells can be immortalized using any technique known in the art e.g. by fusing them with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. Myeloma cells for use in hybridoma producing fusion procedures preferably are non antibody producing have high fusion efficiency and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells hybridomas . Examples of suitable cell lines for use in mouse fusions include Sp 20 P3 X63 Ag8 P3 X63 Ag8.653 NS1 1.Ag41 Sp210 Ag14 FO NSO U MPC 11 MPC11 X45 GTG 1.7 and S194 5XXO Bul examples of cell lines used in rat fusions include R210.RCY3 Y3 Ag1.2.3 1R983F and 4B210. Other cell lines useful for cell fusions are U 266 GM1500 GRG2 LICR LON HMy2 and UC729 6.

In some instances a hybridoma cell line is produced by immunizing an animal e.g. a transgenic animal having human immunoglobulin sequences with an NTB A immunogen harvesting spleen cells from the immunized animal fusing the harvested spleen cells to a myeloma cell line thereby generating hybridoma cells establishing hybridoma cell lines from the hybridoma cells and identifying a hybridoma cell line that produces an antibody that binds a NTB A polypeptide. Such hybridoma cell lines and anti NTB A monoclonal antibodies produced by them are encompassed by the present invention.

Monoclonal antibodies secreted by a hybridoma cell line can be purified using any technique known in the art. Hybridomas or mAbs may be further screened to identify mAbs with particular properties such as blocking NTB A activity or inducing cell killing through ADCC or CMC.

Chimeric and humanized antibodies based upon the foregoing sequences are also provided. Monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutic agents may be modified in various ways prior to use. One example is a chimeric antibody which is an antibody composed of protein segments from different antibodies that are covalently joined to produce functional immunoglobulin light or heavy chains or antigen binding fragments thereof. Generally a portion of the heavy chain and or light chain is identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is are identical or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. For methods relating to chimeric antibodies see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1985 which are hereby incorporated by reference. CDR grafting is described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 180 370 5 693 762 5 693 761 5 585 089 and 5 530 101 which are all hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.

Generally the goal of making a chimeric antibody is to create a chimera in which the number of amino acids from the intended patent species is maximized. One example is the CDR grafted antibody in which the antibody comprises one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the antibody chain s is are identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. For use in humans the V region or selected CDRs from a rodent antibody often are grafted into a human antibody replacing the naturally occurring V regions or CDRs of the human antibody.

One useful type of chimeric antibody is a humanized antibody. Generally a humanized antibody is produced from a monoclonal antibody raised initially in a non human animal. Certain amino acid residues in this monoclonal antibody typically from non antigen recognizing portions of the antibody are modified to be homologous to corresponding residues in a human antibody or corresponding isotype. Preferably anti NTB A humanized antibodies contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin sequences. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 225 539 5 585 089 5 693 761 5 693 762 5 859 205. In some instances framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 585 089 5 693 761 5 693 762 . Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance e.g. to obtain desired affinity . In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 331 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 36 1988 .

In one aspect of the invention the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions of the antibodies provided herein see Table 2 are grafted to framework regions FRs from antibodies from the same or a different phylogenetic species. For example the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions of the 480.12 antibody can be grafted to consensus human FRs. To create consensus human FRs FRs from several human heavy chain or light chain amino acid sequences may be aligned to identify a consensus amino acid sequence. In other embodiments the FRs of the 480.12 antibody heavy or light chain are replaced with the FRs from a different heavy chain or light chain. In one aspect of the invention rare amino acids in the FRs of the heavy and light chains of anti NTB A antibody are not replaced while the rest of the FR amino acids are replaced. A rare amino acid is a specific amino acid that is in a position in which this particular amino acid is not usually found in an FR. Alternatively the grafted variable regions from the 480.12 antibody may be used with a constant region that is different from the constant region of 480.12. In another aspect of this embodiment the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions of the 994.1 antibody can be used. In other embodiments of the invention the grafted variable regions are part of a single chain Fv antibody.

In certain embodiments constant regions from species other than human can be used along with the human variable region s to produce hybrid antibodies.

Also encompassed are xenogeneic or modified anti NTB A antibodies produced in a non human mammalian host more particularly a transgenic mouse characterized by inactivated endogenous immunoglobulin Ig loci. In such transgenic animals competent endogenous genes for the expression of light and heavy subunits of host immunoglobulins are rendered non functional and substituted with the analogous human immunoglobulin loci. These transgenic animals produce human antibodies in the substantial absence of light or heavy host immunoglobulin subunits. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 939 598.

Antibody fragments that retain the ability to recognize the antigen of interest will also find use herein. A number of antibody fragments are known in the art which comprise antigen binding sites capable of exhibiting immunological binding properties of an intact antibody molecule. For example functional antibody fragments can be produced by cleaving a constant region not responsible for antigen binding from the antibody molecule using e.g. pepsin to produce F ab fragments. These fragments can contain two antigen binding sites but lack a portion of the constant region from each of the heavy chains. Similarly if desired Fab fragments comprising a single antigen binding site can be produced e.g. by digestion of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with papain. Functional fragments including only the variable regions of the heavy and light chains can also be produced using standard techniques such as recombinant production or preferential proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules. These fragments are known as Fv. See e.g. Inbar et al. 69 2659 2662 1972 Hochman et al. 15 2706 2710 1976 and Ehrlich et al. 19 4091 4096 1980 .

A phage display system can be used to expand antibody molecule populations in vitro. Saiki et al. 324 163 1986 Scharf et al. 233 1076 1986 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 683 195 and 4 683 202 Yang et al. 254 392 1995 Barbas III et al. . 1995 8 94 Barbas III et al. 88 7978 1991 .

Once generated the phage display library can be used to improve the immunological binding affinity of the Fab molecules using known techniques. See e.g. Figini et al. 239 68 1994 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chain portions of the Fab molecules selected from the phage display library can be isolated or synthesized and cloned into any suitable vector or replicon for expression. Any suitable expression system can be used including those described above.

Single chain antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. A single chain Fv sFv or scFv polypeptide is a covalently linked V Vheterodimer which is expressed from a gene fusion including V and V encoding genes linked by a peptide encoding linker. Huston et al. 85 5879 5883 1988 . A number of methods have been described to discern and develop chemical structures linkers for converting the naturally aggregated but chemically separated light and heavy polypeptide chains from an antibody V region into an scFv molecule which will fold into a three dimensional structure substantially similar to the structure of an antigen binding site. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 091 513 5 132 405 and 4 946 778. The scFv molecules may be produced using methods described in the art. See e.g. Huston et al. 85 5879 5883 1988 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 091 513 5 132 405 and 4 946 778. Design criteria include determining the appropriate length to span the distance between the C terminus of one chain and the N terminus of the other wherein the linker is generally formed from small hydrophilic amino acid residues that do not tend to coil or form secondary structures. Such methods have been described in the art and are well known. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 091 513 5 132 405 and 4 946 778. Suitable linkers generally comprise polypeptide chains of alternating sets of glycine and serine residues and may include glutamic acid and lysine residues inserted to enhance solubility.

 Mini antibodies or minibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Minibodies are scFv polypeptide chains that include oligomerization domains at their C termini separated from the sFv by a hinge region. Pack et al. Biochem. 31 1579 1584 1992 . The oligomerization domain comprises self associating helices e.g. leucine zippers that can be further stabilized by additional disulfide bonds. The oligomerization domain is designed to be compatible with vectorial folding across a membrane a process thought to facilitate in vivo folding of the polypeptide into a functional binding protein. Generally minibodies are produced using recombinant methods well known in the art. See e.g. Pack et al. 31 1579 1584 1992 Cumber et al. 149B 120 126 1992 .

Fully human antibodies are also provided. Methods are available for making fully human antibodies specific for a given antigen without exposing human beings to the antigen fully human antibodies . One means for implementing the production of fully human antibodies is the humanization of the mouse humoral immune system. Introduction of human immunoglobulin Ig loci into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated is one means of producing fully human monoclonal antibodies mAbs in mouse an animal that can be immunized with any desirable antigen. Using fully human antibodies can minimize the immunogenic and allergic responses that can sometimes be caused by administering mouse or mouse derivatized mAbs to humans as therapeutic agents.

In one embodiment human antibodies may be produced in a non human transgenic animal e.g. a transgenic mouse capable of producing multiple isotypes of human antibodies to NTB A e.g. IgG IgA and or IgE by undergoing V D J recombination and isotype switching. Accordingly aspects of the invention include not only antibodies antibody fragments and pharmaceutical compositions thereof but also non human transgenic animals B cells host cells and hybridomas which produce anti NTB A monoclonal antibodies. Methods of using the antibodies of the invention to detect a cell expressing NTB A either in vivo or in vitro are also encompassed by the invention. The present invention further encompasses pharmaceutical preparations containing the antibodies of the present invention and methods of treating physiological disorders e.g. hematopoietic based cancers by administering the antibodies of the present invention.

Fully human antibodies can be produced by immunizing transgenic animals usually mice that are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. Antigens for this purpose typically have six or more contiguous amino acids and optionally are conjugated to a carrier such as a hapten. See for example Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 2555 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 . In one example of such a method transgenic animals are produced by incapacitating the endogenous mouse immunoglobulin loci encoding the mouse heavy and light immunoglobulin chains therein and inserting into the mouse genome large fragments of human genome DNA containing loci that encode human heavy and light chain proteins. Partially modified animals which have less than the full complement of human immunoglobulin loci are then cross bred to obtain an animal having all of the desired immune system modifications. When administered an immunogen these transgenic animals produce antibodies that are immunospecific for the immunogen but have human rather than murine amino acid sequences including the variable regions. For further details of such methods see for example International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 96 33735 and WO 94 02602 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Additional methods relating to transgenic mice for making human antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 807 6 713 610 6 673 986 6 162 963 6 300 129 6 255 458 5 877 397 5 874 299 and 5 545 806 in International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 91 10741 and WO 90 04036 and in European Patent Nos. EP 546073B1 and EP 546073A1 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

The transgenic mice described above referred to herein as HuMAb mice contain a human immunoglobulin gene minilocus that encodes unrearranged human heavy and and light chain immunoglobulin sequences together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous and chain loci Lonberg et al. 368 856 859 1994 . Accordingly the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or chains and in response to immunization the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgG monoclonal antibodies Lonberg et al. supra Lonberg and Huszar 13 65 93 1995 Harding and Lonberg 764 536 546 1995 . The preparation of HuMAb mice is described in detail in Taylor et al. 20 6287 6295 1992 Chen et al. 5 647 656 1993 Tuaillon et al. 152 2912 2920 1994 Lonberg et al. supra Lonberg 113 49 101 1994 Taylor et al. 6 579 591 1994 Lonberg and Huszar 13 65 93 1995 Harding and Lonberg 764 536 546 1995 Fishwild et al. 14 845 851 1996 the foregoing references are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

For example the HCo7 and HCo12 transgenic mice strains can be used to generate human anti NTB A antibodies.

Using hybridoma technology antigen specific human mAbs with the desired specificity can be produced and selected from the transgenic mice such as those described above. Such antibodies may be cloned and expressed using a suitable vector and host cell or the antibodies can be harvested from cultured hybridoma cells.

Fully human antibodies can also be derived from phage display libraries as disclosed in Hoogenboom et al. 227 381 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 1991 . Phage display techniques mimic immune selection through the display of antibody repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to an antigen of choice. One such technique is described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 99 10494 herein incorporated by reference which describes the isolation of high affinity and functional agonistic antibodies for MPL and msk receptors using such an approach.

The antibodies that are provided also include bispecific and bifunctional antibodies that include one or more CDRs or one or more variable regions as described above. A bispecific or bifunctional antibody in some instances is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies may be produced by a variety of methods including but not limited to fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab fragments. See e.g. Songsivilai and Lachmann 79 315 321 1990 Kostelny et al. 148 1547 1553 1992 .

Some of the antibodies or antigen binding fragments that are provided are variant forms of the antibodies and fragments disclosed above e.g. those having the sequences listed in Tables 1 and 2 . For instance some of the antibodies or antigen binding fragments are ones having one or more conservative amino acid substitutions in one or more of the heavy or light chains variable regions or CDRs listed in Tables 1 and 2.

Conservative amino acid substitutions may involve exchange of a member of one of these classes with another member of the same class. Conservative amino acid substitutions may encompass non naturally occurring amino acid residues which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.

Non conservative substitutions may involve the exchange of a member of one of the classes for a member from another class. Such substituted residues may be introduced into regions of the antibody that are homologous with human antibodies or into the non homologous regions of the molecule.

In making such changes according to certain embodiments the hydropathic profile of a protein is calculated by assigning each amino acid a numerical value hydropathy index and then repetitively averaging these values along the peptide chain. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. They are isoleucine 4.5 valine 4.2 leucine 3.8 phenylalanine 2.8 cysteine cysteine 2.5 methionine 1.9 alanine 1.8 glycine 0.4 threonine 0.7 serine 0.8 tryptophan 0.9 tyrosine 1.3 proline 1.6 histidine 3.2 glutamate 3.5 glutamine 3.5 aspartate 3.5 asparagine 3.5 lysine 3.9 and arginine 4.5 .

The importance of the hydropathic profile in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is understood in the art see for example Kyte et al. 157 105 131 1982 . It is known that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acid shaving a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index in certain embodiments the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within 2 is included. In some aspects of the invention those which are within 1 are included and in other aspects of the invention those within 0.5 are included .

It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity particularly where the biologically functional protein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immunological embodiments as in the present case. In certain embodiments the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids correlates with its immunogenicity and antigen binding that is with a biological property of the protein.

The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues arginine 3.0 lysine 3.0 aspartate 3.0 1 glutamate 3.0 1 serine 0.3 asparagine 0.2 glutamine 0.2 glycine 0 threonine 0.4 proline 0.5 1 alanine 0.5 histidine 0.5 cysteine 1.0 methionine 1.3 valine 1.5 leucine 1.8 isoleucine 1.8 tyrosine 2.3 phenylalanine 2.5 and tryptophan 3.4 . In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values in certain embodiments the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within 2 are included in other embodiments whose which are within 1 are included and in still other embodiments those within 0.5 are included. In some instances one may also identify epitopes from primary amino acid sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity. These regions are also referred to as epitopic core regions. 

A skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable variants of polypeptides as set forth herein using well known techniques. One skilled in the art may identify suitable areas of the molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. The skilled artisan also will be able to identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides. In further embodiments even areas that may be important for biological activity or for structure may be subject to conservative amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological activity or without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure.

Additionally one skilled in the art can review structure function studies identifying residues in similar polypeptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison one can predict the importance of amino acid residues in a protein that correspond to amino acid residues important for activity or structure in similar proteins. One skilled in the art may opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such predicted important amino acid residues.

One skilled in the art can also analyze the three dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar polypeptides. In view of such information one skilled in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. One skilled in the art may choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein since such residues may be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover one skilled in the art may generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. These variants can then be screened using assays for NTB A binding ADCC and or CMC activity see Examples below thus yielding information gathered from such routine experiments one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acid positions where further substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other mutations.

A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See Moult 7 422 427 1996 Chou et al. 13 222 245 1974 Chou et al. 13 211 222 1974 Chou et al. 47 45 148 1978 Chou et al. 47 251 276 1979 and Chou et al. 26 367 384 1979 . Moreover computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example two polypeptides or proteins that have a sequence identity of greater than 30 or similarity of greater than 40 often have similar structural topologies. The growth of the protein structural database PDB has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide s or protein s structure. See Holm et al. 27 244 247 1999 . It has been suggested Brenner et al. 7 369 376 1997 that there are a limited number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate.

Additional methods of predicting secondary structure include threading Jones 7 377 87 1997 Sippl et al. 4 15 19 1996 profile analysis Bowie et al. 253 164 170 1991 Gribskov et al. 84 4355 4358 1987 and evolutionary linkage See Holm 1999 supra and Brenner 1997 supra .

In some embodiments of the invention amino acid substitutions are made that 1 reduce susceptibility to proteolysis 2 reduce susceptibility to oxidation 3 alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes 4 alter ligand or antigen binding affinities and or 5 confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties on such polypeptides. For example single or multiple amino acid substitutions in certain embodiments conservative amino acid substitutions may be made in the naturally occurring sequence. Substitutions can be made in that portion of the antibody that lies outside the domain s forming intermolecular contacts. In such embodiments conservative amino acid substitutions can be used that do not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence e.g. one or more replacement amino acids that do not disrupt the secondary structure that characterizes the parent or native antibody . Examples of art recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Creighton Ed. 1984 W.H. New York Freeman and Company Brandon and Tooze eds. 1991 New York Garland Publishing and Thornton et al. 354 105 1991 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The invention also encompasses glycosylation variants of the inventive antibodies wherein the number and or type of glycosylation site s has been altered compared to the amino acid sequences of the parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments antibody protein variants comprise a greater or a lesser number of N linked glycosylation sites than the native antibody. An N linked glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence Asn X Ser or Asn X Thr wherein the amino acid residue designated as X may be any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively substitutions that eliminate or alter this sequence will prevent addition of an N linked carbohydrate chain present in the native polypeptide. For example the glycosylation can be reduced by the deletion of an Asn or by substituting the Asn with a different amino acid. In other embodiments one or more new N linked glycosylation sites are created. Antibodies typically have a N linked glycosylation site in the Fc region.

Additional preferred antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues in the parent or native amino acid sequence are deleted from or substituted with another amino acid e.g. serine . Cysteine variants are useful inter alia when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation. Cysteine variants may have fewer cysteine residues than the native antibody and typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.

The heavy and light chains variable region domains and CDRs that are disclosed can be used to prepare polypeptides that contain an antigen binding fragment that can specifically bind to a NTB A molecule. For example one or more of the CDRs listed in Table 2 can be incorporated into a molecule e.g. a polypeptide covalently or noncovalently to make an immunoadhesion. An immunoadhesion may incorporate the CDR s as part of a larger polypeptide chain may covalently link the CDR s to another polypeptide chain or may incorporate the CDR s noncovalently. The CDR s enable the immunoadhesion to bind specifically to a particular antigen of interest e.g. an NTB A polypeptide or epitope thereof .

Mimetics e.g. peptide mimetics or peptidomimetics based upon the variable region domains and CDRs that are described herein are also provided. These analogs can be peptides non peptides or combinations of peptide and non peptide regions. Fauchere 15 29 1986 Veber and Freidiner p. 392 1985 and Evans et al. 30 1229 1987 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for any purpose. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce a similar therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Generally peptidomimetics of the invention are proteins that are structurally similar to an antibody displaying a desired biological activity such as the ability to bind NTB A but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from 

 CHNH CHS CH CH CH CH cis and trans COCH CH OH CH and CHSO by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D amino acid of the same type e.g. D lysine in place of L lysine may be used in certain embodiments of the invention to generate more stable proteins. In addition constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art Rizo and Gierasch 61 387 1992 incorporated herein by reference for example by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.

Derivatives of the antibodies and antigen binding fragments that are described herein are also provided. The derivatized antibody or fragment may comprise any molecule or substance that imparts a desired property to the antibody or fragment such as increased half life in a particular use. The derivatized antibody can comprise for example a detectable or labeling moiety e.g. a radioactive calorimetric antigenic or enzymatic molecule a detectable bead such as a magnetic or electrodense e.g. gold bead or a molecule that binds to another molecule e.g. biotin or streptavidin a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety e.g. a radioactive cytotoxic or pharmaceutically active moiety or a molecule that increases the suitability of the antibody for a particular use e.g. administration to a subject such as a human subject or other in vivo or in vitro uses . Examples of molecules that can be used to derivatize an antibody include albumin e.g. human serum albumin and polyethylene glycol PEG . Albumin linked and PEGylated derivatives of antibodies can be prepared using techniques well known in the art. In one embodiment the antibody is conjugated or otherwise linked to transthyretin TTR or a TTR variant. The TTR or TTR variant can be chemically modified with for example a chemical selected from the group consisting of dextran poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycols propropylene glycol homopolymers polypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols and polyvinyl alcohols.

Other derivatives include covalent or aggregative conjugates of anti NTB A antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof with other proteins or polypeptides such as by expression of recombinant fusion proteins comprising heterologous polypeptides fused to the N terminus or C terminus of an anti NTB A antibody polypeptide. For example the conjugated peptide may be a heterologous signal or leader polypeptide e.g. the yeast alpha factor leader or a peptide such as an epitope tag e.g. V5 His . Anti NTB A antibody containing fusion proteins can comprise peptides added to facilitate purification or identification of the anti NTB A antibody e.g. poly His . An anti NTB A antibody polypeptide also can be linked to the FLAG Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. peptide as described in Hopp et al. 6 1204 1988 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 011 912. The FLAG peptide is highly antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody enabling reversibly rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein. Reagents useful for preparing fusion proteins in which the FLAG peptide is fused to a given polypeptide are commercially available Sigma St. Louis Mo. USA .

Oligomers that contain one or more anti NTB A antibody polypeptides may be employed as NTB A antagonists. Oligomers may be in the form of covalently linked or non covalently linked dimers trimers or higher oligomers. Oligomers comprising two or more anti NTB A antibody polypeptides are contemplated for use with one example being a homodimer. Other oligomers include heterodimers homotrimers heterotrimers homotetramers heterotetramers etc.

One embodiment is directed to oligomers comprising multiple anti NTB A antibody polypeptides joined via covalent or non covalent interactions between peptide moieties fused to the anti NTB A antibody polypeptides. Such peptides may be peptide linkers spacers or peptides that have the property of promoting oligomerization. Leucine zippers and certain polypeptides derived from antibodies are among the peptides that can promote oligomerization of anti NTB A antibody polypeptides attached thereto as described in more detail below.

In particular embodiments the oligomers comprise from two to four anti NTB A polypeptides. The anti NTB A antibody moieties of the oligomer may be in any of the forms described above e.g. variants or fragments. Preferably the oligomers comprise anti NTB A antibody polypeptides that have NTB A binding activity.

In one embodiment an oligomer is prepared using polypeptides derived from immunoglobulins. Preparation of fusion proteins comprising certain heterologous polypeptides fused to various portions of antibody derived polypeptides including the Fc domain has been described e.g. by Ashkenazi et al. 88 10535 1991 Byrn et al. 344 677 1990 and Hollenbaugh et al. 1992 Construction of Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins in Suppl 4 pages 10.19.1 10.19.11.

One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a dimer comprising two fusion proteins created by fusing a NTB A binding fragment of an anti NTB A antibody to the Fc region of an antibody. The dimer can be made by for example inserting a gene fusion encoding the fusion protein into an appropriate expression vector expressing the gene fusion in host cells transformed with the recombinant expression vector and allowing the expressed fusion protein to assemble much like antibody molecules whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fc moieties to yield the dimer.

The term Fc polypeptide as used herein includes native and mutein forms of polypeptides derived from the Fc region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins comprising Fc moieties and oligomers formed therefrom offer the advantage of facile purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns.

One suitable Fc polypeptide described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 93 10151 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 426 048 and 5 262 522 each of which is herein incorporated by reference is a single chain polypeptide extending from the N terminal hinge region to the native C terminus of the Fc region of a human IgGantibody. Another useful Fc polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 457 035 and in Baum et al. 13 3992 4001 1994 . The amino acid sequence of this mutein is identical to that of the native Fc sequence presented in WO 93 10151 except that amino acid 19 has been changed from Leu to Glu and amino acid 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. The mutein exhibits reduced affinity for Fc receptors.

In other embodiments the variable portion of the heavy and or light chains of an anti NTB A antibody such as disclosed herein may be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy and or light chain.

Alternatively the oligomer is a fusion protein comprising multiple anti NTB A antibody polypeptides with or without peptide linkers spacer peptides . Among the suitable peptide linkers are those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 751 180 and 4 935 233.

Another method for preparing oligomeric anti NTB A antibody derivatives involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA binding proteins Landschulz et al. 240 1759 1988 and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble oligomeric proteins are described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 94 10308 and the leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D SPD described in Hoppe et al. 344 191 1994 hereby incorporated by reference. The use of a modified leucine zipper that allows for stable trimerization of a heterologous protein fused thereto is described in Fanslow et al. 6 267 78 1994 . In one approach recombinant fusion proteins comprising an anti NTB A antibody fragment or derivative fused to a leucine zipper peptide are expressed in suitable host cells and the soluble anti NTB A antibody fragments or derivatives that form are recovered from the culture supernatant.

Some antibodies that are provided have a binding affinity k for NTB A of at least 10or 10Msecmeasured for instance as described in the examples below. Other antibodies have a kof at least 10 10 10or 10Msec. Certain antibodies that are provided have a low disassociation rate. Some antibodies for instance have a kof 1 10s 1 10sor lower. In another embodiment the kis the same as an antibody having the following combinations of variable region domains V1V1 V1V2 V2V1 or V2V2.

In another aspect the present invention provides an anti NTB A antibody or antigen binding fragment having a half life of at least one day in vitro or in vivo e.g. when administered to a human subject . In one embodiment the antibody or antigen binding fragment has a half life of at least three days. In another embodiment the antibody or antigen binding fragment has a half life of four days or longer. In another embodiment the antibody or antigen binding fragment has a half life of eight days or longer. In another embodiment the antibody or antigen binding fragment is derivatized or modified such that it has a longer half life as compared to the underivatized or unmodified antibody. In another embodiment the antibody contains point mutations to increase serum half life such as described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 00 09560 which is herein incorporated by reference.

The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates or antibody drug conjugates ADC comprising an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate . In one embodiment of the invention an anti NTB A antibody may be conjugated to various therapeutic substances in order to target the NTB A cell surface antigen. Examples of conjugated agents include but are not limited to metal chelate complexes drugs toxins and other effector molecules such as cytokines lymphokines chemokines immunomodulators radiosensitizers asparaginase carboranes and radioactive halogens. Additionally enzymes useful for activating a prodrug or increasing the target specific toxicity of a drug can be conjugated to the antibodies. Such substances are described in further detail below.

The use of antibody drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer Syrigos and Epenetos 19 605 614 1999 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 26 151 172 1997 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 theoretically allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein where systematic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. 1 603 5 1986 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers of Cytotoxic Agents in Cancer Therapy A Review In 84 A. Pincera et al. eds. pp. 475 506 . Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 21 183 87 1986 . Drugs used in these methods include danuomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. 1986 supra . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldamanycin Mandler et al. 92 1573 1581 2000 Mandler et al. 10 1025 1028 2000 Mandler et al. 13 786 791 2002 maytansinoids European Patent No. EP 1391213 Liu et al. 93 8618 8623 1996 and calicheamicin Lode et al. 58 2928 1998 Rinman et al. 53 3336 3342 1993 . The toxins may effect their cytotoxin and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

The antibodies of the present invention can be used in combination with various chemotherapeutic agents toxins and regimens. The agents and or toxins can either be administered before after or concurrently with the antibodies of the invention. Alternatively if appropriate the agents and toxins can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention to target the agent directly to tumor cells.

A chemotherapeutic agent is a chemical compound or combination of compounds useful in the treatment of cancer. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents such as thiotepa and cyclosphosphamide CYTOXAN Mead Johnson and Co. Evansville Ind. alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan improsulfan and piposulfan aziridines such as benzodopa carboquone meturedopa and uredopa ethylenimines and methylamelamines including altretamine triethylenemelamine trietylenephosphoramide triethylenethiophosphaoramide and trimethylolomelamine nitrogen mustards such as chlorambucil chlomaphazine cholophosphamide estramustine ifosfamide mechlorethamine mechlorethamine oxide hydrochloride melphalan novembiehin phenesterine prednimustine trofosfamide uracil mustard nitrosureas such as carmustine chlorozotocin fotemustine lomustine nimustine ranimustine antibiotics such as aclacinomysins actinomycin authramycin azaserine bleomycins cactinomycin calicheamicin carabicin caminomycin carzinophilin chromoinycins dactinomycin daunorubicin detorubicin 6 diazo 5 oxo L norleucine doxorubicin epirubicin esorubicin idambicin marcellomycin mitomycins mycophenolic acid nogalamycin olivomycins peplomycin potfiromycin puromycin quelamycin rodorubicin streptonigrin streptozocin tubercidin ubenimex zinostatin zorubicin anti metabolites such as methotrexate and 5 fluorouracil 5 FU folic acid analogs such as denopterin pteropterin trimetrexate purine analogs such as fludarabine 6 mercaptopurine thiamiprine thioguanine pyrimidine analogs such as ancitabine azacitidine 6 azauridine carmofur cytarabine dideoxyuridine doxifluridine enocitabine floxuridine 5 FU androgens such as calusterone dromostanolone propionate epitiostanol mepitiostane testolactone anti adrenals such as aminoglutethimide mitotane trilostane folic acid replenisher such as frolinic acid aceglatone aldophosphamide glycoside aminolevulinic acid amsacrine bestrabucil bisantrene edatraxate defofamine demecolcine diaziquone elfomithine elliptinium acetate etoglucid gallium nitrate hydroxyurea lentinan lonidamine mitoguazone mitoxantrone mopidamol nitracrine pentostatin phenamet pirarubicin podophyllinic acid 2 ethylhydrazide procarbazine PSKTM razoxane sizofuran spirogermanium tenuazonic acid triaziquone 2 2 2 trichlorotriethylamine urethan vindesine dacarbazine mannomustine mitobronitol mitolactol pipobroman gacytosine arabinoside Ara C cyclophosphamide thiotepa taxoids e.g. paclitaxel TAXOL Bristol Myers Squibb Oncology Princeton N.J. and doxetaxel TAXOTERE Rh ne Poulenc Rorer Antony France gemcitabine 6 thioguanine mercaptopurine methotrexate platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin vinblastine platinum etoposide VP 16 ifosfamide mitomycin C mitoxantrone vincristine vinorelbine navelbine novantrone teniposide daunomycin aminopterin xeloda ibandronate CPT 11 topoisomerase inhibitor RFS 2000 difluoromethylomithine DMFO retinoic acid esperamicins capecitabine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts acids or derivatives of any of the above.

Other useful chemotherapeutic agents include anti hormonal agents that act to regulate or inhibit hormone action on tumors such as anti estrogens including for example tamoxifen raloxifene aromatase inhibiting 4 5 imidazoles 4 hydroxytamoxifen trioxifene keoxifene LY117018 onapristone and toremifene FARESTON GTx Inc. Memphis Tenn. and anti androgens such as flutamide nilutamide bicalutamide leuprolide and goserelin and pharmaceutically acceptable salts acids or derivatives of any of the above.

Also useful are the chemotherapeutic regimens known as CHOP a combination of cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine and prednisone as well as the use of the constituents of CHOP either alone or in various combinations such as CO CH CP COP CHO CHP HO HP HOP OP etc. CHOP and bleomycin CHOP BLEO cyclophosphamide and fludarabine cyclophosphamide mitoxantrone prednisone and vincristine cyclophosphamide dexamethasone doxorubicin and vincristine CAVD CAV cyclophosphamide doxorubicin and prednisone cyclophosphamide mitoxantrone prednisone and vincristine CNOP cyclophosphamide methotrexate leucovorin and cytarabine COMLA cyclophosphamide dexamethasone doxorubicin and prednisone cylophosphamide prednisone procarbazine and vincristine COPP cylophosphamide prednisone and vincristine COP and CVP 1 cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone etoposide mitoxantrone ifosfamide and etoposide MIV cytarabine methylprednisolone and cisplatin ESHAP methylprednisolone cytarabine and cisplatin ESAP methotrexate leucovorin doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine bleomycin and prednisone MACOP B methotrexate bleomycin doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine and dexamethasone m BACOD prednisone cyclophosphamide etoposide cytarabine bleomycin vincristine methotrexate and leucovorin PROMACE CYTABOM etoposide cyclophosphamide vincristine prednisone and bleomycin VACOP B fludarabine and mitoxantrone cisplatine cytarabine and etoposide desamethasone fludarabine and mitoxantrone chlorambucil and prednisone busulfan and fludarabine ICE DVP ATRA Idarubicin hoelzer chemotherapy regime La La chemotherapy regime ABVD CEOP 2 CdA FLAG and IDA with or without subsequent G CSF treatment VAD M and P C Weekly ABCM MOPP cisplatin cytarabine and dexamethasone DHAP as well as the additional known chemotherapeutic regimens.

See for example International Patent Application Publication No. WO 93 21232.

A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Goodwin and Meares 80 2675 2680 1997 have described the use of yttrium 90 labeled monoclonal antibodies in various strategies to maximize the dose to tumor while limiting normal tissue toxicity. Other known cytotoxic radionuclides include but are not limited to phosphorus 32 copper 67 arsenic 77 rhodium 105 palladium 109 silver 111 tin 121 iodine 125 or 131 holmium 166 lutetium 177 rhenium 186 or 188 iridium 194 gold 199 astatium 211 yttrium 90 samarium 153 or bismuth 212 all of which can be used to label antibodies directed against the NTB A cell surface antigen for the treatment of cancer. When the conjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example technetium 99m or iodine 123 or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging MRI such as iodine 123 iodine 131 iodine 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The anti NTB A antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof can be conjugated to radionuclides using an indirect labeling or indirect labeling approach. By indirect labeling or indirect labeling approach is intended that a chelating agent is covalently attached to an antibody and at least one radionuclide is inserted into the chelating agent. See for example the chelating agents and radionuclides described in Srivastava and Mease 18 589 603 1991 . Alternatively the anti NTB A antibody may be labeled using direct labeling or a direct labeling approach where a label such as a radionuclide is covalently attached directly to an antibody typically via an amino acid residue . For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as technetium 99m iodine 123 rhenium 186 rhenium 188 and indium 111 can be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The iodogen method Franker et al. 80 49 57 1978 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chantal CRC Press 1989 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of an anti NTB A antibody and a cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bos p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . C labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See International Patent Application Publication No. WO 94 11026.

Further the invention provides an embodiment wherein the antibody of the invention is linked to an enzyme that converts a prodrug into a cytotoxic drug. The enzymes cleave the non toxic prodrug into the toxic drug which leads to tumor cell death. Suitable prodrug enzymes include thymidine kinase TK xanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase GPT gene from or cytosine deaminase CD or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase HPRT . Additional representative examples of enzymes and associated prodrug molecules include alkaline phosphatase and various toxic phosphorylated compounds such as phenolmustard phosphate doxorubicin phosphate mitomycin phosphate and etoposide phosphate galactosidase and N 4 D galactopyranosyl benzyloxycarbonyl daunorubicin azoreductase and azobenzene mustards glucosidase and amygdalin glucuronidase and phenolmustard glucuronide and epirubicin glucuronide carboxypeptidase A and methotrexate alanine cytochrome P450 and cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide DT diaphorase and 5 aziridine 1 yl 2 4 dinitrobenzamide CB1954 Cobb et al. 18 1519 1969 Knox et al. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 12 195 1993 glutamyl transferase and glutamyl p phenylenediamine mustard nitroreductase and CB1954 or derivatives of 4 nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl glucose oxidase and glucose xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine and plasmin and peptidyl p phenylenediamine mustard.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as calcheamicin maytansinoids a trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as deoxyribonuclease DNase .

Additionally the anti NTB A antibodies can be attached to various labels in order to screen biological samples such as blood tissues and or tumors for the presence or absence of the proteins as an indication of cancer as described further below.

In the antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody through a linker L . The ADC of Formula I see below may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Ab L D I 

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiolthreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.

Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium metaperiodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan and Stroh 3 138 146 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such as streptavidin for utilization in tumor or cancer cell pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

DNA encoding antibody polypeptides e.g. heavy or light chain variable domain only or full length may be isolated from B cells of mice that have been immunized with NTB A or an immunogenic fragment thereof. The DNA may be isolated by conventional procedures such as polymerase chain reaction PCR . Phage display is another example of a known technique whereby derivatives of antibodies may be prepared. In one approach polypeptides that are components of an antibody of interest are expressed in any suitable recombinant expression system and the expressed polypeptides are allowed to assemble to form antibody molecules.

Exemplary nucleic acids that encode the light and heavy chains variable regions and CDRs of the antibodies and antigen binding fragments are provided in Tables 1 and 2 above.

In another embodiment the nucleic acid molecule encodes an amino acid sequence of a Vthat is at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 at least 96 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 identical to one of the amino acid sequences encoding a Vas described immediately above particularly to a Vthat comprises an amino acid sequence of one of SEQ ID NO 5 or 9. In another embodiment the nucleic acid molecule encoding a Vis one that hybridizes under stringent conditions to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a Vas described above particularly to a Vthat comprises an amino acid sequence of one of SEQ ID NO 5 or 9. The invention also provides a nucleic acid sequence encoding a Vthat hybridizes under stringent conditions to a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleic acid sequence of one of SEQ ID NO 4 or 8.

The nucleic acid molecule encoding either or both of the entire heavy and light chains of an anti NTB A antibody or the variable regions thereof may be obtained from any source that produces an anti NTB A antibody. Methods of isolating mRNA encoding an antibody are well known in the art. See e.g. Sambrook et al. supra. The mRNA may be used to produce cDNA for use in the polymerase chain reaction PCR or cDNA cloning of antibody genes. In one embodiment of the invention the nucleic acid molecules may be obtained from a hybridoma that expresses an anti NTB A antibody as described above preferably a hybridoma that has as one of its fusion partners a transgenic animal cell that expresses human immunoglobulin genes such as a XENOMOUSE Amgen Fremont Calif. USA non human mouse transgenic animal or a non human non mouse transgenic animal. In another embodiment the hybridoma is derived from a non human non transgenic animal which may be used e.g. for humanized antibodies.

A nucleic acid molecule encoding the entire heavy chain of an anti NTB A antibody may be constructed by fusing a nucleic acid molecule encoding the variable domain of a heavy chain or an antigen binding domain thereof with a constant domain of a heavy chain. Similarly a nucleic acid molecule encoding the light chain of an anti NTB A antibody may be constructed by fusing a nucleic acid molecule encoding the variable domain of a light chain or an antigen binding fragment thereof with a constant domain of a light chain. The nucleic acid molecules encoding the Vand Vchain may be converted to full length antibody genes by inserting them into expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant and light chain constant regions respectively such that the Vsegment is operatively linked to the heavy chain constant region C segment s within the vector and the Vsegment is operatively linked to the light chain constant region C segment within the vector. Alternatively the nucleic acid molecules encoding the Vor Vchains are converted into full length antibody genes by linking e.g. ligating the nucleic acid molecule encoding a Vchain to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a Cchain using standard molecule biological techniques. The same may be achieved using nucleic acid molecules encoding Vand Cchains. The sequences of human heavy and light chain constant region genes are known in the art. See e.g. Kabat et al. 1991 supra. Nucleic acid molecules encoding the full length heavy and or light chains may then be expressed from a cell into which they have been introduced and the anti NTB A antibody isolated.

In another embodiment a nucleic acid molecule encoding either the heavy chain of an anti NTB A antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof or the light chain of an anti NTB A antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof may be isolated from a non human non mouse animal that expresses human immunoglobulin genes and has been immunized with a NTB A antigen. In another embodiment the nucleic acid molecule may be isolated from an anti NTB A antibody producing cell derived from a non transgenic animal or from a human patient who produces anti NTB A antibodies. Methods of isolating mRNA from the anti NTB A antibody producing cells may be isolated by standard techniques cloned and or amplified using PCR and library construction techniques and screened using standard protocols to obtain nucleic acid molecules encoding anti NTB A heavy and light chains.

The nucleic acid molecules may be used to recombinantly express large quantities of anti NTB A antibodies as described below. The nucleic acid molecules may also be used to produce chimeric antibodies single chain antibodies immunoadhesins diabodies mutated antibodies and antibody derivatives. If the nucleic acid molecules are derived from a non human non transgenic animal the nucleic acid molecules may be used for antibody humanization.

The invention further provides nucleic acids that hybridize to other nucleic acids e.g. nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence listed in Tables 1 2 under particular hybridization conditions. Methods for hybridizing nucleic acids are well known in the art. See e.g. John Wiley and Sons N.Y. 1989 6.3.1 6.3.6. As defined herein a moderately stringent hybridization condition uses a prewashing solution containing 5 sodium chloride sodium citrate SSC 0.5 SDS 1.0 mM EDTA pH 8.0 hybridization buffer of about 50 formamide 6 SSC and a hybridization temperature of 55 C. or other similar hybridization solutions such as one containing about 50 formamide with a hybridization temperature of 42 C. and washing conditions of 60 C. in 0.5 SSC 0.1 SDS. A stringent hybridization condition hybridizes in 6 SSC at 45 C. followed by one or more washes in 0.1 SSC 0.2 SDS at 68 C. Furthermore one of skill in the art can manipulate the hybridization and or washing conditions to increase or decrease the stringency of hybridization such that nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequence that are at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 at least 96 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 identical to each other typically remain hybridized to each other.

The basic parameters affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable conditions are set forth by for example Sambrook Fritsch and Maniatis Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. chapters 9 and 11 1989 Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley and Sons Inc. sections 2.10 and 6.3 6.4 1995 both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes and can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art based on for example the length and or base composition of the DNA.

Changes can be introduced by mutation into a nucleic acid thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide e.g. an antibody or antibody derivative of the invention that it encodes. Mutations can be introduced using any technique known in the art. In one embodiment one or more particular amino acid residues are changed using for example a site directed mutagenesis protocol. In another embodiment one or more randomly selected residues is changed using for example a random mutagenesis protocol. However it is made a mutant polypeptide can be expressed and screened for a desired property.

Mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid without significantly altering the biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example one can make nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at non essential amino acid residues. Alternatively one or more mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid that selectively change the biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example the mutation can quantitatively or qualitatively change the biological activity. Examples of quantitative changes include increasing reducing or eliminating the activity. Examples of qualitative changes include changing the antigen specificity of an antibody.

In another aspect the present invention provides nucleic acid molecules that are suitable for use as primers or hybridization probes for the detection of nucleic acid sequences of the invention. A nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a full length polypeptide of the invention for example a fragment that can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding an active portion e.g. an NTB A binding portion of a polypeptide of the invention.

In another embodiment the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be used as probes or PCR primers for specific antibody sequences. For instance a nucleic acid molecule probe may be used in diagnostic methods or a nucleic acid molecule PCR primer may be used to amplify regions of DNA that could be used inter alia to isolate nucleic acid sequences for use in producing variable domains of anti NTB A antibodies. In a preferred embodiment the nucleic acid molecules are oligonucleotides. In a more preferred embodiment the oligonucleotides are from highly variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the antibody of interest. In an even more preferred embodiment the oligonucleotides encode all or part of one or more of the CDRs.

Probes based on the sequence of a nucleic acid of the invention can be used to detect the nucleic acid or similar nucleic acids for example transcripts encoding a polypeptide of the invention. The probe can comprise a label group e.g. a radioisotope a fluorescent compound an enzyme or an enzyme co factor. Such probes can be used to identify a cell that expresses the polypeptide.

The invention provides vectors comprising the nucleic acid molecules of the invention that encode the heavy chain or the antigen binding portion thereof. The invention also provides vectors comprising the nucleic acid molecules of the invention that encode the light chain or antigen binding portion thereof. The invention also provides vectors comprising nucleic acid molecules encoding fusion proteins modified antibodies antibody fragments and probes thereof.

In another aspect the present invention provides vectors comprising a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention or a portion thereof e.g. a fragment containing one or more CDRs or one or more variable region domains . Examples of vectors include but are not limited to plasmids viral vectors non episomal mammalian vectors and expression vectors for example recombinant expression vectors. The recombinant expression vectors of the invention can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. The recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression which is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Regulatory sequences include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cells e.g. Simian Virus 40 SV40 early gene enhancer Rous sarcoma virus RSV promoter and cytomegalovirus CMV promoter those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells e.g. tissue specific regulatory sequences see Voss et al. 11 287 1986 Maniatis et al. 236 1237 1986 incorporated by reference herein in their entireties and those that direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in response to particular treatment or condition e.g. the metallothionin promoter in mammalian cells and the tet responsive and or streptomycin responsive promoter in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed the level of expression of protein desired etc. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or peptides including fusion protein or peptides encoded by nucleic acids as described herein.

To express the antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof DNAs encoding partial or full length light and heavy chains obtained as described above are inserted into expression vectors such that the genes area operatively linked to transcriptional and translational control sequences. Expression vectors include plasmids retroviruses cosmids YACs EBV derived episomes and the like. The antibody gene is ligated into a vector such that transcriptional and translational control sequences within the vector serve their intended function of regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody gene. The expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to be compatible with the expression host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate vectors. In a preferred embodiment both genes are inserted into the same expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into the expression vector by standard methods e.g. ligation of complementary restriction sites on the antibody gene fragment and vector or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are present .

A convenient vector is one that encodes a functionally complete human Cor Cimmunoglobulin sequence with appropriate restriction sites engineered so that any Vor Vsequence can be easily inserted and expressed as described above. In such vectors splicing usually occurs between the splice donor site in the inserted J region and the splice acceptor site preceding the human C region and also at the splice regions that occur within the human Cexons. Polyadenylation and transcription termination occur at native chromosomal sites downstream of the coding regions. The recombinant expression vector can also encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antibody chain from a host cell. The antibody chain gene may be cloned into the vector such that the signal peptide is linked in frame to the amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal peptide can be an immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterologous signal peptide e.g. a signal peptide from a non immunoglobulin protein .

In addition to the antibody chain genes the recombinant expression vectors of the invention carry regulatory sequences that control the expression of the antibody chain genes in a host cell. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector including the selection of regulatory sequences may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed the level of expression of protein desired etc. Preferred regulatory sequences for mammalian host cell expression include viral elements that direct high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells such as promoters and or enhancers derived from retroviral LTRs CMV such as the CMV promoter enhancer SV40 such as the SV40 promoter enhancer adenovirus e.g. the adenovirus major late promoter AdMLP polyoma and strong mammalian promoters such as native immunoglobulin and actin promoters. For further description of viral regulatory elements and sequences thereof see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 168 062 4 510 245 and 4 968 615.

In addition to the antibody chain genes and regulatory sequences the recombinant expression vectors of the invention may carry additional sequences such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells e.g. origins of replication and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 399 216 4 634 665 and 5 179 017 . For example typically the selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs such as G418 hygromycin or methotrexate on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced. Preferred selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene for use in dhfr host cells with methotrexate selection amplification and the neomycin gene for G418 selection .

In another aspect the present invention provides host cells into which a recombinant expression vector of the invention has been introduced. A host cell can be any prokaryotic cell for example or eukaryotic cell for example yeast for example insect or mammalian cells e.g. CHO cells . Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. For stable transfection of mammalian cells it is known that depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants a gene that encodes a selectable marker e.g. for resistance to antibiotics is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest. Preferred selectable markers include those which confer resistance to drugs such as G418 hygromycin and methotrexate. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection e.g. cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive while the other cells die among other methods.

As explained above the NTB A cell surface antigen is used to produce antibodies for therapeutic diagnostic and purification purposes. These antibodies may be polyclonal or monoclonal antibody preparations monospecific antisera human antibodies or may be hybrid or chimeric antibodies such as humanized antibodies altered antibodies F ab fragments Fab fragments Fv fragments single domain antibodies dimeric or trimeric antibody fragment constructs minibodies or functional fragments thereof which bind to the antigen in question. Antibodies are produced using techniques well known to those of skill in the art and disclosed in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 011 308 4 722 890 4 016 043 3 876 504 3 770 380 and 4 372 745.

For example the NTB A antigens can be used to produce NTB A specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for use in diagnostic and detection assays for purification and for use as therapeutics. NTB A specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies bind with high affinity to NTB A antigens. The non human antibodies that are provided can be for example derived from any antibody producing animal such as mouse rat rabbit goat donkey or non human primate such as monkey e.g. cynomologous or rhesus monkey or ape e.g. chimpanzee . Serum from the immunized animal is collected and the antibodies are purified from the plasma by for example precipitation with ammonium sulfate followed by chromatography preferably affinity chromatography. Techniques for producing and processing polyclonal antisera are known in the art.

Non human antibodies can be used for instance in in vitro cell culture and cell culture based applications or any other application where an immune response to the antibody does not occur or is insignificant can be prevented is not a concern or is desired. In certain embodiments of the invention the antibodies may be produced by immunizing with full length NTB A i.e. SEQ ID NO 2 or with the extracellular domain i.e. SEQ ID NO 3 . Alternatively the certain non human antibodies may be raised by immunizing with amino acids 22 to 184 of SEQ ID NO 2 i.e. SEQ ID NO 12 amino acids 22 to 154 of SEQ ID NO 2 i.e. SEQ ID NO 13 amino acids 11 to 124 of SEQ ID NO 2 i.e. SEQ ID NO 14 or amino acids 95 to 124 of SEQ ID NO 2 i.e. SEQ ID NO 17 which are segments of human NTB A that form part of the epitope to which certain antibodies provided herein bind e.g. 480.12 or 994.1 see . In yet further embodiments anti NTB A antibodies may be raised by immunizing non human animals with amino acids 22 to 94 of SEQ ID NO 2 i.e. SEQ ID NO 15 or amino acids 22 to 64 of SEQ ID NO 2 i.e. SEQ ID NO 16 . The antibodies may be polyclonal monoclonal or may be synthesized in host cells by expressing recombinant DNA.

Fully human antibodies may be prepared as described above by immunizing transgenic animals containing human immunoglobulin loci or by selecting a phage display library that is expressing a repertoire of human antibodies.

Mouse and or rabbit monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes present in the cell surface antigen can also be readily produced. In order to produce such monoclonal antibodies the mammal of interest such as a rabbit or mouse is immunized such as by mixing or emulsifying the antigen in saline preferably in an adjuvant such as Freund s complete adjuvant FCA and injecting the mixture or emulsion parenterally generally subcutaneously or intramuscularly . The animal is generally boosted 2 6 weeks later with one or more injections of the antigen in saline preferably using Freund s incomplete adjuvant FIA .

The monoclonal antibodies mAbs of the invention can be produced by a variety of techniques including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology e.g. the standard somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein 256 495 1975 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Alternatively other techniques for producing monoclonal antibodies can be employed for example the viral or oncogenic transformation of B lymphocytes. One suitable animal system for preparing hybridomas is the murine system which is a very well established procedure. Immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are known in the art. For such procedures B cells from immunized mice are fused with a suitable immortalized fusion partner such as a murine myeloma cell line. If desired rats or other mammals besides can be immunized instead of mice and B cells from such animals can be fused with the murine myeloma cell line to form hybridomas. Alternatively a myeloma cell line from a source other than mouse may be used. Fusion procedures for making hybridomas are also well known.

Antibodies may also be generated by in vitro immunization using methods known in the art. See e.g. James et al. 100 5 40 1987 . Polyclonal antisera are then obtained from the immunized animal. However rather than bleeding the animal to extract serum the spleen and optionally several large lymph nodes is removed and dissociated into single cells. If desired the spleen cells splenocytes may be screened after removal of nonspecifically adherent cells by applying a cell suspension to a plate or well coated with the antigen. B cells expressing membrane bound immunoglobulin specific for the antigen will bind to the plate and are not rinsed away with the rest of the suspension. Resulting B cells or all dissociated splenocytes are then induced to fuse with cells from an immortalized cell line also termed a fusion partner to form hybridomas. Typically the fusion partner includes a property that allows selection of the resulting hybridomas using specific media. For example fusion partners can be hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine HAT sensitive.

If rabbit rabbit hybridomas are desired the immortalized cell line will be from a rabbit. Such rabbit derived fusion partners are known in the art and include for example cells of lymphoid origin such as cells from a rabbit plasmacytoma as described in Spieker Polet et al. 92 9348 9352 1995 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 675 063 or the TP 3 fusion partner described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 859 595 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. If a rabbit mouse hybridoma or a rat mouse or mouse mouse hybridoma or the like is desired the mouse fusion partner will be derived from an immortalized cell line from a mouse such as a cell of lymphoid origin typically from a mouse myeloma cell line. A number of such cell lines are known in the art and are available from ATCC American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. USA .

Fusion is accomplished using techniques well known in the art. Chemicals that promote fusion are commonly referred to as fusogens. These agents are extremely hydrophilic and facilitate membrane contact. One particularly preferred method of cell fusion uses polyethylene glycol PEG . Another method of cell fusion is electrofusion. In this method cells are exposed to a predetermined electrical discharge that alters the cell membrane potential. Additional methods for cell fusion include bridged fusion methods. In this method the antigen is biotinylated and the fusion partner is avidinylated. When the cells are added together an antigen reactive B cell antigen biotin avidin fusion partner bridge is formed. This permits the specific fusion of an antigen reactive cell with an immortalizing cell. The method may additionally employ chemical or electrical means to facilitate cell fusion.

Following fusion the cells are cultured in a selective medium e.g. HAT medium . In order to enhance antibody secretion an agent that has secretory stimulating effects can optionally be used such as IL 6. See e.g. Liguori et al. 20 189 198 2001 . The resulting hybridomas can be plated by limiting dilution and are assayed for the production of antibodies which bind specifically to the immunizing antigen and which do not bind to unrelated antigens . The selected monoclonal antibody secreting hybridomas are then cultured either in vitro e.g. in tissue culture bottles or hollow fiber reactors or in vivo e.g. as ascites in mice . For example hybridomas producing NTB A specific antibodies can be identified using RIA or ELISA and isolated by cloning in semi solid agar or by limiting dilution. Clones producing the desired antibodies can be isolated by another round of screening.

An alternative technique for generating the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention is the selected lymphocyte antibody method SLAM . This method involves identifying a single lymphocyte that is producing an antibody with the desired specificity or function within a large population of lymphoid cells. The genetic information that encodes the specificity of the antibody i.e. the immunoglobulin Vand VDNA is then rescued and cloned. See e.g. Babcook et al. 93 7843 7848 1996 for a description of this method.

For further descriptions of rabbit monoclonal antibodies and methods of making the same from rabbit rabbit and rabbit mouse fusions see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 675 063 rabbit rabbit 4 859 595 rabbit rabbit 5 472 868 rabbit mouse and 4 977 081 rabbit mouse .

The single chain antibodies that are provided may be formed by linking heavy and light chain variable domain Fv region fragments see e.g. Table 1 via an amino acid bridge short peptide linker resulting in a single polypeptide chain. Such single chain Fvs scFvs may be prepared by fusing DNA encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the two variable domain polypeptides Vand V . The resulting polypeptides can fold back on themselves to form antigen binding monomers or they can form multimers e.g. dimers trimers or tetramers depending on the length of a flexible linker between the two variable domains Kortt et al. 10 423 1997 Kort et al. 18 95 108 2001 . By combining different Vand V comprising polypeptides one can form multimeric scFvs that bind to different epitopes Kriangkum et al. 18 31 40 2001 . Techniques developed for the production of single chain antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 Bird 242 423 1988 Huston et al. 85 5879 1988 Ward et al. Nature 334 544 1989 de Graff et al. 178 379 87 2002 . Single chain antibodies derived from antibodies provided herein include but are not limited to scFvs comprising the variable domain combinations V1V1 V1V2 V2V1 or V2V2.

Antibodies provided herein that are of one subclass can be changed to antibodies of a different subclass using subclass switching methods. Thus IgG antibodies may be derived from an IgM antibody for example and vice versa. Such techniques allow the preparation of new antibodies that possess the antigen binding properties of a given antibody the parent antibody but also exhibit biological properties associated with an antibody isotype or subclass different from that of the parent antibody. Recombinant DNA techniques may be employed. Cloned DNA encoding particular antibody polypeptides may be employed in such procedures e.g. DNA encoding the constant domain of an antibody of the desired isotype. See e.g. Lantto et al. 178 303 16 2002 .

Accordingly the antibodies that are provided include those comprising for example the following variable domain combinations V1V1 V1V2 V2V1 V2V2 having a desired isotype for example IgA IgG IgG IgG IgG IgE and IgD as well as Fab or F ab fragments thereof. Moreover if an IgGis desired it may also be desired to introduce a point mutation eg. CPSCP CPPCP in the hinge region as described in Bloom et al. 6 407 1997 incorporated by reference herein to alleviate a tendency to form intra H chain disulfide bonds that can lead to heterogeneity in the IgGantibodies.

Moreover techniques for deriving antibodies having different properties i.e. varying affinities for the antigen to which they bind are also known. One such technique referred to as chain shuffling involves displaying immunoglobulin variable domain gene repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage often referred to as phage display. Chain shuffling has been used to prepare high affinity antibodies to the hapten 2 phenyloxazol 5 one as described by Marks et al. 10 770 1992 .

Conservative modifications may be made to the heavy and light chains and corresponding modifications to the encoding nucleic acids to produce an anti NTB A antibody having functional and biochemical characteristics. Methods for achieving such modifications are described above.

Antibodies and functional fragments thereof according to the invention may be further modified in various ways. For example if they are to be used for therapeutic purposes they may be conjugated with polyethylene glycol PEGylated to prolong the serum half life or to enhance protein delivery. Alternatively the V region of the subject antibodies or fragments thereof may be fused with the Fc region of a different antibody molecule. The Fc region used for this purpose may be modified so that it does not bind complement thus reducing the likelihood of inducing cell lysis in the patient when the fusion protein is used as a therapeutic agent. In addition the subject antibodies or functional fragments thereof may be conjugated with human serum albumin to enhance the serum half life of the antibody of fragment thereof. Another useful fusion is transthyretin TTR . TTR has the capacity to form a tetramer thus an antibody TTR fusion protein can form a multivalent antibody which may increase its binding avidity.

Alternatively substantial modifications in the functional and or biochemical characteristics of the antibodies and fragments described herein may be achieved by creating substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the heavy and light chains that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the molecular backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulkiness of the side chain. A conservative amino acid substitution may involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a normative residue that has little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position. Furthermore any native residue in the polypeptide may also be substituted with alanine as has been previously described for alanine scanning mutagenesis.

Amino acid substitutions whether conservative or non conservative of the subject antibodies can be implemented by those skilled in the art by applying routine techniques. Amino acid substitutions can be used to identify important residues of the antibodies provided herein or to increase or decrease the affinity of these antibodies for human NTB A or for modifying the binding affinity of other anti NTB A antibodies described herein.

The anti NTB A antibodies and antigen binding fragments can be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. For example anti NTB A antibodies may be produced by recombinant expression systems using any technique known in the art. See for example Kennet et al. eds. Plenum Press N.Y. 1980 Harlow and Lane eds. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1988 .

Antibodies of the present invention can be expressed in hybridoma cell lines or in cell lines other than hybridomas. Expression constructs encoding the antibodies can be used to transform a mammalian insect or microbial host cell. Transformation can be performed using any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell including for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus or bacteriophage and transducing a host cell with the construct by transfection procedures known in the art as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 399 216 4 912 040 4 740 461 and 4 959 455 which patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference for any purpose . The optimal transformation procedure used will depend upon which type of host cell is being transformed. Methods for introduction of heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include but are not limited to dextran mediated transfection calcium phosphate precipitation polybrene mediated transfection protoplast fusion electroporation encapsulation of the polynucleotide s in liposomes mixing nucleic acid with positively charged lipids and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.

Recombinant expression constructs of the invention typically comprise a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide comprising one or more of the following a heavy chain constant region e.g. C1 C2 and or C3 a heavy chain variable region a light chain constant region a light chain variable region one or more CDRs of the light or heavy chain of the anti NTB A antibody. These nucleic acid sequences are inserted into an appropriate expression vector using standard ligation techniques. In one embodiment the 480.12 or 994.1 heavy or light chain constant region is appended to the C terminus of the NTB A specific heavy or light chain variable region and is ligated into an expression vector. The vector is typically selected to be functional in the particular host cell employed i.e. the vector is compatible with the host cell machinery permitting amplification and or expression of the gene can occur . In some embodiments vectors are used that employ protein fragment complementation assays using protein reporters such as dihydrofolate reductase see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 270 964 which is hereby incorporated by reference . Suitable expression vectors can be purchased for example from Invitrogen Life Technologies or BD Biosciences. Other useful vectors for cloning and expressing the antibodies and fragments of the invention include those described in Bianchi and McGrew 84 439 44 2003 herein incorporated by reference. Additional suitable expression vectors are discussed for example in vol. 185 D. V. Goeddel ed. 1990 New York Academic Press herein incorporated by reference.

Typically expression vectors used in any of the host cells contain sequences for plasmid or virus maintenance and for cloning and expression of exogenous nucleotide sequences. Such sequences collectively referred to as flanking sequences typically include one or more of the following operatively linked nucleotide sequences a promoter one or more enhancer sequences an origin of replication a transcriptional termination sequence a complete intron sequence containing a donor and acceptor splice site a sequence encoding a leader sequence for polypeptide secretion a ribosome binding site a polyadenylation sequence a polylinker region for inserting the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide to be expressed and a selectable marker element.

Optionally the vector may contain a tag encoding sequence that is an oligonucleotide molecule located at the 5 or 3 end of the coding sequence the oligonucleotide sequence encoding polyHis such as hexaHis or another tag for which commercially available antibodies exist such as V5 His FLAG HA hemaglutinin from influenza virus or myc. The tag is typically fused to the antibody protein upon expression and can serve as a means for affinity purification of the antibody from the host cell. Affinity purification can be accomplished for example by column chromatography using antibodies against the tag as an affinity matrix. Optionally the tag can subsequently be removed from the purified antibody polypeptide by various means such as using certain peptidases for cleavage.

Flanking sequences in the expression vector may be homologous i.e. from the same species and or strain as the host cell heterologous i.e. from a species other than the host cell species or strain hybrid i.e. a combination of flanking sequences from more than one source synthetic or native. As such the source of a flanking sequence may be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism any vertebrate or invertebrate organism or any plant provided that the flanking sequence is functional in and can be activated by the host cell machinery.

Flanking sequences useful in the vectors of this invention may be obtained by any of several methods well known in the art. Typically flanking sequences useful herein will have been previously identified by mapping and or by restriction endonuclease digestion and can thus be isolated from the proper tissue source using the appropriate restriction endonucleases. In some cases the full nucleotide sequence of a flanking sequence may be known. Here the flanking sequence may be synthesized using the methods described herein for nucleic acid synthesis or cloning.

Where all or only a portion of the flanking sequence is known it may be obtained using PCR and or by screening a genomic library with a suitable oligonucleotide and or flanking sequence fragment from the same or another species. Where the flanking sequence is not known a fragment of DNA containing a flanking sequence may be isolated from a larger piece of DNA that may contain for example a coding sequence or even another gene or genes. Isolation may be accomplished by restriction endonuclease digestion to produce the proper DNA fragment followed by isolation using agarose gel purification QIAGEN column chromatography Qiagen Chatsworth Calif. USA or other methods known to the skilled artisan. The selection of suitable enzymes to accomplish this purpose will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.

An origin of replication is typically a part of prokaryotic expression vectors particularly those purchased commercially and the origin aids in the amplification of the vector in a host cell. If the vector of choice does not contain an origin of replication site one may be chemically synthesized based on a known sequence and ligated into the vector. For example the origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 New England Biolabs Beverly Mass. USA. is suitable for most gram negative bacteria and various origins of replication e.g. SV40 polyoma adenovirus vesicular stomatitis virus VSV or papilloma viruses such as HPV or BPV are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally a mammalian origin of replication is not needed for mammalian expression vectors for example the SV40 origin is often used only because it contains the early promoter .

The expression and cloning vectors of the present invention will typically contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and operably linked to nucleic acid encoding an anti NTB A antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. Promoters are untranscribed sequences located upstream i.e. 5 to the start codon of a structural gene generally within about 100 to 1000 bp that control transcription of the structural gene. Promoters are conventionally grouped into one of two classes inducible promoters and constitutive promoters. Inducible promoters initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions such as the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. Constitutive promoters on the other hand initiate continuous gene product production that is there is little or no experimental control over gene expression. A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. A suitable promoter is operably linked to the DNA encoding an anti NTB A antibody by removing the promoter from the source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion or amplifying the promoter by polymerase chain reaction and inserting the desired promoter sequence into the vector.

Suitable promoters for use with yeast hosts are also well known in the art. Yeast enhancers are advantageously used with yeast promoters. Suitable promoters for use with mammalian host cells are well known and include but are not limited to those obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus retroviruses hepatitis B virus and most preferably SV40. Other suitable mammalian promoters include heterologous mammalian promoters for example heat shock promoters and the actin promoter.

Particular promoters useful in the practice of the recombinant expression vectors of the invention include but are not limited to the SV40 early promoter region Bemoist and Chambon 290 304 10 1981 the CMV promoter the promoter contained in the 3 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus Yamamoto et al. 22 787 97 1980 the herpes thymidine kinase promoter Wagner et al. 78 1444 45 1981 the regulatory sequences of the metallothionine gene Brinster et al. 296 39 42 1982 prokaryotic expression vectors such as the beta lactamase promoter Villa Kamaroff et al. 75 3727 31 1978 or the tac promoter DeBoer et al. 80 21 25 1983 . Also available for use are the following animal transcriptional control regions which exhibit tissue specificity and have been utilized in transgenic animals the elastase I gene control region that is active in pancreatic acinar cells Swift et al. 38 63946 1984 Ornitz et al. 50 399409 1986 MacDonald 7 425 515 1987 the insulin gene control region that is active in pancreatic beta cells Hanahan 315 115 22 1985 the mouse mammary tumor virus control region that is active in testicular breast lymphoid and mast cells Leder et al. 45 485 95 1986 the albumin gene control region that is active in liver Pinkert et al. 1 268 76 1987 the alpha feto protein gene control region that is active in liver Krumlauf et al. 5 1639 48 1985 Hammer et al. 235 53 58 1987 the alpha 1 antitrypsin gene control region that is active in the liver Kelsey et al. 1 161 71 1987 the beta globin gene control region that is active in myeloid cells Mogram et al. 315 338 40 1985 Kollias et al. 46 89 94 1986 the myelin basic protein gene control region that is active in oligodendrocyte cells in the brain Readhead et al. 48 703 12 1987 the myosin light chain 2 gene control region that is active in skeletal muscle Sani 314 283 86 1985 the gonadotropic releasing hormone gene control region that is active in the hypothalamus Mason et al. 234 1372 78 1986 and most particularly the immunoglobulin gene control region that is active in lymphoid cells Grosschedl et al. 38 647 58 1984 Adames et al. 318 533 38 1985 Alexander et al. 7 1436 44 1987 .

An enhancer sequence may be inserted into the vector to increase the transcription in higher eukaryotes of a nucleic acid encoding an anti NTB A antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof of the present invention. Enhancers are cis acting elements of DNA usually about 10 300 bp in length that act on promoters to increase transcription. Enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent. They have been found 5 and 3 to the transcription unit. Several enhancer sequences available from mammalian genes are known e.g. globin elastase albumin alpha feto protein and insulin . An enhancer sequence from a virus also can be used. The SV40 enhancer the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer and adenovirus enhancers are exemplary enhancing elements for the activation of eukaryotic promoters. While an enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to a nucleic acid molecule it is typically placed at a site 5 to the promoter.

In expression vectors a transcription termination sequence is typically located 3 of the end of a polypeptide coding region and serves to terminate transcription. A transcription termination sequence used for expression in prokaryotic cells typically is a G C rich fragment followed by a poly T sequence. While the sequence is easily cloned from a library or even purchased commercially as part of a vector it can also be readily synthesized using methods for nucleic acid synthesis such as those described herein.

A selectable marker gene element encodes a protein necessary for the survival and growth of a host cell grown in a selective culture medium. Typical selection marker genes used in expression vectors encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin tetracycline or kanamycin for prokaryotic host cells b complement auxotrophic deficiencies of the cell or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media. Examples of selectable markers include the kanamycin resistance gene the ampicillin resistance gene and the tetracycline resistance gene. A bacterial neomycin resistance gene can also be used for selection in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells.

Other selection genes can be used to amplify the gene that will be expressed. Amplification is a process whereby genes that cannot in single copy be expressed at high enough levels to permit survival and growth of cells under certain selection conditions are reiterated in tandem within the chromosomes of successive generations of recombinant cells. Examples of suitable amplifiable selectable markers for mammalian cells include dihydrofolate reductase DHFR and promoterless thymidine kinase. In the use of these markers mammalian cell transformants are placed under selection pressure wherein only the transformants are uniquely adapted to survive by virtue of the selection gene present in the vector. Selection pressure is imposed by culturing the transformed cells under conditions in which the concentration of selection agent in the medium is successively increased thereby permitting survival of only those cells in which the selection gene has been amplified. Under these circumstances DNA adjacent to the selection gene such as DNA encoding an antibody of the invention is co amplified with the selection gene. As a result increased quantities of anti NTB A antibody polypeptides are synthesized from the amplified DNA.

A ribosome binding site is usually necessary for translation initiation of mRNA and is characterized by a Shine Dalgarno sequence prokaryotes or a Kozak sequence eukaryotes . The element is typically located 3 to the promoter and 5 to the coding sequence of the polypeptide to be expressed.

In some cases for example where glycosylation is desired in a eukaryotic host cell expression system various presequences can be manipulated to improve glycosylation or yield. For example the peptidase cleavage site of a particular signal peptide can be altered or pro sequences added which also may affect glycosylation. The final protein product may have in the 1 position relative to the first amino acid of the mature protein one or more additional amino acids incident to expression which may not have been totally removed. For example the final protein product may have one or two amino acid residues found in the peptidase cleavage site attached to the amino terminus. Alternatively use of some enzyme cleavage sites may result in a slightly truncated yet active form of the desired polypeptide if the enzyme cuts at such area within the mature polypeptide.

Where a commercially available expression vector lacks some of the desired flanking sequences as described above the vector can be modified by individually ligating these sequences into the vector. After the vector has been chosen and modified as desired a nucleic acid molecule encoding an anti NTB A antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof is inserted into the proper site of the vector.

The completed vector containing sequences encoding the inventive antibody or antigen binding region thereof is inserted into a suitable host cell for amplification and or polypeptide expression. The transformation of an expression vector for an anti NTB A antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof into a selected host cell may be accomplished by well known methods including methods such as transfection infection calcium chloride electroporation microinjection lipofection DEAE dextran method or other known techniques. The method selected will in part be a function of the type of host cell to be used. These methods and other suitable methods are well known to the skilled artisan.

The transformed host cell when cultured under appropriate conditions synthesizes an anti NTB A antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that can subsequently be collected from the culture medium if the host cell secretes it into the medium or directly from the host cell producing it if it is not secreted . The selection of an appropriate host cell will depend upon various factors such as desired expression levels polypeptide modifications that are desirable or necessary for activity such as glycosylation or phosphorylation and ease of folding into a biologically active molecule.

Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include but are not limited to many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC such as Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells human embryonic kidney HEK cells HEK293 cells HeLa cells baby hamster kidney BHK cells monkey kidney cells COS human hepatocellular carcinoma cells e.g. Hep G2 and a number of other cell lines. In certain embodiments the best cell line for expressing a particular DNA construct may be selected by testing various cell lines to determine which ones have the highest levels of expression levels and produce antibodies with constitutive NTB A binding properties.

In certain embodiments the invention also provides compositions comprising the subject anti NTB A antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof together with one or more of the following a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent a carrier a solubilizer and emulsifier a preservative and or an adjuvant. Such compositions may contain an effective amount of the anti NTB A antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that are provided herein in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition of medicament is also included. Such compositions can be used in the treatment of a variety of diseases such as listed below.

The antibodies of the invention can be formulated into therapeutic compositions in a variety of dosage forms such as but not limited to liquid solutions or suspensions tablets pills powders suppositories polymeric microcapsules or microvesicles liposomes and injectable or infusible solutions. The preferred form depends upon the mode of administration and the particular disease or disorder targeted. The compositions also preferably include pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles carriers or adjuvants well known in the art.

A pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle carrier or adjuvant is a non toxic agent that can be tolerated by a recipient patient. Representative non limiting examples of such agents include human serum albumin ion exchangers alumina lecithin buffer substances such as phosphates glycine sorbic acid potassium sorbate and salts or electrolytes such as protamine sulfate. Suitable vehicles are for example water saline phosphate buffered saline dextrose glycerol ethanol or the like and combinations thereof. Other suitable agents are well known to those in the art. See for example Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 19th edition 1995. Actual methods of preparing such compositions are also known or will be apparent to those skilled in the art. See e.g. 1995 supra.

Acceptable formulation components for pharmaceutical preparations are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. In addition to the antibodies and antigen binding regions that are provided compositions according to the invention may contain components for modifying maintaining or preserving for example the pH osmolarity viscosity clarity color isotonicity odor sterility stability rate of dissolution or release adsorption or penetration of the composition. Suitable materials for formulating pharmaceutical compositions include but are not limited to amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine arginine or lysine antimicrobials antioxidants such as ascorbic acid sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen sulfite buffers such as acetate borate bicarbonate Tris HCl citrates phosphates or other organic acids bulking agents such as mannitol or glycine chelating agents such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid EDTA complexing agents such as caffeine polyvinylpyrrolidone beta cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin fillers monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates such as glucose mannose or dextrins proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins coloring flavoring and diluting agents emulsifying agents hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone low molecular weight polypeptides salt forming counterions such as sodium preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride benzoic acid salicylic acid thimerosal phenethyl alcohol methylparaben propylparaben chlorhexidine sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide solvents such as glycerin propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol suspending agents surfactants or wetting agents such as pluronics PEG sorbitan esters polysorbates such as polysorbate 20 polysorbate 80 triton tromethamine lecithin cholesterol tyloxapal stability enhancing agents such as sucrose or sorbitol tonicity enhancing agents such as alkali metal halides preferably sodium or potassium chloride mannitol sorbitol delivery vehicles diluents excipients and or pharmaceutical adjuvants. see 1995 supra hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition may be either aqueous or non aqueous in nature. Suitable vehicles or carriers for such compositions include water for injection physiological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. Compositions comprising anti NTB A antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further the anti NTB A antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.

Formulation components are present in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. Buffers are advantageously used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH typically within a pH range of from about 4.0 to about 8.5 or alternatively between about 5.0 to 8.0. Pharmaceutical compositions can comprise TRIS buffer of about pH 6.5 8.5 or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0 5.5 which may further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute therefore.

The pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration typically is sterile. Sterilization may be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. If the composition is lyophilized sterilization may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The composition for parenteral administration may be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. In certain embodiments parenteral compositions are placed into a container having a sterile access port for example an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle or a sterile pre filled syringe ready to use for injection.

Additional pharmaceutical methods may be employed to control the duration of action of an antibody in a therapeutic application. Control release preparations can be prepared through the use of polymers to complex or adsorb the antibody. For example biocompatible polymers include matrices of poly ethylene co vinyl acetate and matrices of a polyanhydride copolymer of a stearic acid dimer and sebacic acid. Sherwood et al. 10 1446 1992 . The rate of release of an antibody from such a matrix depends upon the molecular weight of the protein the amount of antibody within the matrix and the size of dispersed particles. Saltzman et al. 55 163 1989 Sherwood et al. supra. Other solid dosage forms are described in 1995 supra.

The above compositions can be administered using conventional modes of delivery including but not limited to intravenous intraperitoneal oral intralymphatic subcutaneous administration intraarterial intramuscular intrapleural intrathecal and by perfusion through a regional catheter. Local administration to a tumor in question will also find use with the present invention. Eye drops can be used for intraocular administration. When administering the compositions by injection the administration may be by continuous infusion or by single or multiple boluses. Intravenous injection provides a useful mode of administration due to the thoroughness of the circulation in rapidly distributing antibodies. For parenteral administration the antibodies may be administered in a pyrogen free parenterally acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired anti NTB A antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which the anti NTB A antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof are formulated as a sterile isotonic solution properly preserved.

Once the pharmaceutical composition of the invention has been formulated it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution suspension gel emulsion solid or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready to use form or in a form e.g. lyophilized that is reconstituted prior to administration.

The components used to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions are preferably of high purity and are substantially free of potentially harmful contaminants e.g. at least National Food NF grade generally at least analytical grade and more typically at least pharmaceutical grade . Moreover compositions intended for in vivo use are usually sterile. To the extent that a given compound must be synthesized prior to use the resulting product is typically substantially free of any potentially toxic agents particularly any endotoxins which may be present during the synthesis or purification process. Compositions for parental administration are also sterile substantially isotonic and made under GMP conditions.

The present invention provides kits for producing multi dose or single dose administration units. For example kits according to the invention may each contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous diluent including for example single and multi chambered pre filled syringes e.g. liquid syringes lyosyringes or needle free syringes .

The subject compositions comprising anti NTB A antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof also may be used ex vivo. In such instances cells tissues or organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to or cultured with the anti NTB A antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. The cultured cells may then be implanted back into the patient or a different patient or used for other purposes.

In certain embodiments anti NTB A antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered using methods such as those described herein to express and secrete the polypeptide. Such cells may be animal or human cells and may be autologous heterologous or xenogenic or may be immortalized. In order to decrease the chance of an immunological response the cells may be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. Encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible semi permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product s but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient s immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.

For purposes of therapy antibodies are administered to a patient in a therapeutically effective amount. A therapeutically effective amount is one that is physiologically significant. An agent is physiologically significant if its presence results in a detectable change in the physiology or disease or disorder state of a recipient. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount that is effective to prevent hinder or retard the onset of a disease state or symptom.

Therapeutically effective doses will be easily determined by one of skill in the art and will depend on the severity and course of the disease the patient s health and response to treatment the patient s age weight height sex previous medical history and the judgment of the treating physician. Typically it is desirable to provide the recipient with a dosage of antibody component or immunoconjugate which is in the range of from about 1 pg kg to 10 mg kg amount of agent body weight of patient although a lower or higher dosage also may be administered as circumstances dictate. In preferred embodiments anti NTB A antibodies are administered at low protein doses such as 20 mg to 2 g protein per dose given once or repeatedly parenterally. Alternatively antibodies are administered in doses of 20 to 1000 mg protein per dose or 20 to 500 mg protein per dose or 20 to 100 mg protein per dose.

Antibodies of the present invention can be used in vivo i.e. injected into subjects for diagnostic or therapeutic uses. The use of antibodies for in vivo diagnosis is well known in the art. Sumerdon et al. 17 247 254 1990 have described an optimized antibody chelator for the radioimmunoscintographic imaging of carcinoembryonic antigen CEA expressing tumors using Indium 111 as the label. Griffin et al. 9 631 640 1991 have described the use of this agent in detecting tumors in patients suspected of having recurrent colorectal cancer. The use of similar agents with paramagnetic ions as labels for magnetic resonance imaging is known in the art R. B. Lauffer 22 339 342 1991 . Thus antibodies directed against the NTB A antigen can be injected into subjects suspected of having a disease or disorder in which NTB A is implicated for the purpose of diagnosing or staging the disease status of the patient. The label used will depend on the imaging modality chosen. Radioactive labels such as Indium 111 Technetium 99m or Iodine 131 can be used for planar scans or single photon emission computed tomography SPECT . Positron emitting labels such as Fluorine 19 can also be used for positron emission tomography PET . For MRI paramagnetic ions such as Gadolinium III or Manganese II can be used. Localization of the label within the patient allows determination of the presence and or spread of the disease.

The antibodies generated against the NTB A cell surface antigen can also be used in standard in vitro immunoassays to screen biological samples such as blood tissues and or tumors for the presence or absence of the NTB A cell surface antigen. Thus the anti NTB A antibodies produced as described above can be used in diagnostic assays. The anti NTB A antibodies can be used as either the capture component and or the detection component in the assays as described further below. Thus the presence of NTB A antigen can be determined by the presence of NTB A antigens and or anti NTB A antibodies.

For example the presence of NTB A cell surface antigens can be detected using standard electrophoretic and immunodiagnostic techniques including immunoassays such as competition direct reaction or sandwich type assays. Such assays include but are not limited to Western blots agglutination tests enzyme labeled and mediated immunoassays such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISAs biotin avidin type assays radioimmunoassays immunoelectrophoresis immunoprecipitation etc. The reactions generally include revealing labels such as fluorescent chemiluminescent radioactive or enzymatic labels or dye molecules or other methods for detecting the formation of a complex between the antigens and the antibodies described above.

Assays can also be conducted in solution such that the antigens and antibodies thereto form complexes under precipitating conditions. The precipitated complexes can then be separated from the test sample for example by centrifugation. The reaction mixture can be analyzed to determine the presence or absence of antibody antigen complexes using any of a number of standard methods such as those immunodiagnostic methods described above.

The antigens and antibodies can be provided in kits with suitable instructions and other necessary reagents in order to conduct immunoassays as described above. The kit can also contain depending on the particular immunoassay used suitable labels and other packaged reagents and materials i.e. wash buffers and the like . Standard immunoassays such as those described above can be conducted using these kits.

The present invention provides antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof that bind to NTB A epitopes that are useful for the treatment of human diseases and pathological conditions. Agents that modulate NTB A activity or other cellular activity may be used in combination with other therapeutic agents to enhance their therapeutic effects or decrease potential side effects.

Supplemental active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. In certain embodiments an anti NTB A antibody of antigen binding fragment can be co formulated with one or more additional therapeutic agents such as a chemotherapeutic agent an antineoplastic agent or an anti tumor agent. These agents include without limitation antibodies that bind other targets e.g. antibodies that bind one or more growth factors cytokines or cell surface receptors NTB A binding proteins antineoplastic agents chemotherapeutic agents anti tumor agents antisense oligonucleotides against NTB A NTB A peptide analogs and or one or more chemical agents that inhibit NTB A production or activity which are known in the art.

In another aspect the anti NTB A antibody may be co administered with other therapeutic agents such as antineoplastic drugs or molecules to a patient who has a hyperproliferative disorder such as cancer or a tumor. In one aspect the invention relates to a method for the treatment of the hyperproliferative disorder in a mammal comprising administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention in combination with an anti tumor agent selected from the group consisting of but not limited to mitotic inhibitors alkylating agents anti metabolites intercalating agents growth factor inhibitors cell cycle inhibitors enzymes topoisomerase inhibitors biological response modifiers anti hormones kinase inhibitors matrix metalloprotease inhibitors genetic therapeutics and anti androgens. In a more preferred embodiment the antibody may be administered with an antineoplastic agent such as adriamycin or taxol. In another preferred embodiment the antibody or combination therapy is administered along with radiotherapy chemotherapy photodynamic therapy surgery or other immunotherapy. In yet another preferred embodiment the antibody will be administered with another antibody. For example an anti NTB A antibody may be administered with an antibody or other agent that is known to inhibit tumor or cancer cell proliferation e.g. an antibody or agent that inhibits erbB2 receptor EGF R CD20 or VEGF.

Co administration of the antibody of the invention with an additional therapeutic agent combination therapy encompasses administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti NTB A antibody and the additional therapeutic agent and administering two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions one comprising an anti NTB A antibody and the other s comprising the additional therapeutic agent s . Further although co administration or combination therapy generally means that the antibody and additional therapeutic agents are administered at the same time as one another it also encompasses instances in which the antibody and additional therapeutic agents are administered at different times. For instance the antibody may be administered once every three days while the additional therapeutic agent is administered once daily. Alternatively the antibody may be administered prior to or subsequent to treatment of the disorder with the additional therapeutic agent. Similarly administration of the anti NTB A antibody may be administered prior to or subsequent to other therapy such as radiotherapy chemotherapy photodynamic therapy surgery or other immunotherapy

The antibody and one or more additional therapeutic agents the combination therapy may be administered once twice or at least the period of time until the condition is treated palliated or cured. Preferably the combination therapy is administered multiple times. The combination therapy may be administered from three times daily to once every six months. The administering may be on a schedule such as three times daily twice daily once daily once every two days once every three days once weekly once every two weeks once every month once every two months once every three months once every six months or may be administered continuously via a minipump. The combination therapy may be administered via an oral mucosal buccal intranasal inhalable intravenous subcutaneous intramuscular parenteral intratumor or topical route. The combination therapy may be administered at a site distant from the site of the tumor or at a site proximal to the tumor. The combination therapy generally will be administered for as long as the tumor is present provided that the antibody causes the tumor or cancer to stop growing or to decrease in weight or volume.

In a still further embodiment the anti NTB A antibody can be labeled with a radiolabel an immunotoxin or a toxin or is a fusion protein comprising a toxic peptide. The anti NTB A antibody or anti NTB A antibody fusion protein directs the radiolabel immunotoxin toxin or toxic peptide to the NTB A expressing cell. In a preferred embodiment the radiolabel immunotoxin toxin or toxic peptide is internalized after the anti NTB A antibody binds to the NTB A on the surface of the cell.

In one aspect the present invention provides reagents and methods useful for treating diseases and conditions characterized by undesirable or aberrant levels of NTB A in a cell. In a particular embodiment the antibodies and derivatives thereof are used in vivo to treat prevent or diagnose a variety of NTB A related neoplastic diseases. These diseases include hematologic malignancies including but not limited to myeloproliferative diseases including acute myelogenous leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia chronic neutrophilic leukemia chronic eosinophilic leukemia hypereosinophilic syndrome chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis polycythemia vera essential or primary thrombocythemia unclassifiable myeloproliferative disease myelodysplastic myeloproliferative diseases including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia myelodysplastic syndromes including chronic anemia nonprogressive anemia refractory anemia refractory cytopenia 5q 5q deletion syndrome unclassifiable myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemias acute myelomonocytic leukemia acute monocytic leukemia acute erythoid leukemia acute megakaryocytic leukemia acute basophilic leukemia acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis acute biphenotypic leukemias precursor B cell neoplasms including precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia mature peripheral B cell neoplasms including B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma B cell prolymphocytic leukemia lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma splenic marginal zone B cell lymphoma hairy cell leukemia plasma cell myeloma plasmacytoma extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma mediastinal large B cell lymphoma primary effusion lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma Burkitt cell leukemia precursor T cell neoplasms including precursor T lymphoblastic lymphoma leukemia precursor T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia mature peripheral T cell neoplasms including T cell prolymphocytic leukemia T cell granular lymphocytic leukemia aggressive NK cell leukemia adult T cell lymphoma leukemia extranodal NK T cell lymphoma enteropathy type T cell lymphoma hepatosplenic gamma delta T cell lymphoma cutaneous T cell lymphoma subcutaneous panniculities like T cell lymphoma mycosis fungiodes Sezary syndrome anaplastic large cell lymphoma peripheral T cell lymphoma angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma anaplastic large cell lymphoma Hodgkin lymphomas mast cell diseases including cutaneous mastocytosis systemic mast cell disease mast cell leukemia sarcoma macrophage histiocytic sarcomas and dendritic cell neoplasms including Langerhans cell histiocytosis Langerhans cell sarcoma follicular dendritic cell sarcoma tumor dendritic cell sarcoma myelomas including multiple myeloma extramedullary plasmacytoma solitary myeloma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia X linked lymphoproliferative disorders and Epstein Barr Virus EBV related conditions such as mononucleosis.

The present invention also provides methods of treating cancer in an animal including humans comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that induces ADCC or CDC of NTB A expressing cells. The invention is further directed to methods of inhibiting cancer cell growth including processes of cellular proliferation invasiveness and metastasis in biological systems. Methods include use of a compound of the invention as an inhibitor of cancer cell growth. Preferably the methods are employed to inhibit or reduce cancer cell growth invasiveness metastasis or tumor incidence in living animals such as mammals. Methods of the invention are also readily adaptable for use in assay systems e.g. assaying cancer cell growth and properties thereof as well as identifying compounds that affect cancer cell growth.

The cancers treatable by methods of the present invention preferably occur in mammals. Mammals include for example humans and other primates as well as pet or companion animals such as dogs and cats laboratory animals such as rats mice and rabbits and farm animals such as horses pigs sheep and cattle.

Tumors or neoplasms include growths of tissue cells in which the multiplication of the cells is uncontrolled and progressive. Some such growths are benign but others are termed malignant and may lead to death of the organism. Malignant neoplasms or cancers are distinguished from benign growths in that in addition to exhibiting aggressive cellular proliferation they may invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. Moreover malignant neoplasms are characterized in that they show a greater loss of differentiation greater dedifferentiation and of their organization relative to one another and their surrounding tissues. This property is also called anaplasia. 

Neoplasms treatable by the present invention also include solid phase tumors malignancies i.e. carcinomas locally advanced tumors and human soft tissue sarcomas. Carcinomas include those malignant neoplasms derived from epithelial cells that infiltrate invade the surrounding tissues and give rise to metastastic cancers including lymphatic metastases. Adenocarcinomas are carcinomas derived from glandular tissue or which form recognizable glandular structures. Another broad category or cancers includes sarcomas which are tumors whose cells are embedded in a fibrillar or homogeneous substance like embryonic connective tissue. The invention also enables treatment of cancers of the myeloid or lymphoid systems including leukemias lymphomas and other cancers that typically do not present as a tumor mass but are distributed in the vascular or lymphoreticular systems.

The type of cancer or tumor cells that may be amenable to treatment according to the invention include for example acute lymphocytic leukemia acute nonlymphocytic leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia chronic myelocytic leukemia cutaneous T cell lymphoma hairy cell leukemia acute myeloid leukemia erythroleukemia chronic myeloid granulocytic leukemia Hodgkin s disease and non Hodgkin s lymphoma gastrointestinal cancers including esophageal cancer stomach cancer colon cancer colorectal cancer polyps associated with colorectal neoplasms pancreatic cancer and gallbladder cancer cancer of the adrenal cortex ACTH producing tumor bladder cancer brain cancer including intrinsic brain tumors neuroblastomas astrocytic brain tumors gliomas and metastatic tumor cell invasion of the central nervous system Ewing s sarcoma head and neck cancer including mouth cancer and larynx cancer kidney cancer including renal cell carcinoma liver cancer lung cancer including small and non small cell lung cancers malignant peritoneal effusion malignant pleural effusion skin cancers including malignant melanoma tumor progression of human skin keratinocytes squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma and hemangiopericytoma mesothelioma Kaposi s sarcoma bone cancer including osteomas and sarcomas such as fibrosarcoma and osteosarcoma cancers of the female reproductive tract including uterine cancer endometrial cancer ovarian cancer ovarian germ cell cancer and solid tumors in the ovarian follicle vaginal cancer cancer of the vulva and cervical cancer breast cancer small cell and ductal penile cancer prostate cancer retinoblastoma testicular cancer thyroid cancer trophoblastic neoplasms and Wilms tumor.

The invention is particularly illustrated herein in reference to treatment of certain types of experimentally defined cancers. In these illustrative treatments standard state of the art in vitro and in vivo models have been used. These methods can be used to identify agents that can be expected to be efficacious in in vivo treatment regimens. However it will be understood that the method of the invention is not limited to the treatment of these tumor types but extends to any cancer derived from any organ system and any disease or disorder in which the NTB A cell surface antigen is implicated. As demonstrated in Example 3 NTB A is highly expressed in primary B cells and B cell related disorders. Leukemias can result from uncontrolled B cell proliferation initially within the bone marrow before disseminating to the peripheral blood spleen lymph nodes and finally to other tissues. Uncontrolled B cell proliferation also may result in the development of lymphomas that arise within the lymph nodes and then spread to the blood and bone marrow. Immunotargeting NTB A may be used in treating B cell malignancies leukemias lymphomas and myelomas including but not limited to multiple myeloma Burkitt s lymphoma cutaneous B cell lymphoma primary follicular cutaneous B cell lymphoma B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL B cell non Hodgkin s lymphoma NHL B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL acute lymphoblastic leukemia hairy cell leukemia HCL acute myelogenous leukemia acute myelomonocytic leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia lymphosarcoma cell leukemia splenic marginal zone lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma B cell large cell lymphoma malignant lymphoma prolymphocytic leukemia PLL lymphoplasma cytoid lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma mucosa associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma primary thyroid lymphoma intravascular malignant lymphomatosis splenic lymphoma Hodgkin s disease and intragraft angiotropic large cell lymphoma. Other diseases that may be treated by the methods of the present invention include multicentric Castleman s disease primary amyloidosis Franklin s disease Seligmann s disease primary effusion lymphoma post transplant lymphoproliferative disease PTLD associated with EBV infection paraneoplastic pemphigus chronic lymphoproliferative disorders X linked lymphoproliferative syndrome XLP acquired angioedema angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia Herman s syndrome post splenectomy syndrome congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III lymphoma associated hemophagocytic syndrome LAHS necrotizing ulcerative stomatitis Kikuchi s disease lymphomatoid granulomatosis Richter s syndrome polycythemic vera PV Gaucher s disease Gougerot Sjogren syndrome Kaposi s sarcoma cerebral lymphoplasmocytic proliferation Bind and Neel syndrome X linked lymphoproliferative disorders pathogen associated disorders such as mononucleosis Epstein Barr Virus lymphoplasma cellular disorders post transplantational plasma cell dyscrasias and Good s syndrome.

The following hybridoma cell lines see Table 4 have been deposited under the conditions of the Budapest Treaty with the American Type Culture Collection 10801 University Boulevard Manassas Va. 20110 2209 ATCC . They will be irrevocably and without restriction or condition released to the public upon issuance of a patent.

Further details of the invention are illustrated by the following non limiting Examples. The disclosures of all citations in the specification are expressly incorporated herein by reference.

A human cDNA library was used as a template to amplify the extracellular domain of NTB A by PCR. The resulting 579 bp fragment with the following sequence was cloned into pIntron.IgKsigP at NheI NotI restriction sites 

3 10HEK 293 cells ATCC were plated in a 100 mm cell culture plate in 10 mL of DMEM 10 FBS Pen Strep L Glutamine. After 24 hours the cells were transfected with 15 g of a plasmid construct containing the sequence of the NTB A extracellular domain fused to a C terminal tag of V5 His NTB A ECD V5His SEQ ID NO 3 using FuGene6 transfection reagent Roche . 48 hours post transfection the medium was changed to 10 mL of DMEM 10 FBS Pen Strep L Glutamine containing 1.0 mg ml G418. The G418 resistant cells were selected for 2 weeks with selection medium changed every 2 3 days. The stable cells were further subjected to clonal selection for 3 4 weeks. Clonal cell lines expressing NTB A ECD V5His recombinant protein were screened with both HisSord based ELISA Qiagen and Western blot analysis detected with anti V5 monoclonal antibody Invitrogen . Stable clones with the highest protein expression levels were selected and expanded. The selected clone s was further subjected to suspension and serum deficient adaptation for 3 4 weeks and the recombinant protein expression was monitored with Western blot analysis. Production of the recombinant protein was performed with 1 L spinners. About 50 L of conditional medium 2 4 mg L were harvested and subjected to protein purification process.

18 L culture supernatants from stably transfected HEK293 cells containing recombinant NTB A ECD V5His was supplemented with 1 mM EDTA and 0.4 mM Pefbloc Roche protease inhibitors and filtered through a 0.22 m filter. The supernatant was 10 fold concentrated and diafiltered with 20 mM sodium phosphate 0.5 M NaCl pH 7 buffer using a Tangential flow filtration TFF system with 10 kDa cut off membrane Pall Filtron . The diafiltered medium was loaded on a 5 mL Ni chelating affinity column GE Healthcare which was then washed with 20 mM imidazole and eluted with a gradient of 20 nM to 220 nM imidazole. Fractions containing NTB A were pooled and buffer exchanged to PBS buffer resulting in a final yield of 10 mg protein with 97 purity.

Recombinant NTB A protein containing the complete extracellular domain was produced as described in Example 1. Using standard protocols see Kohler and Milstein 256 495 497 1975 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety immunizations of Balb c mice with the extracellular domain of NTB A NTB A ECD V5His SEQ ID NO 3 and subsequent fusions with SP20 Ag14 cells ATCC resulted in a total of 296 hybridoma supernatants containing antibodies which bound to NTB A in an ELISA screen 128 of which scored positive by FACS analysis on CA46 Burkitt s lymphoma cells. Briefly CA46 cells ATCC CRL 1648 were resuspended at 5 10cells ml in blocking buffer 10 heat inactivated human serum BioWhittaker 14 402E in PBS and 100 l were added to each well of a round bottom 96 well plates and incubated for 15 minutes on ice. 100 l of hybridoma supernatant was added to each well and plates were incubated for an additional 20 minutes on ice. Cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm supernatant was removed and cells were washed twice in cold FACS buffer 1 BSA in PBS . The pellet was resuspended in 100 l blocking buffer containing 0.25 g of secondary antibody goat anti mouse PE conjugated BD Pharmingen 550589 and incubated for 15 minutes on ice. Cells were analyzed for fluorescence in FL 2 using an Automated Microsampler from Cytek hooked up to a FACScalibur Becton Dickinson .

Based on isotype and relative affinity 20 hits were subcloned re screened selected for scale up and purified using a protein G column. Initial analysis of complement mediated cytotoxicity on B cell lines revealed two lead monoclonal antibodies with potent efficacy in vitro 480.12 and 994.1 ATCC Deposit No. PTA 7832 and PTA 7831 respectively both of which are IgGb murine monoclonal antibodies which were subsequently used in detailed expression analysis and efficacy studies and to generate chimeric monoclonal antibodies discussed below .

Antigen was coated at 1 g ml in Carbonate Bicarbonate buffer Sigma C 3041 on MaxiSorp 96 well plates Nunc and incubated overnight at 4 C. After three washes with 300 g well TBST 0.1 M Tris HCl 0.15 M NaCl 0.05 Tween 20 wells were blocked using 300 g well 2 BSA Sigma A9647 in PBS for one hour at room temperature. Hybridoma supernatants were diluted 1 2 in Iscove s Media Gibco 31980 030 with 10 FBS Gibco 20012 027 and 100 l was added to each well followed by incubation for 2 hours on a plate shaker at room temperature. Three washes with TBST were followed by addition of 100 l of secondary antibody goat anti mouse Ig HRP BioRad 170 6516 diluted 1 10 000 in 0.5 BSA PBS and incubation for one hour on a plate shaker. After five washes with TBST 100 l TMB substrate KPL 50 76 03 were added and color was allowed to develop for 10 minutes. Plates were read at 450 nm on a SpectraMax plate reader Molecular Devices .

Chimeric mAbs against NTB A were generated as follows RNA was isolated from hybridoma fusion cells expressing the anti NTB A mAb of interest. Using standard RACE RT PCR techniques the heavy and light variable regions were cloned into two separate expression vectors in fusion with cDNA encoding for human IgGconstant regions. The resulting plasmids were co transfected into CHO cells and stable cell lines were selected secreting full length chimeric mAbs. Conditioned medium of these cell lines was subjected to protein G purification to yield purified chimeric mAbs. Initial analysis revealed two lead chimeric mAbs 480.12 77 and 994.1 9 both of which are IgGand were subsequently used in detailed expression analysis and efficacy studies discussed below .

Fluorescein FITC labeled mAb 480.12 was used to analyze expression of NTB A in normal and CLL patient primary cells. Normal human peripheral blood cells were assayed for NTB A expression by flow cytometry as described above . Markers for normal B T and NK cells as well as monocytes granulocytes and platelets were used to identify the various cell populations as indicated. The analysis confirmed previously reported expression on T and NK cells Bottino et al. 194 235 246 2001 Valdez et al. 279 18662 18669 2004 and a higher expression on normal B cells. Low levels of NTB A were also found on platelets and monocytes whereas granulocytes did not express NTB A. In addition a total of 12 samples representing circulating B cells from CLL patients were analyzed and found to express relatively high levels of NTB A upper panel . Analysis of cynomolgus peripheral blood cells revealed binding of anti NTB A mAbs as well .

Expression analysis of CD52 and CD20 showed both CD52 and CD20 were downregulated in CLL patient lymphocytes B cells as compared to normal B cells . NTB A expression was maintained in CLL lymphocytes suggesting that antibodies that target NTB A can be useful as therapeutics for CLL.

Monoclonal antibody 994.1 was used to analyze a panel of cell lines by Western blotting . All cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in their recommended medium. Cell lysates were prepared using Cell Lysis Buffer from Cell Signaling Technology 9803 according to the manufacturer s recommendations. Protein concentrations were determined using the RC DC protein assay kit II Bio Rad 500 0122 . 25 g of total cell lysate was loaded on a 4 12 NuPage Bis Tris gel Invitrogen NP0321 and run under non reduced conditions according to the manufacturer s recommendations. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose Invitrogen LC2001 using the XCell SureLock Mini Cell and Blot module Invitrogen EI0002 . Membranes were blocked in 5 non fat milk for 1 hour at room temperature primary antibody was added after 5 washes 5 minutes each in TBST 0.1 M Tris HCl 0.15 M NaCl 0.05 Tween 20 and incubated for 2 hours 1 g ml in 5 milk . Blots were washed five times in TBST and incubated in secondary antibody goat anti mouse Ig HRP BioRad 170 6516 diluted 1 10 000 in 5 milk for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots were washed again five times in TBST developed using Pierce s ECL Western blot substrate 32209 and exposed to Kodak Biomax XAR film Sigma F5763 . Expression levels varied widely in cells from hematopoietic origin in accordance with data obtained by flow cytometry not shown . Expression was highest in B cell lines lower in T and multiple myeloma cells and no signal was detected in lysates from cells originating from the myeloid lineage.

In an immunohistochemistry tissue microarray experiment analysis of normal tissues revealed expression of NTB A in spleen and tonsil all other normal tissues were negative see Table 5 . In lymphomas NTB A expression was observed in diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBL follicular lymphoma small lymphocytic lymphoma SLL mantle cell lymphoma and Burkitt s lymphoma with representative images depicted in . These results demonstrate expression of NTB A on normal and malignant B cells whereas expression on other cells is significantly lower T and NK or absent myeloid .

FACS based competition assays revealed overlapping epitopes of 480.12 and 994.1 data not shown . In order to further investigate this a series of NTB A deletion constructs were made SEQ ID NO 12 16 and expressed in 293 cells. Binding of mAbs 480.12 and 994.1 was determined by flow cytometry. Both antibodies bound NTB A 1 SEQ ID NO 12 NTB A 2 SEQ ID NO 13 and NTB A 3 SEQ ID NO 14 however neither antibody bound NTB A 4 SEQ ID NO 15 or NTB A 5 SEQ ID NO 16 . Therefore the results demonstrate binding of mAbs 480.12 and 994.1 to a region of 30 amino acids at the C terminal end of the first Ig domain of NTB A defined by SEQ ID NO 17 or amino acids 95 to 124 of SEQ ID NO 1 .

An amino acid alignment of the extracellular domains of human and cynomolgus NTB A revealed that the two proteins are 83 identical and 86 similar. The epitope to which NTB A mAbs 480.12 and 994.1 bind is mostly conserved .

To confirm the epitope x ray crystallography analysis was performed by co crystallizing NTB A with an Fab fragment of 480.12 using standard techniques as described in Cao et al. 25 559 570 2006 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Briefly an Fab fragment of mAb 480.12 was generated through papain digestion of the full length mouse mAb. Bacterially expressed NTB A was co crystallized with the Fab fragment and the structure of the co crystal was determined as described in Cao et al 2006 supra. The crystal structure showed that the Fab fragment interacts with the IgV IgC2 interface region of NTB A B .

Kinetic rate constants kand k were determined using surface plasmon resonance and affinities K were then calculated from the rate constants k k . Surface plasmon resonance was carried out on a BIAcore system Biacore International AB Uppsala Sweden . Monoclonal antibodies 480.12 or 994.1 were diluted to 2 g ml and then captured on the biosensor surface using an anti mouse mAb. Antigen was diluted to a starting concentration of 46 nM and tested for binding to the mAb samples using a 3 fold dilution series. Each of 5 concentrations was tested twice except the highest concentration which was tested 5 times in total two times with a short dissociation of 300 seconds followed by three times with a dissociation of 60 minutes. The data sets from the long dissociation experiments were globally fit with the shorter association experiments to determine binding constants for the interactions. The analysis was carried out in HBS pH 7.4 buffer at 25 C. Canziani et al 352 301 307 2004 . The k k and Kvalues for 480.12 and 994.1 are listed in Table 6 below and the binding response rates are shown in .

Complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC assays were performed using mAbs 480.12 and 994.1 on a variety of B and T cell lines as well as myeloid cells as negative controls. Human lymphoma and pro myelogenous leukemia cell lines were obtained from ATCC. CA46 and HL60 were cultured in RPMI 1640 Gibco 61870 20 fetal bovine serum Gibco 26140 079 and 1 Pen Strep Gibco 15070 063 . Raji CA46 Jurkat and Daudi were cultured in RPMI 1640 10 fetal bovine serum and 1 penstrep 37 C. 5 CO .

Using cells at log phase of growth 100 000 cells well were plated in a 96 well plate in 50 l complete media CM RPMI 1640 10 fetal bovine serum and 1 Pen Strep . 50 l of 2 antibody IgGb isotype made up in CM was added to each well and the plates left at room temperature for 20 minutes. 2 10 l of freshly prepared baby rabbit complement Cedarlane labs CL3441 was added to respective wells and plates placed in the incubator for 1 hr. After equilibrating plates to RT viability was measured using CELLTITER GLO Promega G7571 . 100 l of CELLTITER GLO reagent was added to each well and luminescence was measured on a VERITAS microplate luminometer Turner Biosystems Sunnyvale Calif. USA . Data was normalized to complement isotype.

Incubation of CA46 cells with varying concentrations of 994.1 in the presence of complement led to potent cytotoxic activity with an ECof around 10 ng ml . An isotype control antibody displayed no CDC activity. Both 480.12 and 994.1 were effective against a variety of B and T cell lines with ECs ranging from 1 to 27 ng ml C D . The efficacy of the mAbs in CDC assays against the various cell lines mirrored the expression levels of NTB A on these cells as assayed by Western blot and flow cytometry D with ECs for B cells up to 20 fold lower than for T cells.

Anti NTB A mAbs were tested in a direct comparison experiment to rituximab for CDC activity. CA46 cells were treated as described above with the exception of rituximab instead of anti NTB A antibody and assayed for CDC activity. The CDC activity of 480.12 was 10 200 fold higher than rituximab depending on the B cell line used D .

CDC assays were performed on cancer target cells from CLL patients. Cytotoxicity was observed in a dose dependent manner in all CLL derived samples tested with ECs ranging from 9 to 15 ng ml examples shown in B . In contrast freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were largely unaffected at these concentrations of antibodies D . These results demonstrate that NTB A mAbs are potent and selective antibodies against B cells and provide for therapeutic intervention in CLL patients. CDC assays were also performed on a chimpanzee B cell line EB176 using the chimeric mAb 994.1 9 and mAb 994.1. As can be seen in both anti NTB A antibodies were effective in vitro against the chimpanzee cell line.

ADCC assays were performed using the anti NTB A mAbs. Human NK cells were isolated from buffy coat by negative selection using Rosette Sep NK cell enrichment cocktail from Stem Cell Technologies Vancouver BC Canada according to manufacturer s instructions. Mouse splenocytes were isolated as described in Coleman et al. 29 489 498 2006 . Specific lysis of target cells was determined by using a standard 4 hr Cr release assay in a 96 well plate format as previously described Coleman et al. 2006 supra . No pre incubation step of effector cells and antibody was performed. Percent lysis was calculated using the following standard equation TEST BGD Max BGD 100 where TEST is sample release BGD is spontaneous release and Max is Triton X mediated release. Percent specific lysis has effector control subtracted. Both NTB A chimeric mAbs display ADCC activity in both human CA46 Burkitt s lymphoma cells and chimpanzee 5 KB167 B cells .

Assays were performed to determine whether the cytotoxic activity mediated by anti NTB A mAbs was dependent on the presence of NTB A on the cell membrane. HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells were stably transfected with NTB A and CDC dose response assays were carried out on these transfectants as well as on the parental line. HEK293 cells appeared to be resistant whereas HEK293 NTB A cells were sensitive to anti NTB A induced CDC . When HL 60 cells which were originally derived from a patient with acute myelocytic leukemia AML and do not express NTB A were subjected to the same assay they also appeared to be resistant . These results confirm specificity of anti NTB A mAbs expression of NTB A is necessary for the induction of CDC activity.

Human T cell enrichment was performed by negative selection using Rosette Sep T cell enrichment cocktail from Stem Cell Technologies Vancouver BC Canada according to manufacturer s instructions. Human buffy coat was supplied by Stanford University Medical School Blood Center CA. Purity of enrichment was confirmed by flow cytometry using CD3 APC BD Clone SK7 . T cells were maintained in complete medium CM RPMI 1640 medium 10 FBS 1 penicillin streptomycin at a density of 1 10cells ml. Plate bound CD3 Clone OKT3 eBiosciences San Diego Calif. USA was coated overnight at 4 C. in 200 l PBS. Plates were washed twice in PBS air dried and 100 l T cells added per well. Soluble antibody CD28 Fitzgerald Concord Mass. USA IgG2b isotype ATCC hybridoma was made up as a two fold working stock in CM and 100 l added per well. Plates were left in culture for 4 6 days then pulsed with 18.5 kBq H thymidine Perkin Elmer Waltham Mass. USA per well for approximately 18 h. Cells were harvested using a 96 well cell harvester and H thymidine incorporation was measured using a scintillation counter Packard Topcount Packard Instrumentation Company Meridan Conn. USA .

As NTB A is expressed on T cells and a mAb to NTB A has been previously shown to co activate T cell response with CD3 ligand Valdez et al 2004 supra NTB A mAbs 480.12 and 994.1 were tested in T cell activation assays. Purified T cells were incubated in the presence of various amounts of immobilized anti CD3 in combination with anti CD28 or anti NTB A antibodies. Anti CD3 alone resulted in proliferation of T cells as measured by H thymidine incorporation which was significantly enhanced by anti CD28 whereas the anti NTB A mAbs had no effect on T cell proliferation either alone or in combination with anti CD3 . Moreover NTB A mAbs did not activate the release of cytokines from T cells including interferon tumor necrosis factor interleukin 2 or interleukin 5 data not shown . These results suggest that both NTB A mAbs target a non activating epitope of NTB A.

Stained cells were read on FACSCALIBUR BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. USA FL2 setting using CELLQUEST Pro BD Biosciences .

HEK293 NTB A cells showed a sigmoidal dose response in CDC to NTB A mAb 480.12 whereas parental HEK293 cells were completely resistant to CDC by anti NTB A antibodies not shown . Transient siRNA knockdown was used to further demonstrate the specificity of the interaction. Knockdown by three different siRNAs caused a marked shift in the CDC curve and made 30 50 of the cells completely resistant to CDC whereas mock transfected or control siRNA transfected cells were the same as untransfected. Protein knockdown was confirmed by Western analysis of RIPA lysates from transfected cells as well as FACS analysis . Both the Western analysis and the FACS analysis showed good correlation between the degree of knockdown effect and the degree of resistance in the CDC assay.

In order to validate the anti NTB A mAbs in vivo xenograft models in SCID and nude mice were developed.

CA46 human Burkitt s lymphoma cells ATCC were cultured in suspension with RPMI1640 medium Invitrogen supplemented with 20 fetal bovine serum according to manufacturer s recommendation. CA46 lymphoma cells were harvested at density of 1 10cells ml of log growth phase. Harvested CA46 cells were confirmed of high viability 95 and resuspended into HBSS buffer.

Young adult female nude mice and SCID mice at age of 6 8 weeks were used Charles River Laboratory . Each mouse was subcutaneously inoculated with 1 10CA46 lymphoma cells in a volume of 100 l on the rear back of the mouse. CA46 lymphoma xenografts were allowed to establish to an average size of 50 100 mmand xenograft bearing mice were randomized into various conditional groups.

NTB A mAb was given to each mouse at designated dose via intraperitoneal ip injection at frequency of twice a week. Each mouse was measured for tumor size using a caliper on alternate days. Animal body weight and any sign of morbidity were also closely monitored. The NTB A treatment lasted for two weeks at which point mice were harvested tumor xenografts were extirpated weighed and correlated with the tumor size measurement.

Subcutaneous inoculation of 10 10CA46 cells resulted in aggressively growing tumors . Treatment of mice with various doses of 994.1 mAb after tumors were established significantly reduced tumor growth in a dose dependent manner . Treatment of nude mice with 30 g mouse 1.2 mg kg dosed twice weekly reduced tumor growth by about 60 compared to animals in the saline treated group whereas dosing at 300 g mouse 12 mg kg resulted in 90 reduction. mAb 480.12 showed a similar efficacy in this model results not shown . No significant weight loss or toxicity was observed among the experimental groups. Similar results were seen when performed with the chimeric mAbs 480.12 77 and 994.1 9 .

The efficacy of 994.1 was further examined in a disseminating model. Raji human Burkitt s lymphoma cells ATCC were cultured in suspension with RPMI1640 medium Invitrogen supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum according to the manufacturer s suggestion. Raji lymphoma cells were harvested at density of 1 10cells ml of log growth phase. Harvested Raji cells were confirmed of high viability 95 and resuspended into HBSS buffer.

Young adult female SCID mice at age of 6 8 weeks were used Charles River Laboratory . Each mouse received intravenous injection of 1 10Raji cells in a volume of 100 l to the tail vein to disseminate systemically. Administration of NTB A mAb started on the same day of Raji lymphoma cell inoculation. NTB A mAb was given to each mouse at designated dose via intraperitoneal injection at frequency of twice a week and the NTB A treatment lasted for two weeks. Mice with disseminated Raji lymphoma cells were monitored daily for the presence of hind limb paralysis. Mice exhibiting paralysis were euthanized by COasphyxiation according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC regulations.

When Daudi cells were inoculated intravenously mortality was observed in the control group by day 18 with over 90 mortality by day 26. Treatment groups showed only 10 mortality by day 26. . These results establish NTB A mAbs as effective inhibitors of tumor growth in vivo.
