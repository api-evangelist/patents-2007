The United States Government as represented by the Department of Energy has a paid up license in the invention described and may manufacture and or use this invention for governmental purposes in accordance with the terms of Contract No. DE AC52 06NA25396.

This invention relates to a low temperature process for preparing actinide nitrides for use as fuel in nuclear reactors.

With the increasing demand for energy and the pressing issues associated with CO2 emissions nuclear power is once again becoming an attractive alternative for electrical production. The generation IV reactors which are under development will run at much higher temperatures and with a much greater burn up of the fuel than the current generation of nuclear reactors. A consequence of this higher working temperature and greater burn up is a need for new fuel formulations.

There are many materials that may fit the requirements of the generation IV reactors. Oxides are relatively simple to produce and are the current materials of choice for conventional reactors. Unfortunately oxide fuels have several inherent limitations which include a relatively low fissile density that reduces the breeding ratio and poor thermal conductivity that restricts the linear heating rate. Of the alternatives nitrides represent the best combination of properties with the potential to solve these problems.

Uranium nitride has many favorable fuel properties such as a high fissile density a high melting point similar to that of oxide fuel and high thermal conductivity similar to that of metal fuel. While uranium nitride UN has many of the properties that would make it an excellent reactor fuel it has failed to make the leap to practical systems due to the difficulty in its synthesis. In particular the inclusion of carbon from the currently favored carbothermic reduction routes to UN is a major issue in the production of nitride fuels. The carbothermic synthesis relies on the conversion of the uranium carbide to the nitride at high temperatures. The high temperatures required for the UN production have unfortunate side effects in that the low vapor pressure actinides particularly americium become volatile leading to serious contamination issues.

GB 1 186 630 discloses a process for the production of uranium nitride plutonium nitride or mixtures thereof by reaction of uranium or plutonium tetrafluorides or trifluorides by high temperature ammonolysis into the corresponding higher nitride or mixture of higher nitrides which is then dissociated in vacuo into the corresponding mononitride or mixture of mononitrides. Optionally zirconium nitride can be included in the admixture.

U.S. Pat. No. 3 953 355 discloses a process for the preparation of actinide nitrides from massive actinide metal massive being a single piece of metal having a mass of 0.1 kg or more. The process involves partially hydriding the massive metal and simultaneously dehydriding and nitriding the dehydrided portion. The process is repeated until all of the massive metal is converted to a nitride.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 128 112 discloses a process of preparing an actinide nitride phosphide sulfide or oxide by admixing an actinide organometallic precursor with a suitable solvent and a protic Lewis base selected from ammonia phosphine hydrogen sulfide and water and heating the mixture until the actinide compound is formed.

B. N. Wani et al. report in 44 1989 177 185 that UO UOand ThOwere fluorinated by NHHFat room temperature to produce NH UF 2HO NH UOF HO and NH ThF 2HO respectively.

There remains a need to provide low temperature methods of preparing actinide nitrides for use as nuclear fuels.

Accordingly the present invention provides a method of preparing an actinide nitride fuel for nuclear reactors comprising the steps of a providing at least one actinide oxide and optionally zirconium oxide b mixing the oxide or oxides with a source of hydrogen fluoride for a period of time and at a temperature sufficient to convert the oxide to a fluoride salt c heating the fluoride salt to remove water d further heating the fluoride salt in a nitrogen atmosphere for a period of time and at a temperature sufficient to convert the fluoride salt to nitride and e heating the nitride under vacuum and or inert atmosphere for a period of time and at a temperature sufficient to convert the nitride to mononitride.

The present invention provides a process for producing actinide nitrides such as uranium nitride at temperatures of 1100 C. or less without carbon contamination. The method utilizes the simple conversion of oxides to fluorides and their subsequent conversion to nitrides. The process does not rely on any significant change in oxidation state of the uranium and hence does not employ carbothermic reduction.

As used herein unless otherwise expressly specified all numbers such as those expressing values ranges amounts or percentages may be read as if prefaced by the word about even if the term does not expressly appear. Any numerical range recited herein is intended to include all sub ranges subsumed therein. Plural encompasses singular and vice versa.

Actinide series elements are the fifteen chemical elements that lie between actinium and lawrencium on the periodic table with atomic numbers 89 103. Suitable actinides for use in nuclear fuels include for example thorium uranium plutonium neptunium americium and curium. Mixtures of two or more actinide oxides are preferred such as mixtures of plutonium and uranium. Mixtures of three or more actinides can also be used such as mixtures of plutonium uranium and thorium. Especially preferred are mixtures of oxides of thorium uranium plutonium neptunium americium and curium plutonium neptunium americium and curium and uranium plutonium neptunium americium and curium. In any of the above mixtures the relative amount of each actinide may vary from 0.01 100 in the mixture.

Optionally zirconium oxide can be added to the actinide oxide in amounts known in the art. Zirconium oxide is a well known stabilizer for nuclear fuels and is also used for cladding the fuel pellets. As used throughout the specification and claims oxide or oxides refers to the at least one actinide oxide which is optionally mixed with zirconium oxide. The process of the present invention thus produces at least one actinide mononitride which is optionally mixed with zirconium mononitride.

The actinide oxide or oxides are mixed with a source of hydrogen fluoride for a period of time and at a temperature sufficient to convert the oxide to a fluoride salt according to the following reaction where Act denotes actinide ActO 4NHHF NH ActF 2 HO 1 

Suitable sources of hydrogen fluoride include for example ammonium bifluoride ammonium fluoride and combinations of these. Preferably the ammonium bifluoride and or ammonium fluoride is enriched to at least 50 N with higher levels more preferred. The reaction of the oxide with hydrogen fluoride can be carried out at ambient temperature at temperatures between 20 30 C. As the temperature is increased to about 50 C. the salt is dried and water is driven off NH ActF 2 HO NH ActF 2 HO 2 

Following removal of water fluoride salt is further heated in a nitrogen atmosphere for a period of time and at a temperature sufficient to convert the fluoride salt to nitride NH ActF 2NH ActN 4NHF H 3 

Preferably the nitrogen atmosphere is ammonia. 100 ammonia is preferable for rate optimization however ammonia as a percentage in any inert carrier gas will work. The temperature used in this step of the process is between 600 1000 C. more preferably 750 850 C. and the period of time sufficient to complete the reaction is between 15 minutes to 3 hours more preferably 30 minutes to 2 hours.

After conversion to the nitride the at least one actinide nitride and optionally zirconium nitride is heated under vacuum and or inert atmosphere for a period of time and at a temperature sufficient to convert the actinide nitride to a mononitride ActN ActN N H 2HO 4 

This is accomplished at temperatures between 1000 1300 C. more preferably at temperatures between 1050 1200 C. Complete 100 conversion to the mononitride occurs within ten hours usually within 3 5 hours.

UOwas reacted with NHHFto give NH UFon a 50 g scale with a 10 excess of NHHF. Analysis of the bright green material indicates that it was mainly NH UFwith small amounts of NH UFand NH UF.

By washing the green material with large amounts of water the reaction was completed and NH UF 2HO was obtained as the exclusive product with no impurities detected. The hydrate was dried at 50 C. to give NH UFin quantitative yield 100 yield .

When the NH UFwas heated to 800 C. under NH a quantitative conversion from NH UFto a uranium nitride which analyzed as UN occurred.

For the UN x ray diffraction patterns shown in can be indexed as cubic with a 5.305034 30 . The Rietveld Refinement see Table 3 below confirmed the product as UNwith a small impurity 0.7 consisting of UO. While UNhas been previously characterized it is one of the rarer uranium nitrides with very few reports describing its preparation or properties.

The EXAFS spectrum also confirmed the known UNstructure and lattice parameters and are presented in Table 2.

An examination of the thermal stability of UNusing thermogravimetric analysis TGA indicated that a significant weight loss occurs at 1000 C. Heating the UNto 1100 C. resulted in the complete conversion to UN within 2 hours. The materials obtained for the thermal decomposition of UNwas cubic UN. The EXAFS spectrum fits the x ray data and confirms the presence of the simple UN.

Whereas particular embodiments of this invention have been described above for purpose of illustration it will be evident to those skilled in the art the numerous variations of the details of the present invention may be made without departing from the invention as defined in the appended claims.
