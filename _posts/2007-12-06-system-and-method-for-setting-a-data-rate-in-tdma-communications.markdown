The present invention relates to communications and more particularly the present invention relates to time division multiple access TDMA channel access communications systems and related methods used in wireless ad hoc communications.

Mobile ad hoc networks MANET s are becoming increasingly popular because they operate as self configuring networks of mobile routers or associated hosts connected by wireless links to form an arbitrary topology. The routers such as wireless mobile units can move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily as nodes in a network similar to a packet radio network. The individual units require minimum configuration and their quick deployment can make ad hoc networks suitable for emergency situations. For example many MANET s are designed for military systems such as the JTRS Joint Tactical Radio System and other similar peer to peer or Independent Basic Service Set systems IBSS .

TDMA technology is becoming more popular for use in these mobile ad hoc network systems. In an ad hoc network using a TDMA communications protocol channel access scheduling is a platform of the network structure. Some problems are encountered with distributed channel scheduling used in a multi hop broadcast networks. As known to those skilled in the art the optimum channel scheduling problem is equivalent to the graph coloring problem which is a well known NP complete problem cited in numerous sources. Many prior art systems assume that the network topology is known and is not topology transparent.

Physically a mobile ad hoc network includes a number of geographically distributed potentially mobile nodes sharing a common radio channel. Compared with other types of networks such as cellular networks or satellite networks the most distinctive feature of mobile ad hoc networks is the lack of any fixed infrastructure. The network may be formed of mobile nodes only and a network is created on the fly as the nodes transmit with each other. The network does not depend on a particular node and dynamically adjusts as some nodes join or others leave the network.

The standards governing Wireless Local Area Networks WLANs networking products are defined by a suite of specifications issued by the IEEE and known as the IEEE 802.11 standard incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The standards define the operation of both the radio PHY layer and the MAC layer including a synchronization mechanism. The synchronization mechanism is used to provide a uniform time base.

For ad hoc networks the timing synchronization is typically implemented using a distributed algorithm that is performed by the member nodes. Each node typically transmits beacons in accordance with an algorithm defined in the 802.11 standard. Each node adopts the timing received from any beacon or probe response that has a timing synchronization function value later than its own timer.

One principle of wireless communications environments using TDMA protocols is changes in the propagation can cause an unsophisticated protocol or waveform to cease in delivering data or effect the packet error rate PER efficiently. Usually some systems use Automatic Repeat Request ARQ algorithms that improve deliver at a cost of latency and additional network load. In some TDMA ad hoc networks it is expected that each node in the network could be moving and connections between nodes would vary in availability and quality. An adaptive data rate algorithm would maintain these link changes by optimally selecting data rate and route for successful packet delivery. The performance is typically no better than what the physical channel can handle and therefore it is desirable to determine dynamically an access point to produce a much higher performance system.

Rate adaptation has been used in past TDMA ad hoc systems such as FS 1052 and STANAG 5066 using data traffic and demodulation statistics between two nodes that currently exchange data. It is possible that some of these systems also used long term storage of previous observation results to help predict initial waveform selection. Many issues prevent a prediction mechanism using long term historical data from being successful on the first transfer attempt. As data traffic commences these algorithms adapt to track the channel depending on how fast the channel changes.

In accordance with a non limiting example of the present invention the technical problem noted above is solved and the solution achieved by adapting the physical layer waveform bit rate selection and bandwidth in real time to track the channel capacity without the use of automatic repeat request ARQ . The dynamics of the channel requires real time monitoring to allow tracking of the optimal waveform configuration resulting in higher data transfer rates allowed by the channel.

A communications system includes a plurality of N mobile nodes forming a mobile ad hoc network. A plurality of wireless communication links connects the mobile nodes together. Each mobile node includes a communications device for transmitting and routing data packets wirelessly to other mobile nodes via the wireless communication links in accordance with a time division multiple access TDMA data transmission protocol using a TDMA epoch that is divided into a beacon interval digital voice interval and digital data interval. The mobile nodes are operative for monitoring channel conditions using the beacon digital voice and digital data intervals and providing from each mobile node a network conductivity performance as valid beacon interval receptions occur within mobile nodes. A mobile node is operative for calculating a data rate for the other N 1 mobile nodes when a beacon interval is correctly received using monitored channel conditions for the beacon digital voice and digital data intervals.

A mobile node is operative for determining the signal to noise ratio SNR received signal strength indication RSSI and packet error rate PER for N 1 mobile nodes based on valid beacon interval receptions. Each mobile node can maintain a history of the SNR RSSI and PER over X second intervals for each respective N 1 node. Each X second interval can be about one to about two seconds.

A mobile node can also be operative for supplementing the history of the SNR RSSI and PER using the receptions of digital data intervals. A database can contain TDMA waveform selections and a mobile node can select a TDMA waveform from the database based on the SNR RSSI and a SNR variance.

A mobile node can transmit data at a lower data rate based on a selected TDMA waveform when a transmit slot duration allows a lower rate TDMA waveform to transmit data more robustly.

In a non limiting example of the present invention the beacon interval can be formed as a preamble and convolutional coded Gaussian minimum shift keyed GMSK data portion. The digital data voice interval can be formed as a preamble and convolutional coded Gaussian minimum shift keyed GMSK data portion that is mixed excitation linear prediction MELP encoded. The digital data interval can be formed as a preamble and one of a convolutional coded Gaussian Minimum Shift Keyed GMSK data portion turbo coded binary phase shift keyed BPSK data portion quadrature phase shift keyed QPSK data portion and 16 ary quadrature amplitude modulation QAM data portion over a plurality of bandwidths using known and unknown equalized blocks.

The description as presented below can apply with reference to flowchart illustrations of methods systems and computer program products according to an embodiment of the invention. It will be understood that blocks of the illustrations and combinations of blocks in the illustrations can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer special purpose computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine such that the instructions which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus implement the functions specified in the block or blocks.

In one aspect the beacon interval digital voice interval and digital data interval bursts are used to monitor channel conditions. During beacon receptions which are typically continuous network connectivity performance is provided from each node in the data payload as valid receptions occur. During the transmitting beacon time slot the radio can deliver its waveform recommendations for the N 1 other nodes using the previous beacon interval digital data interval and digital voice interval observations. The system using a mobile node determines the signal to noise SNR received signal strength indication RSSI and packet error rate PER and maintains history over a X second interval typically about 1 to about 2 seconds from respective N 1 nodes. The SNR SNR variance and RSSI short term history are used to select the best TDMA waveform settings from a set of multi dimensional tables. Data receptions can be used to augment the SNR RSSI and packet error statistics. During data transfers the packet error rate dominates the selection to ensure that the packet error rate is less than about 10 . The sending data node can use the waveform setting recommendation or it can use a lower rate when the transmit slot duration allows the use of a lower rate waveform to send a required data packet size more robustly.

The network nodes maintain the short term history of the suggested waveform rates and bandwidths between all nodes even when no data packets flow. The beacons are present and allow the channel conditions to be updated. The history between the nodes is real time relevant and provides the best data rate and bandwidth suggestion for a future data transfer between any network nodes. Even when channel estimates do not track the channel the highest capacity that provides less than a 10 packet error rate can be adapted. No significant memory resources are required and little processing overhead is required.

The system can be applicable to high speed packet based network solutions that allow the use of physical channel monitoring. A low complexity algorithm can be used to provide the best over the air network capacity for a given channel condition when some packet error is tolerable.

The tables as described before could include data entries for different waveforms at different bandwidths for example 1.2 MHz or 5 MHz as non limiting examples. The table could include data for the number of voice frames and data such as a one node relay and voice number. The maximum node to node throughput and system capacity in kbps could be implemented using the table. Different assumptions could apply to different throughput values such as the duration of the epoch duration of a MELP frame system capacity manner of code combining and the measurement over interval time periods.

The adaptive data rate capability as described is responsive to an on the move mobile network that is experiencing changing topology and individual link qualities. The system monitors a set of characteristics by which a node can make data rate recommendations and use those recommendations to transfer data more reliably. The data rate recommendation exchanges can occur using a normal operating network beacon. Since all nodes monitor this traffic they are capable of predicting channel quality without having to exchange any data traffic. This is an advantageous aspect when considering networks that are not loaded with data traffic will have the capability to begin transferring IP data at a more optimal data rate thus improving throughput.

The approach for adapting data rate will leverage different characteristics. For example the SNR of the GMSK waveform is estimated using the mean and variance of the soft decisions over eight frames in one non limiting example. For a DDE based waveform a KU block SNR is measured from the demodulated complex estimate distance to the decoded reference symbols. Both the GMSK and DDE SNR block estimates are then refined using a table correction. Finally the SNR estimates are averaged over the entire burst. The SNR Mean value is stored on a per node basis such that a one 1 second history is maintained.

The degree of fading can be estimated by measuring the variance of the SNR over multiple bursts. Other methods are available to estimate the fade rate accurately as known to those skilled in the art but could impact the modem s VHDL design complexity and the loading limitations available on some systems such as a waveform digital signal processor WDSP . The fading characteristics can be determined by looking at the variance of the modem s block SNR for each reception. The fading characteristic has significant impact on data performance i.e. packet errors and is characterized and used in concert with the channel SNR.

The RSSI is a measurement of receive signal strength in dBm. The RSSI strength provides an additional indicator on the maximum data rate a link can support by providing another means to estimate the receive SNR. This is helpful in mobile environments when a signal shows link margin and consistent gain or decrease in signal strength as distance from antennae changes. In a fading environment the RSSI is a better estimate of the SNR than can be estimated from the waveform alone. History of RSSI can be kept for each node over a one second interval to allow an average RSSI value to be computed.

The packet error rate PER is a measurement of the number of packets that do not clear cyclic redundancy check CRC . HP MAC assembles one or more protocol data units PDU s in a data frame with each PDU having a CRC. The PER impacts the change of data rate and is dependent on the size of each PDU and the channel bit error rate. The estimated packet error rate provides validation to the rate selection process. For example RSSI or SNR could indicate a higher data rate when the PER is greater than a desired threshold causing the algorithm system to go down in data rate. This is due in part to the difficulty in characterizing all possible channel conditions and the limited signal duration to estimate channel conditions accurately. The history of the PER can be stored for each node to which a data frame is received over the air.

It is possible to optimize the transmission of data packets to the lowest data rate that will fit the packet s into a node s data frame. This determination is made for low offered loads at the transmitting node when enhanced robustness can be obtained without effecting throughput.

The beacon PDU used for normal operation of the network can be modified to contain rate adaptation control bits Data Rate bandwidth suggestion ACK NACK status bits as shown in . This ACK NACK field can contain 36 bits in which up to 9 neighbors are informed of a node s recommended data rate selection. Each section can contain three bits for data rate bandwidths and one bit for data frame ACK status . To accommodate this increase in the beacon the Data Frame Management field was reduced in size from 40 to 32 bits. Overall the beacon size did not change. No other management messages are needed outside of the beacon PDU to exchange rate recommendations with neighboring nodes.

Each node in the network tracks the signal characteristics when the network is in operational state meaning each node has a dedicated beacon slot assignment. Every node attempts to receive each beacon so metrics will always be available each epoch. A node will calculate a recommended data rate when a beacon reception is correctly received. A one second or more history of these beacon statistics is kept to help determine more accurately the channel fading characteristic as a non limiting example. Nodes which fail to receive a beacon will not record any of the actual statistics. The history can be cleared one index at a time for each beacon that is missed. After 1 second of not receiving a node s beacon that node will have no history and be given a recommendation of the lowest data rate. In one example the beacon data rate can be fixed WF 1 or GMSK 16 chip 169 kbps and not changed by the adaptive data rate scheme.

When a node forms its beacon for transmission the node fills in a recommended data rate and ACK Status bit for nine network members as a non limiting example using a beacon ACK NAK field. The status will be inserted in a slot order with the first beacon slot in index 0 and so on. The transmitting node forming this status places the next slot location in an index location until all 9 locations are filled. The recommended data rate information includes beacon statistics from the current epoch unless recent data statistics are available. A receiving node processes each beacon containing this rate suggestion storing it based on a node address for later usage for the next data transmit. Depending on the beacon slot order this recommendation could be used in the current epoch or the next epoch. The data frame ACK bit is also set indicating if the last reception was received error free otherwise it is cleared. It is possible for this bit to be used in ARQ scheme in the future when reliable data delivery is implemented.

A node that has traffic to send can use the last rate recommended by the receiving node although an exception could be made when sending internal OLSR traffic which is sent at a fixed rate to ensure its robustly delivered. If there is insufficient data packets queued to fill an entire frame at the recommended rate the data rate can be lowered to allow the most robust transfer that will fit the data packets into the data frame. This determination can be made when forming the node s beacon for transmission. If the destination node s beacon is not received the recommended data rate used by the transmitting node can be decreased to that node to account for a deteriorating link between the two nodes. This decrease can occur after about five consecutive beacon misses.

A node receiving data traffic can monitor the reception characteristics described above to form a data rate recommendation to the sending node in the next beacon. Statistics gathered as a result of a data frame reception can supersede that of a beacon since the data reception has substantially more gathered statistics including the packet error rate. The system can use two methods for determining data rate. One can be used for beacons and the other for data frames. show the high level diagrams.

It is possible to improve the next hop route selection in a situation where a node needs to relay traffic through another node to reach the intended destination. An Optimal Link State Routing OLSR protocol can be used to pick the shortest route. When there are multiple routes to choose from OLSR picks the lowest address. This default selection does not factor into account route quality. With the addition of the adaptive data rate a node has a potential mechanism to determine route choice using data rate recommendations from each of the next hop nodes. In an adaptive data rate approach the system could propagate channel metrics either a data rate 0 6 or a RSSI using the OLSR messages that are transmitted across the network .

A straightforward mechanism adds to OLSR such that a one 1 relay route can be chosen based on best quality. The adaptive data rate feature is operable and monitoring the network s beacon and data traffic. This can then be given to OLSR for route selection. In addition these quality metrics can be communicated in the OLSR HELLO messages through a slight increase in size of eight bits per link message. A link message is sent for each node that is one hop away.

Initially the node to node quality for the one hop neighborhood can be known from the adaptive data rate statistics. After HELLO messages are exchanged and each node determines its two hop neighbors the quality information will be complete to allow a more optimal route to be determined. HELLO messages can be sent every two seconds including that the precise channel estimates will be delayed in regards to how OLSR will choose the route.

OLSR on each epoch can update local one hop quality measurements by HP MAC. Route choices would be recalculated and all future traffic route selection will be impacted.

OLSR tracks two hop metrics and can be enhanced to track two quality metrics per node in its routing table. Each of these quality metrics represents a directional path from two nodes allowing each node to have quality metrics from all of its two hop neighbors. These metrics are communicated using the link message portion of the HELLO message that is sent every two seconds. It is envisioned that four bits are necessary for each direction for a total increase of eight bits. This addition would extend the node information field from 24 bits address to 32 bits. One bit would be reserved for potential future capability to constrain route choice either through a static decision or due to traffic saturation or low battery life. As a future enhancement topology messages could also have the same information such that the entire network link quality could be factored into route choice.

Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7 085 539 the disclosure which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety is an example of a system and method that can characterize a communications channel with respect to signal to noise ratio SNR time dispersion or multi path and frequency dispersion or Doppler spread. Such system could be adapted and modified for use in the system as described. A probe signal modulator can receive a probe signal transmitted on a wireless communication channel and generate a demodulated probe signal. A probe signal remodulator can generate a replica probe signal. A delay unit can generate a delayed probe signal and an adaptive canceller can receive the delayed probe signal and generate a residual noise signal and channel characterization signal. A channel characterization block can receive the channel characterization signal and the residual noise signal to generate channel measurements of the wireless communication channel.

There now follows details of an algorithm description in accordance with a non limiting example of the present invention.

For each an array of packet count and packet error count history is maintained. The current packet packet error history length is 8 pdus not including beacons.

Each time a packet is found in a received PDU the packet count for the current rx pdu is incremented.

Each time a packet is found and the CRC fails the packet error count for the current rx pdu is incremented.

Packets and errors are only counted when the received pdu matches the last recommended data rate and bandwidth.

When a missed acquisition is detected matching the last datarate and bandwidth a single packet and packet error are counted for the current epoch.

When transec detects an invalid pdu length greater than max allowed currently 2000 bytes it logs a single packet error.

Each time a block of soft decisions is ready to go to the Viterbi Coprocessor VCP the burst SNR and RSSI is passed to the ADR. This may happen more than once for a single rx pdu if it is a big block.

The RSSI estimate is obtained from the AGC lookup table address which is read once when the waveform dsp is interrupted for the modem rx active event.

The SNR estimate accumulates over the entire burst so the last value passed to ADR will have been averaged over the largest number of samples.

Rx EOM Due to the way the ADR information is not available at a convenient single point in time for a given rx pdu the packet packet error rssi and snr information is asynchronously passed to ADR as it becomes available.

When the last frame of decoded data or only frame is ready to be sent to modem dsp the PhyAdrEom is called. This call informs ADR that the current rx pdu is done. This increments the data history buffer index.

1 It is desirable to average metrics and packet errors received at the recommended rate to avoid biasing the estimates with information from lower data rates and IF bandwidths and

2 After making a change to the recommended waveform the system must wait for the recommended waveform to be received before making additional changes because the system needs to flush the statistics from the previous waveform as they are invalid once the data rate changes.

Last epoch rx is used to determine how many epochs have passed since the last data pdu was received. Data metrics are preferred for adapting over beacon metrics but if data has not been received in a long time the system must use beacon metrics. Receipt of OLSR packets would cause the system to have recent data but not for the correct rate. OLSR packets provide no way for ADR to determine that they are special i.e. they look like data from a particular node id at the beacon WF ID. The current method to know that data has not been received in a long time is to log epoch count if the pdu was sent with the recommended Waveform ID.

RSSI and SNR metrics are passed to ADR whether or not any packets within the PDU pass CRC or are even found by the transec decoder corrupt transec SOM pattern .

OLSR When OLSR is received the metrics only stored if it is received using the same waveform id as the last recommended rate. Otherwise the information is discarded.

DV Digital Voice is treated the same as data if the last recommended rate matches the DV waveform the SNR and RSSI may be used.

Each time a Viterbi or turbo coded decode block Interleaver Frame is done decoding and ready to be sent to the modem dsp a recommendation is provided. For big blocks this will happen more than once per rx pdu. There is no interface to the modem dsp for No Recommendation Every pdu sent to the modem dsp crunches through the ADR decision rules and outputs a recommendation.

Each time a data rate is recommended if Last epoch rx for the source node id is within the last 23 epochs 3 seconds a data based recommendation is used else beacon based recommendation.

Beacon Average SNR and SNR Variance is a moving average of the SNR from the last 8 beacons that passed CRC. No accounting for missed acquisitions or network reorganization is made.

After changing the data rate based on beacon information rate change is held off for 23 epochs 3 seconds to prevent thrashing of the rate due to the high variance of the beacon SNR estimate.

The SNR average and variance estimate changes its average length to allow for fast attack when good metrics are present but also to give a better SNR estimate in rapidly fading conditions. After making a rate change ADR is held off from making further changes until 8 samples have been accumulated. Once 8 samples have accumulated an 8 sample average and variance estimate is used for checking some rate increase rules. After a full 16 samples have accumulated the longer average is used instead. Increasing data rate based on an observed increase in average SNR from the initial average SNR at a given data rate is prevented from running until the full 16 samples have been accumulated.

For purposes of description some background information on coding interleaving and an exemplary wireless mobile radio communications system that includes ad hoc capability and can be modified for use is set forth. This example of a communications system that can be used and modified for use with the present invention is now set forth with regard to .

An example of a radio that could be used with such system and method is the software defined Falcon III Manpack radio manufactured and sold by Harris Corporation of Melbourne Florida. This type of radio can support multiple bandwidths from 30 MHz up to 2 GHz including L band SATCOM and MANET. The waveforms can provide secure IP data networking. It should be understood that different radios can be used including software defined radios that can be typically implemented with relatively standard processor and hardware components. One particular class of software radio is the Joint Tactical Radio JTR which includes relatively standard radio and processing hardware along with any appropriate waveform software modules to implement the communication waveforms a radio will use. JTR radios also use operating system software that conforms with the software communications architecture SCA specification which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The SCA is an open architecture framework that specifies how hardware and software components are to interoperate so that different manufacturers and developers can readily integrate the respective components into a single device.

The Joint Tactical Radio System JTRS Software Component Architecture SCA defines a set of interfaces and protocols often based on the Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA for implementing a Software Defined Radio SDR . In part JTRS and its SCA are used with a family of software re programmable radios. As such the SCA is a specific set of rules methods and design criteria for implementing software re programmable digital radios.

The JTRS SCA specification is published by the JTRS Joint Program Office JPO . The JTRS SCA has been structured to provide for portability of applications software between different JTRS SCA implementations leverage commercial standards to reduce development cost reduce development time of new waveforms through the ability to reuse design modules and build on evolving commercial frameworks and architectures.

The JTRS SCA is not a system specification as it is intended to be implementation independent but a set of rules that constrain the design of systems to achieve desired JTRS objectives. The software framework of the JTRS SCA defines the Operating Environment OE and specifies the services and interfaces that applications use from that environment. The SCA OE comprises a Core Framework CF a CORBA middleware and an Operating System OS based on the Portable Operating System Interface POSIX with associated board support packages. The JTRS SCA also provides a building block structure defined in the API Supplement for defining application programming interfaces APIs between application software components.

The JTRS SCA Core Framework CF is an architectural concept defining the essential core set of open software Interfaces and Profiles that provide for the deployment management interconnection and intercommunication of software application components in embedded distributed computing communication systems. Interfaces may be defined in the JTRS SCA Specification. However developers may implement some of them some may be implemented by non core applications i.e. waveforms etc. and some may be implemented by hardware device providers.

For purposes of description only a brief description of an example of a communications system that includes communications devices is described relative to a non limiting example shown in .

A transmitter is shown at and includes basic functional circuit components or modules including a forward error correction encoder that includes a puncturing module which could be integral to the encoder or a separate module. The decoder and its puncturing module includes a function for repeating as will be explained below. Encoded data is interleaved at an interleaver for example a block interleaver and in many cases modulated at modulator . This modulator can map the communications data into different symbols based on a specific mapping algorithm to form a communications signal. For example it could form Minimum Shift Keying or Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying MSK or GMSK symbols. Other types of modulation could be used in accordance with non limiting examples of the present invention. Up conversion and filtering occurs at an up converter and filter which could be formed as an integrated module or separate modules. Communications signals are transmitted for example wirelessly to receiver .

At the receiver down conversion and filtering occurs at a down converter and filter which could be integrated or separate modules. The signal is demodulated at demodulator and deinterleaved at deinterleaver . The deinterleaved data i.e. bit soft decisions is decoded and depunctured for punctured codes combined for repeated codes and passed through for standard codes at decoder which could include a separate or integrated depuncturing module. The system apparatus and method can use different modules and different functions. These components as described could typically be contained within one transceiver.

It should be understood in one non limiting aspect of the present invention a rate K 7 convolutional code can be used as an industry standard code for forward error correction FEC during encoding. For purposes of understanding a more detailed description of basic components now follows. A convolutional code is an error correcting code and usually has three parameters n k m with n equal to the number of output bits k equal to the number of input bits and m equal to the number of memory registers in one non limiting example. The quantity k n could be called the code rate with this definition and is a measure of the efficiency of the code. K and n parameters can range from 1 to 8 m can range from 2 to 10 and the code rate can range from to in non limiting examples. Sometimes convolutional code chips are specified by parameters n k L with L equal to the constraint length of the code as L k m 1 . Thus the constraint length can represent the number of bits in an encoder memory that would affect the generation of n output bits. Sometimes the letters may be switched depending on the definitions used.

The transformation of the encoded data is a function of the information symbols and the constraint length of the code. Single bit input codes can produce punctured codes that give different code rates. For example when a rate code is used the transmission of a subset of the output bits of the encoder can convert the rate code into a rate code. Thus one hardware circuit or module can produce codes of different rates. Punctured codes allow rates to be changed dynamically through software or hardware depending on channel conditions such as rain or other channel impairing conditions.

An encoder for a convolutional code typically uses a look up table for encoding which usually includes an input bit as well as a number of previous input bits known as the state of the encoder the table value being the output bit or bits of the encoder. It is possible to view the encoder function as a state diagram a tree diagram or a trellis diagram.

Decoding systems for convolutional codes can use 1 sequential decoding or 2 maximum likelihood decoding also referred to as Viterbi decoding which typically is more desirable. Sequential decoding allows both forward and backward movement through the trellis. Viterbi decoding as maximum likelihood decoding examines a receive sequence of given length computes a metric for each path and makes a decision based on the metric.

Puncturing convolutional codes is a common practice in some systems and is used in accordance with non limiting examples of the present invention. It should be understood that in some examples a punctured convolutional code is a higher rate code obtained by the periodic elimination of specific code bits from the output of a low rate encoder. Punctured convolutional code performance can be degraded compared with original codes but typically the coding rate increases.

Some of the basic components that could be used as non limiting examples of the present invention include a transmitter that incorporates a convolutional encoder which encodes a sequence of binary input vectors to produce the sequence of binary output vectors and can be defined using a trellis structure. An interleaver for example a block interleaver can permute the bits of the output vectors. The interleaved data would also be modulated at the transmitter by mapping to transmit symbols and transmitted. At a receiver a demodulator demodulates the signal.

A block deinterleaver recovers the bits that were interleaved. A Viterbi decoder could decode the deinterleaved bit soft decisions to produce binary output data.

Often a Viterbi forward error correction module or core is used that would include a convolutional encoder and Viterbi decoder as part of a radio transceiver as described above. For example if the constraint length of the convolutional code is 7 the encoder and Viterbi decoder could support selectable code rates of 6 7 using industry standard puncturing algorithms.

Different design and block systems parameters could include the constraint length as a number of input bits over which the convolutional code is computed and a convolutional code rate as the ratio of the input to output bits for the convolutional encoder. The puncturing rate could include a ratio of input to output bits for the convolutional encoder using the puncturing process for example derived from a rate code.

The Viterbi decoder parameters could include the convolutional code rate as a ratio of input to output bits for the convolutional encoder. The puncture rate could be the ratio of input to output bits for the convolutional encoder using a puncturing process and can be derived from a rate mother code. The input bits could be the number of processing bits for the decoder. The Viterbi input width could be the width of input data i.e. soft decisions to the Viterbi decoder. A metric register length could be the width of registers storing the metrics. A trace back depth could be the length of path required by the Viterbi decoder to compute the most likely decoded bit value. The size of the memory storing the path metrics information for the decoding process could be the memory size. In some instances a Viterbi decoder could include a First In First Out FIFO buffer between depuncture and Viterbi function blocks or modules. The Viterbi output width could be the width of input data to the Viterbi decoder.

The encoder could include a puncturing block circuit or module as noted above. Usually a convolutional encoder may have a constraint length of 7 and take the form of a shift register with a number of elements for example 6. One bit can be input for each clock cycle. Thus the output bits could be defined by a combination of shift register elements using a standard generator code and be concatenated to form an encoded output sequence. There could be a serial or parallel byte data interface at the input. The output width could be programmable depending on the punctured code rate of the application.

A viterbi decoder in non limiting examples could divide the input data stream into blocks and estimate the most likely data sequence. Each decoded data sequence could be output in a burst. The input and calculations can be continuous and require four clock cycles for every two bits of data in one non limiting example. An input FIFO can be dependent on a depuncture input data rate.

It should also be understood that the present invention is not limited to convolutional codes and similar FEC but also turbo codes could be used as high performance error correction codes or low density parity check codes that approach the Shannon limit as the theoretical limit of maximum information transfer rate over a noisy channel. Thus some available bandwidth can be increased without increasing the power of the transmission. Instead of producing binary digits from the signal the front end of the decoder could be designed to produce a likelihood measure for each bit.
