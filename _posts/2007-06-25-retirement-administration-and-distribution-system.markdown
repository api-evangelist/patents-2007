Upon START the process invokes an action on an object Block . For example a user e.g. PT staff may open a page to enter address of a client set up a beneficiary to compute the death benefit if the deceased member is eligible to retire etc. Next the process determines if the action involves a business rule Block . If not the process is terminated. Otherwise the process applies the business rule Block . For example if the user enters the address of a client the action may involve an address rule e.g. address rules as shown in . Therefore the address rule may be applied.

Then the process determines if the action follows the business rule Block . For example if the user enters more than one active contact data of each type of contact information the action may not follow one of the contact information rules which prohibit multiple active contact data. If the action follows the business rule the process processes or performs the business rule Block and is then terminated. Otherwise the process reports an error or displays a warning message Block and is then terminated.

The address rules may include rules to allow a client to have multiple addresses to assign a type of an address to allow a client to have only one active or current address of each type to use a mailing address provided in the employment and payroll database as a default address and to allow an inactive address to be re activated.

The distribution accounts are the heart of the Pension Trust s distribution of retirement and benefit payments. They exist for anyone receiving a recurring or one time payment from the Pension Trust. This does not apply to payment of administrative expenses which are handled outside this system.

The distribution account rules may include rules to allow a client to have accrual accounts and distribution accounts at the same time to allow a client to have multiple distribution accounts to allow one or more accrual accounts to contribute to the retirement distribution account to allow a distribution account to be divided manually by an operator between a retiree and an alternate payee to subject the distribution accounts to COLA increases to allow an operator to schedule a one time payment outside of the PT payroll schedule to default the recurring allowances and benefits to the monthly pension trust payroll schedule to default the recurring payments to no stop date to designate primary and contingent beneficiaries for a periodic distribution with defined exceptions to prohibit beneficiaries to name a beneficiary for a beneficiary allowance to prohibit a survivor to name a beneficiary for a survivor continuance allowance to provide a message to the operator after modifying beneficiary information for beneficiaries associated with a retiree receiving option 2 or 3 retirement benefits reminding the operator to recalculate the allowance to limit industrial disabilities to members in Safety new collective bargaining agreements to provide a notification when a customer who receives a 10.06 payment has a change in salary which allows the operator to recalculate and implement an offset transaction to the 10.06 payment to use the payment address type a default address time if there is no payment address type entered the system as a default address rule for mailing physical check payments to allow deductions and allocations to be taken from the distribution payment and to select a distribution account detailed summary if there is only one in the distribution account detailed summary dropdown list or to select a distribution account detailed summary as selected by the user.

Regarding the manual division rule such a split results in two separate distribution accounts. The operator makes a notation on the alternate payee account regarding contributing accrual accounts as there is no link and manually adjust the retire allowance and set up the alternate payee allowance.

The pension trust applies interest to accrual account balances i.e. contributions plus interest in accrual accounts belonging to members alternate payees reserve and reciprocal reserve participants. The pension trust applies interest on a pay period schedule but not on the most recent pay roll feed since funds need to be on deposit for a pay period before interest is applied. Interest jobs are however dependent on payroll feeds being successfully accepted and contributions posted. They therefore follow a linear schedule. However the actual date the interest job was run could vary and is controlled by the PT.

The accrual accounts interest rules may include rules to compute the effective date that the interest shows to be the pay date plus one day to apply interest calculations to accrual account balances of normal and additional contributions and previously posted interest including buyback transactions and adjustments that have been posted up to the day before the effective date to apply interest on qualifying funds in accrual accounts for members reserve participants alternate payees and reciprocal reserve participants to apply interest to all qualifying accounts whether or not contributions were received for the member in the payroll period for which the interest job is run such as when the member is on Leave Without Pay LWOP to prevent interest from being posted out of order and to prevent interest from being posted on a subsequent payroll if the previous payroll s has not been accepted and interest applied.

The pension trust requires the ability to allocate distribution payments to the destinations indicated by a plan participant or a court order. Payments may be made with a physical check or via electronic fund transfer to the plan participant and or a payee that they designate. There are two types of allocations allocations to the participant s own accounts and allocations to third parties. Allocations to a participant s own accounts may be accomplished by ACH or by physical check. Allocations to third parties may be by physical check. For example a participant may elect to split the deposit of his her monthly payment between multiple bank accounts e.g. their own . There may also be a need to allocate part of the same payment to court ordered child or spousal support lien or other type of garnishment. The allocations rules include at least one of a system level allocation rule to prioritize allocations along with deductions at the system level by the administrator and an account level allocation rule to prioritize allocations at the individual distribution account level by an operator with the proper role assigned along with deductions.

Banking information supports electronic fund transfer of payments to a client. It includes current ACH bank information and instructions for distribution of funds between client bank accounts. The banking information rules may include rules to 

The beneficiary information allows the PT to associate a beneficiary with the benefactor client record.

The operator determines eligibility. The beneficiary information rules may include rules to

A cost of living adjustment COLA may be applied on a yearly basis to decrease or increase monthly allowances being paid from a benefit distribution account at a percentage determined by the Board of Trustees. COLAs are not applied to 10.06 allowances in lieu of disability. A maximum annual adjustment defined by the plan e.g. 3 determines how much of the increase or decrease is applied against the allowance being paid from a benefit distribution account. The cost of living adjustment COLA rules may include rules to 

Pension trust customers may designate beneficiaries to receive death benefits in the event of death. The customers may be members alternate payees reserve participants or reciprocal reserve participants with funds in their accrual accounts or retired participants who are recipients of service disability industrial disability retirement allowances or beneficiaries or eligible survivors who receive survivor continuances. Typically the PT staff receives notification of a death or a request to estimate death benefits . The PT staff then determines the participant s account status and roughly calculates the amount that will be received. If recording an actual death the PT will calculate the final payment s due from the pension trust if any provide official notification to the survivor beneficiary s with a settlement form for indicating payout option depending on the scenario and distribute the benefits on receipt of the settlement form. The death recording rules may include rules to

If the eligible survivor is also named beneficiary pay the actuarially reduced option two allowance see original calculations . If the survivor is a dependent child attaining 18 years of age the recurring death benefit is subsequently reduced to an amount option 2 allowance 50 of the unmodified allowance pay the beneficiary named for the 1000.00 death benefit the 1000.00 death benefit.

Deceased Retiree with an Option Three Allowance If there is no eligible survivor or beneficiary pay the 1000 death benefit to the estate. If there is a named beneficiary for the option 3 benefit but no eligible survivor pay 50 of the Option Three retirement allowance pay the beneficiary named for the 1000.00 death benefit the 1000.00 death benefit. If there is a named beneficiary for the option 3 benefit and an eligible survivor could be different people pay the eligible survivor a recurring death benefit 50 of the unmodified allowance 50 of COLAs received pay the beneficiary the option three allowance less the payment awarded to the eligible survivor 2 pay the beneficiary named for the 1000.00 death benefit the 1000.00 death benefit. If the eligible survivor is also named beneficiary pay 50 of the unmodified Allowance plus 0.5 option three total allowance less 50 of the unmodified Allowance . If the survivor is a dependent child attaining 18 years of age the recurring death benefit is subsequently reduced to an amount option 3 allowance 50 of the unmodified allowance 

Deceased Eligible Spouse receiving a Survivor Allowance If the eligible spouse is was receiving a benefit due to death before retirement of an active member then the eligible surviving children receive the survivor continuance until the youngest one turns 18. If at that time the total benefits paid are less than the amount of the original basic death benefit BDB then the remainder of the BDB is paid to the children or estate in a lump sum. If the total amount paid through the date of the survivor s death is greater than the original BDB the monthly payments cease. If the eligible spouse was receiving the survivor continuance benefit as a result of death of a retired participant then the payment of survivor benefit ceases on the date of the survivors death.

The pension trust supports the deduction of health insurance premiums for medical dental and vision care from the monthly disability or retirement payment. Pension trust staff will determine if retired participants and or beneficiaries are eligible to enroll in the health plans offered through the county.

The re hire calculations and conversions rules may include rules to notify of a rehire review pay period history identify missing PTSC for full and or partial pay periods based on PTSC for planned normal hours for the time type in the employer group that laid off the member and calculate PTSC for the lay off period.

During the new hire process PT staff may identify what accrual and distribution accounts exist ed to determine next functions. If the new hire process was omitted the operator will have a notification that an accrual account is received for new employment for which there was no pending member record providing another opportunity to review the accounts. The operator may then analyze if PTSC need to be adjusted for a former laid off client with accrual account balances returning to employment with any employer group under the pension trust plan within 12 months of layoff. They may also determine if it is a returning suspense member who may pay interest. If the returning employee had previous service under the plan that had been refunded the system should so indicate that as well.
