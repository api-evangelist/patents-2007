title: Independent bi-directional margin control per level and independently expandable reference cell levels for flash memory sensing
abstract: A memory system includes reference level generators that may provide programmable margins, and programmable verify voltage levels. The reference levels may be shifted within a range of voltages with varying differences between reference voltage levels and with different margins and verify levels.
