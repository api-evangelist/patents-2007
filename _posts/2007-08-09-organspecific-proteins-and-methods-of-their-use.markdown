The present invention relates generally to organ specific proteins and polynucleotides that encode them. In particular the invention relates to diagnostic and prognostic panels sets and individual agents comprising reagents or probes to detect organ specific proteins or polynucleotides and methods of identifying and using organ specific proteins.

The ability to monitor normal health and to detect the onset of disease at a very early and treatable stage is critical to diagnostic medicine. Early detection for most diseases including diseases of the lung cardiovascular disease cancer hematological disease including most hematological cancers inflammatory disorders metabolic disease and neurological disease may permit treatment at an earlier stage that will produce healthier and typically more successful outcomes for the patient. Accordingly there is a great need for more sensitive and accurate assays and methods to measure health and detect disease and monitor treatment at earlier stages.

Diagnostic assays are often incapable of identifying truly informative proteins for analyses and to be useful often require significant changes in protein composition in for example blood at the cellular level to detect the presence of disease or to define a change in health from normal. Current diagnostic assays may not detect disease until it has progressed to a stage where it is too late for effective treatment. For example most cancers may be cured if diagnosed at the earliest stage. If cancer is diagnosed at later or advanced stages effective treatment may be difficult or impossible and lead to reduced patient survival. In general current diagnostic assays have severe limitations that prevent early detection and diagnosis.

In the context of blood protein diagnostics the major impediment to use in the early detection of disease is that most proteins are not disease specific in that multiple organs synthesize them and different diseases may perturb their expression in different ways. Moreover the specific proteins that are released in the disease state that are markers of the disease may be difficult to identify or to measure because of the enormous dynamic range of protein expression in the blood and because of the enormous protein complexity in the blood. These proteins must be distinguished from other protein markers found in the blood that are not likely to be disease markers. Other protein markers that are present in the blood that are not typically considered indicators of disease include proteins released due to cellular damage normal cellular turnover stress responses liver proteins or other slight protein changes in the plasma. Additionally 22 proteins constitute about 99 of the total blood protein mass. Indeed one protein albumin comprises about 51 of this total blood protein mass. Most of these abundant blood proteins are not useful diagnostic markers. Useful diagnostic proteins are present in much lower abundance and typically in 1 of the remaining proteins Lee et al. 2006 10 1 8 . Many proteins are released into the blood following physiological changes from normal to the disease state and are likely present in plasma as low abundance proteins. Furthermore blood proteins exhibit large differences in the concentration of the most abundant and least abundant proteins that range over many orders of magnitude. Proteins are expressed in blood across a range of about 10between the numbers of proteins. This means that one protein may be present at one copy in a given volume of blood whereas another may be present at 10copies Anderson and Anderson 2002 1 845 . Low abundance proteins may be hidden or dwarfed by the more prevalent high abundance proteins. Additionally many proteins that are low abundance proteins are not indicative of disease. Distinguishing between the low abundance proteins that indicate disease from the low abundance proteins that are found in the normal cellular state is a major challenge to modern protein diagnostics. A major obstacle in diagnostic protein analysis of the blood is the numerous blood proteins and an inability by current methods to distinguish proteins from one another. Determining which blood proteins are predictive of disease at the earliest stages is very difficult at best because the diagnostician must distinguish which low abundance protein is a marker of disease within the mass of proteins that are circulating in the blood.

Different approaches for identifying blood proteins are known in the art and have been used with varying and limited degrees of success. In particular two dimensional gel electrophoresis 2 DE has been used for analysis of proteomic patterns in blood but it is difficult to resolve large numbers of proteins such as are expressed in the average cell up to 10 000 proteins . Moreover 2 DE is incapable of identifying low abundance proteins without enrichment techniques. Another method known in the art for blood protein diagnostics is capillary isoelectric focusing electrophoresis CGE although the lack of reproducibility of protein patterns limits its use Corthals G. L. et al. 1997 18 317 Lopez M. F. and W. F. Patton 1997 18 338 . Consequently protein pattern analysis using techniques such as 2 DE CGE and other similar techniques cannot generally be used for the analysis of blood proteins due to the inability to detect very low abundance proteins irreproducible gel patterns and the inability to quantify or identify individual spots e.g. proteins . Further the ability to extend these techniques to reproducible consistent easy to use and accurate high throughput diagnostic assays has been extremely limited. Thus current assays that detect proteins do not provide the accuracy to use levels of blood or other biological fluid or tissue proteins polypeptides or nucleic acids to monitor health and disease.

It is evident that a new diagnostic strategy is needed to distinguish between the many proteins that are found in the blood that reflect the normal health of a mammal and the organ specific proteins that reflect a state of disease.

The present invention relates generally to organ specific proteins and polynucleotides that encode them. In particular the invention relates to diagnostic panels comprising reagents to detect organ specific proteins or polynucleotides and methods of identifying and using the same.

Because the blood bathes all of the organs of the body the blood contains as noted above proteins that are secreted leaked excreted or shed from the cells of all the organs in the body. These proteins can provide information about the organs and serve as reporter groups or markers that accurately reflect the health or disease state of each organ or groups of organs. This is because under ordinary conditions the levels of these organ specific proteins secreted or shed into the blood may attain normal levels whereas under disease conditions the levels of the proteins may change reflecting the altered behavior e.g. control of protein expression of the disease perturbed networks in the disease organ. Thus the levels or organ specific proteins in the blood will be altered with health and disease and indeed may be specifically altered for each type of disease for a particular organ and each stage of progression for each disease. Highly sensitive blood protein diagnostics of organ specific fingerprints could be used to detect the early stages of disease and monitor treatment when therapeutic intervention is most effective. Specific proteins in blood may be used as markers to diagnose disease at the earliest stages. Expression array studies have shown that such proteins or protein panels exist in cells and can serve as markers of disease progression or disease prognosis E. E. Schadt et al. 2005 37 710 H. Dai et al. 2005 65 4059 . However specifically identifying such proteins has proved difficult. Particularly when attempting to detect those proteins that are tissue or organ specific as well as secreted.

A systems view of disease is predicated upon a very simple idea that disease arises from biological networks that have been disease perturbed either by gene mutations or pathogenic environmental signals e.g. infections . These perturbed networks alter the expression levels of proteins they encode and these lead to the pathological symptoms of disease. Furthermore a fraction of these proteins are expressed only by the organ of interest are organ specific and it is postulated are secreted or shed or deposited after cell destruction etc into the blood with distinct levels that correlate with health and each type of disease occurring in the organ. Thus each human organ or tissue type has a unique molecular fingerprint in the blood comprising distinct levels of organ specific proteins. Blood itself may be considered an organ that circulates throughout the body and is in contact with all other organs and the protein concentrations or the organ specific fingerprints serve as a diagnostic vehicle to measure the state of health or disease of a subject. Although blood is a medium to measure the state of health and disease significant limitations exist with current diagnostic assays that delay or prevent early diagnosis when it would be most effective.

Early diagnosis of disease by measuring changes in proteins in the blood would lead to earlier treatment and therefore healthier outcomes for patients. The determination of predetermined normal ranges of low abundance proteins in healthy organs gives diagnosticians a crucial advantage in health care the potential to define disease at the earliest stages and initiate treatment when it may be most effective. If the organ specific proteins that are normally found within a healthy organ could be identified and measured the diagnostician would have the distinct advantage of comparing a patient sample to a set of expected normal values of blood proteins that are typically found in a state of health in an organ.

This invention pre defines normal organ specific protein sets specifically identified and quantified for each of multiple healthy human organs and major tissue types. These organ specific proteins identified from healthy human organs may in whole or in part be used as markers or identifiers for health and disease. The levels of these organ specific proteins in blood from diseased individuals may be distinguished from the levels of these organ specific proteins in the blood of healthy individuals. By identifying organ specific protein markers and measuring the level of these proteins in normal blood the status of health or disease may be monitored through the correlation of the levels of proteins in this organ specific fingerprint at the earliest stages of disease and lead to early diagnosis and treatment.

Thus the present invention provides organ specific proteins that serve as markers to measure changes in the status of an organ or organs to measure health and diagnose disease. The inventive markers obtained from normal healthy organ tissue see Tables 1 32 36 45 and 47 79 are used as a library of biological indicators to identify organ specific blood proteins that are secreted leaked excreted or shed into blood in a human or mammal. Such markers can be used individually or collectively. For example a single marker for an organ or tissue could be used to monitor that organ or tissue. However adding additional markers from that tissue to the assay will improve the diagnostic power as well as the sensitivity of the assay. Further one of skill in the art can readily appreciate that probes to such markers be they nucleic acid probes nanoparticles or polypeptides e.g. antibodies can comprise a kit lateral flow test kit or an array and can include a few probes to proteins from several organs or several probes to proteins from one organ or tissue. For example in one kit or assay device a whole body health assay may be used wherein several markers are tracked for every organ and when one or more organ or tissue demonstrates a deviation from normal a more rigorous test is performed with many more markers for that organ or tissue. Likewise entire organ set assays may be devised. In such an example a cardiovascular assay may be employed wherein tissue organ specific markers from heart and lung are the basis of the assay kit.

One of skill in the art can readily appreciate that the application of these marker sets that are tissue and organ specific are virtually limitless. From using as diagositic and prognostic indicators to use in following drug treatment or in drug discovery to determine what proteins and genes are affected. Further such markers can easily be used in combination with antibodies for other ligands for drug targeting or imaging via MRI or PET or by other means. In such examples a marker specific for prostate could form the basis for targeted cancer therapy or possible imaging therapy of metastatic cancer derived from prostate. The comparison of the normal levels of organ specific proteins to the levels of these proteins found in a sample of patient blood or bodily fluid or other biological sample such as a biopsy can be used to define normal health detect the early stages of disease monitor treatment prognosticate disease measure drug responses titrate administered drug doses evaluate efficacy stratify patients according to disease type e.g. prostate cancer may well have four or more major types and define therapeutic targets when therapeutic intervention is most effective. This invention provides pre defined normal organ specific proteins and protein sets that have been specifically identified and quantified for each of 32 or more healthy human organs examined. These organ specific proteins identified from healthy human organs may be used as markers or identifiers for health and disease and or may be distinguished from constitutive proteins in the blood fluid or tissue. By using the approach of comparing the proteins found in a sample of blood with the organ specific protein markers that have been identified as specific to a healthy organ the status of health or disease may be monitored at the earliest stage and lead to early diagnosis and treatment.

When there is a change in health status that affects an organ the blood fingerprint that is measured is reflective of the particular target organ. Proteins that comprise the organ specific blood fingerprint will either increase or decrease in level in response to the changes brought by the stimulus of the disease. The increase or decrease in the amount in blood or components specific for a cell tissue or organ of the components of the organ specific blood fingerprint may be quantified by antibodies or other specific protein capture agents specific for the proteins by proteomic techniques e.g. mass spectrometry or by measurement with microfluidic and or nanotechnology sensors and compared to the normal level of the organ specific proteins. The disease perturbed networks may alter the expression patterns of virtually any different type of proteins those involved in signal transduction pathways those involved in the execution of cellular differentiation those involved in the response to physiological stimuli those involved in the normal cellular functions such as the cell cycle etc and those involved in mediating whom cells will interact with or where they will migrate. When disease strikes an organ the physical response may for example involve changes in the proteins that connect together in biological signal transduction networks to send information to other protein effector proteins also altering their levels of expression. These signal transduction pathways communicate changes in the body in response to a stimulus or disease. These signal transduction pathways also serve as a response network to a stimulus or disease. An example of a response network to a disease is the inflammatory pathway mediated by Phospholipase A2 PLA2 . PLA2 is modulated and may be used as a marker in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease Sudhir K. 2005 90 3100 5 arteriosclerosis Smitzko et al. 2003 108 2041 2048 Sunara et al. 2005 62 2487 2494 neurodegenerative disease Farooqui et al. 2004 11 1961 1977 allergic disease Triggiani et al. 2005 116 1000 1006 . Another example of effector protein changes that may be measured by blood fingerprints is the regulation of map kinase in response to cardiovascular disease or in certain cancers or tumors including prostate cancer Kopper at al. 2005 11 197203 . Changes in signaling proteins serve as biological markers or blood fingerprints that may be used to diagnose or monitor disease.

As one of skill in the art can readily appreciate certain aspects of the present invention refer to known protein and nucleic acid sequences. Wherein such sequences are included in a diagnostic or prognostic panel and have previously been described as indicative of disease or perturbation of that organ the inventive panel should comprise at least one additional organ specific marker nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence or detection reagent thereto . Accordingly wherein a known sequence either nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence is included in a panel or mixture and wherein said sequence has been demonstrated by the art to be previously associated with the particular organ and or indicative of perturbation such sequences should also be associated with at least one sequence not previously specifically associated with the organ and or disease perturbation.

Prior to setting forth the invention in further detail it may be helpful to an understanding thereof to set forth definitions of certain terms that will be used hereinafter.

In the practice of the invention an individual or subject refers to vertebrates particularly members of a mammalian species and includes but is not limited to primates including human and non human primates domestic animals and sports animals.

 Component or member of a set refers to an individual constituent protein peptide nucleotide or polynucleotide of an organ specific set.

As used herein an organ specific protein set is made up of the set of organ specific proteins identified from an organ sample obtained from a normal healthy individual using the methods described herein see e.g. Example 1 and Example 9 . Illustrative organ specific protein sets are provided in Tables 1 32 36 45 and 47 79 and were identified using analysis of MPSS transcripts as described further herein and using sequencing by synthesis SBS analysis as described further herein. Individual proteins that make up the set are referred to herein as components or members of the set. In the examples and recitation below blood is used as the prototypic example however it should be understood that any biological fluid or sample may be exchanged for the terms blood serum or plasma. Accordingly normal organ specific blood fingerprint can be exchanged with organ specific saliva urine tissue etc. fingerprint .

As used herein a normal serum organ specific protein set comprises the subset of proteins from an organ specific protein set that are detected in normal serum. Individual proteins that make up the set are referred to herein as components or members of the set.

As used herein a normal organ specific blood fingerprint is a data set comprising the determined levels in blood from normal healthy individuals of one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty forty one forty two forty three forty four forty five forty six forty seven forty eight forty nine fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety one hundred or more components of a serum organ specific protein set of one organ but could comprise multiples thereof if more than one organ is analyzed. The normal levels in the blood for each component included in a fingerprint are determined by measuring the level of protein in the blood using any of a variety of techniques known in the art and described herein in a sufficient number of blood samples from normal healthy individuals to determine the standard deviation SD with statistically meaningful accuracy. Thus as would be recognized by one of skill in the art a determined normal level is defined by averaging the level of protein measured in a statistically large number of blood samples from normal healthy individuals and thereby defining a statistical range of normal. A normal organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels in normal healthy blood of N members of a serum organ specific protein set wherein N is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 or more members up to the total number of members in a given serum organ specific protein set per organ being profiled. In certain embodiments a normal organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels in normal healthy blood of at least two components of a serum organ specific protein set. In other embodiments a normal organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels in normal healthy blood of at least 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 or 20 components of a serum organ specific protein set. In yet further embodiments a normal organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the presence or absence of organ cell or tissue specific proteins or transcripts and may or may not rely on absolute levels of said components per se. In specific embodiments merely a change over a baseline measurement for a particular individual may be used. In such an embodiment levels or mere presence or absence of proteins or transcripts from blood body fluid or tissue may be measured at one time point and then compared to a subsequent measurement hours days months or years later. Accordingly normal changes per individual can be zeroed out and only those proteins or transcripts that change over time are focused on.

As used herein a predetermined normal level is an average of the levels of a given component measured in a statistically large number of blood samples from normal healthy individuals. Thus a predetermined normal level is a statistical range of normal and is also referred to herein as predetermined normal range . The normal levels or range of levels in the blood for each component are determined by measuring the level of protein in the blood using any of a variety of techniques known in the art and described herein in a sufficient number of blood samples from normal healthy individuals to determine the standard deviation SD with statistically meaningful accuracy. In one embodiment it may be useful to determine average levels for individual falling into different age groups e.g. 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 12 and so forth if indeed these levels change with age . In another embodiment one may also want to determine the levels at certain times of the day at certain times from having eaten a meal etc. One may also determine how common physiological stimuli affect the organ specific blood fingerprints.

As used herein a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint is a data set comprising the determined level in a blood sample from an individual afflicted with a disease of one or more components of a normal serum organ specific protein set that demonstrates a statistically significant change as compared to the determined normal level e.g. wherein the level in the disease sample is above or below a predetermined normal range . The data set is compiled from samples from individuals who are determined to have a particular disease using established medical diagnostics for the particular disease. The blood serum level of each protein member of a normal serum organ specific protein set as measured in the blood of the diseased sample is compared to the corresponding determined normal level. A statistically significant variation from the determined normal level for one or more members of the normal serum organ specific protein set provides diagnostically useful information disease associated fingerprint for that disease. Thus note that it may be determined for a particular disease or disease state that the level of only a few members of the normal serum organ specific protein set change relative to the normal levels. Thus a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint may comprise the determined levels in the blood of only a subset of the components of a normal serum organ specific protein set for a given organ and a particular disease. Thus a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels in blood or as noted herein any bodily fluid or tissue sample however in most embodiments samples from blood are compared with a normal from blood and so on of N members of a serum organ specific protein set wherein N is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or more or any integer value therebetween or more members up to the total number of members in a given serum organ specific protein set. In this regard in certain embodiments a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels of one or more components of a normal serum organ specific protein set. In one embodiment a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels of at least two components of a normal serum organ specific protein set. In other embodiments a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels of at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or more or any integer value therebetween components of a normal serum organ specific protein set.

The term test compound refers in general to a compound to which a test cell is exposed about which one desires to collect data. Typical test compounds will be small organic molecules typically prospective pharmaceutical lead compounds but can include proteins e.g. antibodies peptides polynucleotides heterologous genes in expression systems plasmids polynucleotide analogs peptide analogs lipids carbohydrates viruses phage parasites and the like.

The term biological activity as used herein refers to the ability of a test compound to alter the expression of one or more genes or proteins.

The term test cell refers to a biological system or a model of a biological system capable of reacting to the presence of a test compound typically a eukaryotic cell or tissue sample or a prokaryotic organism.

The term gene expression profile refers to a representation of the expression level of a plurality of genes in response to a selected expression condition for example incubation in the presence of a standard compound or test compound . Gene expression profiles can be expressed in terms of an absolute quantity of mRNA transcribed for each gene as a ratio of mRNA transcribed in a test cell as compared with a control cell and the like or the mere presence or absence of a protein an RNA transcript or more generally gene expression. As used herein a standard gene expression profile refers to a profile already present in the primary database for example a profile obtained by incubation of a test cell with a standard compound such as a drug of known activity while a test gene expression profile refers to a profile generated under the conditions being investigated. The term modulated refers to an alteration in the expression level induction or repression to a measurable or detectable degree as compared to a pre established standard for example the expression level of a selected tissue or cell type at a selected phase under selected conditions .

 Similar as used herein refers to a degree of difference between two quantities that is within a preselected threshold. The similarity of two profiles can be defined in a number of different ways for example in terms of the number of identical genes affected the degree to which each gene is affected and the like. Several different measures of similarity or methods of scoring similarity can be made available to the user for example one measure of similarity considers each gene that is induced or repressed past a threshold level and increases the score for each gene in which both profiles indicate induction or repression of that gene.

As used herein the term target specific is intended to mean an agent that binds to a target analyte selectively. This agent will bind with preferential affinity toward the target while showing little to no detectable cross reactivity toward other molecules. For example when the target is a nucleic acid a target specific sequence is one that is complementary to the sequence of the target and able to hybridize to the target sequence with little to no detectable cross reactivity with other nucleic acid molecules. A nucleic acid target could also be bound in a target specific manner by a protein for example by the DNA binding domain of a transcription factor. If the target is a protein or peptide it can be bound specifically by a nucleic acid aptamer or another protein or peptide or by an antibody or antibody fragment which are sub classes of proteins.

As used herein the term genedigit is intended to mean a region of pre determined nucleotide or amino acid sequence that serves as an attachment point for a label. The genedigit can have any structure including for example a single unique sequence or a sequence containing repeated core elements. Each genedigit has a unique sequence which differentiates it from other genedigits. An anti genedigit is a nucleotide or amino acid sequence or structure that binds specifically to the gene digit. For example if the genedigit is a nucleic acid the anti genedigit can be a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to the genedigit sequence. If the genedigit is a nucleic acid that contains repeated core elements then the anti genedigit can be a series of repeat sequences that are complementary to the repeat sequences in the genedigit. An anti genedigit can contain the same number or a lesser number of repeat sequences compared to the genedigit as long as the anti genedigit is able to specifically bind to the genedigit.

As used herein the term specifier is intended to mean the linkage of one or more genedigits to a target specific sequence. The genedigits can be directly linked or can be attached using an intervening or adapting sequence. A specifier can contain a target specific sequence which will allow it to bind to a target analyate. An anti specifier has a complementary sequence to all or part of the specifier such that it specifically binds to the specifier.

As used herein the term label is intended to mean a molecule or molecules that render an analyte detectable by an analytical method. An appropriate label depends on the particular assay format and are well known by those skilled in the art. For example a label specific for a nucleic acid molecule can be a complementary nucleic acid molecule attached to a label monomer or measurable moiety such as a radioisotope fluorochrome dye enzyme nanoparticle chemiluminescent marker biotin or other moiety known in the art that is measurable by analytical methods. In addition a label can include any combination of label monomers.

As used herein unique when used in reference to label is intended to mean a label that has a detectable signal that distinguishes it from other labels in the same mixture. Therefore a unique label is a relative term since it is dependent upon the other labels that are present in the mixture and the sensitivity of the detection equipment that is used. In the case of a fluorescent label a unique label is a label that has spectral properties that significantly differentiate it from other fluorescent labels in the same mixture. For example a fluorescein label can be a unique label if it is included in a mixture that contains a rhodamine label since these fluorescent labels emit light at distinct essentially non overlapping wavelengths. However if another fluorescent label was added to the mixture that emitted light at the same or very similar wavelength to fluorescein for example the Oregon Green fluorophore then the fluorescein would no longer be a unique label since Oregon Green and fluorescein could not be distinguished from each other. A unique label is also relative to the sensitivity of the detection equipment used. For example a FACS machine can be used to detect the emission peaks from different fluorophore containing labels. If a particular set of labels have emission peaks that are separated by for example 2 nm these labels would not be unique if detected on a FACS machine that can distinguish peaks that are separated by 10 nm or greater but these labels would be unique if detected on a FACS machine that can distinguish peaks separated by 1 nm or greater.

As used herein the term signal is intended to mean a detectable physical quantity or impulse by which information on the presence of an analyte can be determined. Therefore a signal is the read out or measurable component of detection. A signal includes for example fluorescence luminescence calorimetric density image sound voltage current magnetic field and mass. Therefore the term unit signal as used herein is intended to mean a specified quantity of a signal in terms of which the magnitudes of other quantities of signals of the same kind can be stated. Detection equipment can count signals of the same type and display the amount of signal in terms of a common unit. For example a nucleic acid can be radioactively labeled at one nucleotide position and another nucleic acid can be radioactively labeled at three nucleotide positions. The radioactive particles emitted by each nucleic acid can be detected and quantified for example in a scintillation counter and displayed as the number of counts per minute cpm . The nucleic acid labeled at three positions will emit about three times the number of radioactive particles as the nucleic acid labeled at one position and hence about three times the number of cpms will be recorded.

Because the disease perturbed networks in the organ may initiate the expression of one or more proteins whose synthesis it does not ordinarily control it should be noted that in certain embodiments a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint will comprise the determined level of one or more components of a normal organ specific protein set that are NOT components of the corresponding normal serum organ specific protein set. Thus in this regard a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint may comprise the determined level of one or more components of a normal organ specific protein set or may comprise a protein or set of proteins not detected in a normal organ specific protein set. Further in certain embodiments a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels of one or more components of one two three four five six seven eight nine ten 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween or more normal serum organ specific protein sets. Further in additional embodiments the at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or more or any integer value therebetween components of multiple sets could be combined for analysis of multiple organs tissues systems or cells. Thus in this regard a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint may comprise the determined levels of one or more components from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween components or more normal serum organ specific protein sets.

The term polynucleotide refers to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length including deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides which can comprise analogs thereof.

As used herein purified refers to a specific protein polypeptide or peptide composition that has been subjected to fractionation to remove various other proteins polypeptides or peptides and which composition substantially retains its activity as may be assessed for example by any of a variety of protein assays known to the skilled artisan for the specific or desired protein polypeptide or peptide.

The terms polypeptide peptide and protein are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified for example by disulfide bond formation glycosylation lipidation or conjugation with a labeling component.

The terms glycopeptide or glycoprotein refers to a peptide that contains covalently bound carbohydrate. The carbohydrate can be a monosaccharide oligosaccharide or polysaccharide.

The invention provides organ specific protein sets. An organ specific protein set is made up of the set of organ specific proteins as defined further herein identified from a normal healthy sample of a particular organ using the methods described herein see e.g. Example 1 and Example 9 . Illustrative organ specific protein sets include those provided in Tables 1 32 36 45 and 47 79. Amino acid and polynucleotide sequences for illustrative organ specific proteins are set forth in SEQ ID NOs 1 72 689.

As used herein the term organ is defined as would be understood in the art. Thus the term organ specific as used herein generally refers to proteins or transcripts that are primarily expressed in a single organ. In addition in a complex organ such as the brain there will be distinct functional subregions e.g. the cortex the cerebellum the thalamus etc that will be equivalent to different organs as defined above. It should be noted that the skilled artisan would readily appreciate upon reading the instant specification that cell specific transcripts and proteins and tissue specific transcripts and proteins are also contemplated in the present invention. Further as those of skill in the art would appreciate the transcriptomes e.g. quantitative collection of the full complement of mRNAs or transcripts in a particular tissue or organ at a particular time of organs that are specific for males or females should not be included when assessing organ specific transcripts or proteins of the opposite sex in this regard exemplary tables and analysis are set forth in Tables 36 42 44 45 72 77 and 79 . As such and as discussed further herein in certain embodiments organ specific protein is defined as a protein encoded by a transcript that is expressed at a level of at least 3 copies million as measured for example by massively parallel signature sequencing MPSS or sequencing by synthesis SBS in the cell tissue organ of interest but is expressed at less than 3 copies million in other cells tissues organs. In a further embodiment an organ specific protein is one that is encoded by a transcript that is expressed 95 in one organ and the remaining 5 in one or more other organs. In this context total expression across all organs examined is taken as 100 . In certain embodiments an organ specific protein is one that is encoded by a transcript that is expressed at about 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 to about 90 in one organ and wherein the remaining 10 50 is expressed in one or more other organs.

Assume the expression in tpm and the associated SD of a MPSS sequence tag in a tissue is X where i 1 2 . . . 32 represents individual tissues. Assume the tag has the highest expression levels in tissue m where the expression and the SD are X . Three rules are then applied to determine whether the tag is specific to tissue m as follows 

The significance that the expression of the tag in tissue m is above the expression of the tag in other tissues is then evaluated as

In this embodiment nine different values of fand pcan be applied in determining organ specific MPSS tags ranging from the most stringent condition f 1 and p 10 to the least stringent condition f 0.5 and p 0.1 . In one particular embodiment it is required that p 10. 10 

As would be readily recognized by the skilled artisan upon reading the present disclosure in certain embodiments an organ specific blood fingerprint can readily be discerned even if some expression of an organ specific protein from a particular organ is detected at some level in another organ or even more than one organ. For example the organ specific blood fingerprint from prostate can conclusively identify a particular prostate disease and stage of disease despite expression of one or more protein members of the fingerprint in one or more other organs. Thus an organ specific protein as described herein may be predominantly or differentially expressed in an organ of interest rather than uniquely or specifically expressed in the organ. In this regard in certain embodiments differentially expressed means at least 1.5 fold expression in the organ of interest as compared to other organs. In another embodiment differentially expressed means at least 2 fold expression in the organ of interest as compared to expression in other organs. In yet a further embodiment differentially expressed means at least 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 fold or higher expression in the organ of interest as compared to expression of the protein in other organs. As described elsewhere herein protein expression can be determined by analysis of transcript expression using a variety of methods.

In one embodiment the organ specific proteins are identified by preparing RNA and or a cDNA library from an organ tissue or biological fluid e.g. whole blood serum etc. of interest. Any organ of a mammalian body is contemplated herein. Illustrative organs include but are not limited to heart kidney ureter bladder urethra liver prostate heart blood vessels bone marrow skeletal muscle smooth muscle brain amygdala caudate nucleus cerebellum corpus callosum fetal hypothalamus thalamus spinal cord peripheral nerves retina nose trachea lungs mouth salivary gland esophagus stomach small intestines large intestines hypothalamus pituitary thyroid pancreas adrenal glands ovaries oviducts uterus placenta vagina mammary glands testes seminal vesicles penis lymph nodes PBMC thymus and spleen. As noted above upon reading the present disclosure the skilled artisan would recognize that cell specific and tissue specific proteins are contemplated herein and thus proteins specifically expressed in cells or tissues that make up such organs are also contemplated herein. In certain embodiments in each of these organs transcriptomes are obtained for the cell types in which the disease of interest arises. For example in the prostate there are two dominant types of cells epithelial cells and stromal cells. About 98 of prostate cancers arise in epithelial cells. Similarly in the breast 90 of cancers arise in epithelial cells. As such in certain embodiments transcriptomes are isolated from these particular cell types from an organ of interest e.g. prostate epithelial cells breast epithelial cells . In this regard any cell type that makes up any of the organs described herein is contemplated herein. Illustrative cell types include but are not limited to epithelial cells stromal cells cortical cells endothelial cells endodermal cells ectodermal cells mesodermal cells lymphocytes e.g. B cells and T cells including CD4 T helper 1 or T helper 2 type cells CD8 cytotoxic T cells all of the major types of white blood cells present in the blood e.g. eosinophils megakaryocytes granulocytes macrophages neutrophils etc erythrocytes keratinocytes and fibroblasts. In the case of the white blood cells the organ specific proteins can be obtain directly from the isolated cell types and will not have to be secreted into the blood for identification. Thus the organ specific strategy will allow us to assess any diseases of the white blood cell types e.g. neutrophils basophils eosinophils macrophage monocytes and lymphocytes including B and T lymphocytes . Particular cell types within organs or tissues may be obtained by histological dissection by the use of specific cell lines e.g. prostate epithelial cell lines by cell sorting or by a variety of other techniques known in the art. Not only are the above parameters useful in identifying organ specific proteins or transcripts but such analysis can be used in harvesting mRNA and cDNA from a fluid tissue organ of interest or blood for analysis.

In one embodiment transcriptomes from a particular cell type of an organ of interest such as prostate epithelial cells breast epithelial cells etc. are isolated and analyzed using methods as described herein to determine which transcripts are organ specific. The organ specific transcripts identified from the particular cell type of the organ can then be compared to the organ specific transcripts identified from whole organ samples e.g. the organ specific proteins provided in Tables 1 32 36 45 and 47 79 to determine those transcripts that overlap or to identify additional organ specific transcripts that may not have been detected from the whole tissue due to sensitivity issues. In this way additional normal organ specific protein members of a set can be identified. Further in certain embodiments a subset of normal organ specific proteins can also be identified. For example a normal prostate epithelial cell specific protein subset can be identified that is the set of proteins that are specifically expressed in prostate epithelial cells. Thus particular cell types from organs may include but are not limited to renal cortical epithelial cells hepatocytes mammary epithelial cells prostate epithelial cells renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and epidermal keratinocytes. This list is only exemplary and not meant to be limiting.

As one of skill in the art can appreciate technology in the area of detection techniques is rapidly evolving. In particular techniques that only a few years ago required milligram quantities of sample can now be performed with pictogram quantities. Nanotechnology techniques can now be employed to assist in detection of nucleic acid and polypeptide targets of the present invention. Further as this technology develops it will be feasible to achieve single cell specific transcripts. These single cell techniques are now available for abundant transcripts and can be adapted by the skilled artisan to permit the analyses of low abundance transcripts at the single cell level.

It should be noted that in certain embodiments organ specific blood fingerprints can be determined from organ specific proteins from multiple organs such as from organs that share a common function or make up a system e.g. digestive system circulatory system respiratory system cardiovascular system the immune system including the different cells of the immune system such as but not limited to B cells T cells including CD4 T helper 1 or T helper 2 type cells regulatory T cells CD8 cytotoxic T cells NK cells dendritic cells macrophages monocytes neutrophils granulocytes mast cells etc. the sensory system the skin brain and the nervous system and the like . Accordingly panels of probes to the organ specific components described herein can be fashioned in a way to analyze multiple organ combinations.

As noted above in addition to detection of polypeptides that are organ tissue specific either in blood tissue sample or biological fluid nucleic acid detection techniques offer additional advantages due to sensitivity of detection. RNA can be collected and or generated from blood biological fluids tissues organs cell lines or other relevant sample using techniques known in the art such as those described in Kingston. 2002 Greene Publ. Assoc. Inc. John Wiley Sons Inc. NY N.Y. see e.g. as described by Nelson et al. 99 11890 11895 2002 and elsewhere. Further a variety of commercially available kits for constructing RNA are useful for making the RNA to be used in the present invention. RNA is constructed from organs tissues cells procured from normal healthy subjects however this invention contemplates construction of RNA from diseased subjects. This invention contemplates using any type of organ from any type of subject or animal. For test samples RNA may be procured from an individual e.g. any animal including mammals with or without visible disease and from tissue samples biological fluids e.g. whole blood or the like. In some embodiments amplification or construction of cDNA sequences may be helpful to increase detection capabilities. The present invention as well as the art provides the requisite level of detail to perform such tasks. In one aspect of the present invention whole blood is used as the source of RNA and accordingly RNA stabilizing regents are optionally used such as PAX tubes as described in Thach et al. . December 283 1 2 269 279 2003 and Chai et al. 19 5 182 188 2005 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety .

Complementary DNA cDNA libraries can be generated using techniques known in the art such as those described in Ausubel et al. 2001 Greene Publ. Assoc. Inc. John Wiley Sons Inc. NY N.Y. Sambrook et al. 1989 Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Plainview N.Y. Maniatis et al. 1982 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Plainview N.Y. and elsewhere. Further a variety of commercially available kits for constructing cDNA libraries are useful for making the cDNA libraries of the present invention. Libraries are constructed from organs tissues cells procured from normal healthy subjects.

By amplification or nucleic acid amplification is meant production of multiple copies of a target nucleic acid that contains at least a portion of the intended specific target nucleic acid sequence. The multiple copies may be referred to as amplicons or amplification products. In certain embodiments the amplified target contains less than the complete target gene sequence introns and exons or an expressed target gene sequence spliced transcript of exons and flanking untranslated sequences . For example specific amplicons may be produced by amplifying a portion of the target polynucleotide by using amplification primers that hybridize to and initiate polymerization from internal positions of the target polynucleotide. Preferably the amplified portion contains a detectable target sequence that may be detected using any of a variety of well known methods.

Many well known methods of nucleic acid amplification require thermocycling to alternately denature double stranded nucleic acids and hybridize primers however other well known methods of nucleic acid amplification are isothermal. The polymerase chain reaction U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 683 195 4 683 202 4 800 159 4 965 188 commonly referred to as PCR uses multiple cycles of denaturation annealing of primer pairs to opposite strands and primer extension to exponentially increase copy numbers of the target sequence. In a variation called RT PCR reverse transcriptase RT is used to make a complementary DNA cDNA from mRNA and the cDNA is then amplified by PCR to produce multiple copies of DNA. The ligase chain reaction Weiss R. 1991 Science 254 1292 commonly referred to as LCR uses two sets of complementary DNA oligonucleotides that hybridize to adjacent regions of the target nucleic acid. The DNA oligonucleotides are covalently linked by a DNA ligase in repeated cycles of thermal denaturation hybridization and ligation to produce a detectable double stranded ligated oligonucleotide product. Another method is strand displacement amplification Walker G. et al. 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 392 396 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 270 184 and 5 455 166 commonly referred to as SDA which uses cycles of annealing pairs of primer sequences to opposite strands of a target sequence primer extension in the presence of a dNTP S to produce a duplex hemiphosphorothioated primer extension product endonuclease mediated nicking of a hemimodified restriction endonuclease recognition site and polymerase mediated primer extension from the 3 end of the nick to displace an existing strand and produce a strand for the next round of primer annealing nicking and strand displacement resulting in geometric amplification of product. Thermophilic SDA tSDA uses thermophilic endonucleases and polymerases at higher temperatures in essentially the same method European Pat. No. 0 684 315 . Other amplification methods include nucleic acid sequence based amplification U.S. Pat. No. 5 130 238 commonly referred to as NASBA one that uses an RNA replicase to amplify the probe molecule itself Lizardi P. et al. 1988 BioTechnol. 6 1197 1202 commonly referred to as Q replicase a transcription based amplification method Kwoh D. et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 1173 1177 self sustained sequence replication Guatelli J. et al. 1990 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 1874 1878 and transcription mediated amplification U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 480 784 and 5 399 491 commonly referred to as TMA. For further discussion of known amplification methods see Persing David H. 1993 In Vitro Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques in Diagnostic Medical Microbiology Principles and Applications Persing et al. Eds. pp. 51 87 American Society for Microbiology Washington D.C. .

Illustrative transcription based amplification systems of the present invention include TMA which employs an RNA polymerase to produce multiple RNA transcripts of a target region U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 480 784 and 5 399 491 . TMA uses a promoter primer that hybridizes to a target nucleic acid in the presence of a reverse transcriptase and an RNA polymerase to form a double stranded promoter from which the RNA polymerase produces RNA transcripts. These transcripts can become templates for further rounds of TMA in the presence of a second primer capable of hybridizing to the RNA transcripts. Unlike PCR LCR or other methods that require heat denaturation TMA is an isothermal method that uses an RNase H activity to digest the RNA strand of an RNA DNA hybrid thereby making the DNA strand available for hybridization with a primer or promoter primer. Generally the RNase H activity associated with the reverse transcriptase provided for amplification is used.

In an illustrative TMA method one amplification primer is an oligonucleotide promoter primer that comprises a promoter sequence which becomes functional when double stranded located 5 of a target binding sequence which is capable of hybridizing to a binding site of a target RNA at a location 3 to the sequence to be amplified. A promoter primer may be referred to as a T7 primer when it is specific for T7 RNA polymerase recognition. Under certain circumstances the 3 end of a promoter primer or a subpopulation of such promoter primers may be modified to block or reduce primer extension. From an unmodified promoter primer reverse transcriptase creates a cDNA copy of the target RNA while RNase H activity degrades the target RNA. A second amplification primer then binds to the cDNA. This primer may be referred to as a non T7 primer to distinguish it from a T7 primer . From this second amplification primer reverse transcriptase creates another DNA strand resulting in a double stranded DNA with a functional promoter at one end. When double stranded the promoter sequence is capable of binding an RNA polymerase to begin transcription of the target sequence to which the promoter primer is hybridized. An RNA polymerase uses this promoter sequence to produce multiple RNA transcripts i.e. amplicons generally about 100 to 1 000 copies. Each newly synthesized amplicon can anneal with the second amplification primer. Reverse transcriptase can then create a DNA copy while the RNase H activity degrades the RNA of this RNA DNA duplex. The promoter primer can then bind to the newly synthesized DNA allowing the reverse transcriptase to create a double stranded DNA from which the RNA polymerase produces multiple amplicons. Thus a billion fold isothermic amplification can be achieved using two amplification primers.

 Selective amplification as used herein refers to the amplification of a target nucleic acid sequence according to the present invention wherein detectable amplification of the target sequence is substantially limited to amplification of target sequence contributed by a nucleic acid sample of interest that is being tested and is not contributed by target nucleic acid sequence contributed by some other sample source e.g. contamination present in reagents used during amplification reactions or in the environment in which amplification reactions are performed.

By amplification conditions is meant conditions permitting nucleic acid amplification according to the present invention. Amplification conditions may in some embodiments be less stringent than stringent hybridization conditions as described herein. Oligonucleotides used in the amplification reactions of the present invention hybridize to their intended targets under amplification conditions but may or may not hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions. On the other hand detection probes of the present invention hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions. While the Examples section infra provides preferred amplification conditions for amplifying target nucleic acid sequences according to the present invention other acceptable conditions to carry out nucleic acid amplifications according to the present invention could be easily ascertained by someone having ordinary skill in the art depending on the particular method of amplification employed.

As used herein the term oligonucleotide or oligo or oligomer is intended to encompass a singular oligonucleotide as well as plural oligonucleotides and refers to any polymer of two or more of nucleotides nucleosides nucleobases or related compounds used as a reagent in the amplification methods of the present invention as well as subsequent detection methods. The oligonucleotide may be DNA and or RNA and or analogs thereof. The term oligonucleotide does not denote any particular function to the reagent rather it is used generically to cover all such reagents described herein. An oligonucleotide may serve various different functions e.g. it may function as a primer if it is capable of hybridizing to a complementary strand and can further be extended in the presence of a nucleic acid polymerase it may provide a promoter if it contains a sequence recognized by an RNA polymerase and allows for transcription and it may function to prevent hybridization or impede primer extension if appropriately situated and or modified. Specific oligonucleotides of the present invention are described in more detail below but are directed to binding the organ specific transcript or the organ specific transcript encoding the sequences listed in the attached Tables 1 32 36 45 and 47 79 or the appended sequence listing. As used herein an oligonucleotide can be virtually any length limited only by its specific function in the amplification reaction or in detecting an amplification product of the amplification reaction.

Oligonucleotides of a defined sequence and chemical structure may be produced by techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as by chemical or biochemical synthesis and by in vitro or in vivo expression from recombinant nucleic acid molecules e.g. bacterial or viral vectors. As intended by this disclosure an oligonucleotide does not consist solely of wild type chromosomal DNA or the in vivo transcription products thereof.

Oligonucleotides may be modified in any way as long as a given modification is compatible with the desired function of a given oligonucleotide. One of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine whether a given modification is suitable or desired for any given oligonucleotide of the present invention. Modifications include base modifications sugar modifications or backbone modifications. Base modifications include but are not limited to the use of the following bases in addition to adenine cytidine guanosine thymine and uracil C 5 propyne 2 amino adenine 5 methyl cytidine inosine and dP and dK bases. The sugar groups of the nucleoside subunits may be ribose deoxyribose and analogs thereof including for example ribonucleosides having a 2 O methyl substitution to the ribofuranosyl moiety. See Becker et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 130 038. Other sugar modifications include but are not limited to 2 amino 2 fluoro L alpha threofuranosyl and pentopuranosyl modifications. The nucleoside subunits may by joined by linkages such as phosphodiester linkages modified linkages or by non nucleotide moieties which do not prevent hybridization of the oligonucleotide to its complementary target nucleic acid sequence. Modified linkages include those linkages in which a standard phosphodiester linkage is replaced with a different linkage such as a phosphorothioate linkage or a methylphosphonate linkage. The nucleobase subunits may be joined for example by replacing the natural deoxyribose phosphate backbone of DNA with a pseudo peptide backbone such as a 2 aminoethylglycine backbone which couples the nucleobase subunits by means of a carboxymethyl linker to the central secondary amine. DNA analogs having a pseudo peptide backbone are commonly referred to as peptide nucleic acids or PNA and are disclosed by Nielsen et al. Peptide Nucleic Acids U.S. Pat. No. 5 539 082. Other linkage modifications include but are not limited to morpholino bonds.

Non limiting examples of oligonucleotides or oligomers contemplated by the present invention include nucleic acid analogs containing bicyclic and tricyclic nucleoside and nucleotide analogs LNAs . See Imanishi et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 268 490 and Wengel et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 670 461. Any nucleic acid analog is contemplated by the present invention provided the modified oligonucleotide can perform its intended function e.g. hybridize to a target nucleic acid under stringent hybridization conditions or amplification conditions or interact with a DNA or RNA polymerase thereby initiating extension or transcription. In the case of detection probes the modified oligonucleotides must also be capable of preferentially hybridizing to the target nucleic acid under stringent hybridization conditions.

While design and sequence of oligonucleotides for the present invention depend on their function as described below several variables must generally be taken into account. Among the most critical are length melting temperature Tm specificity complementarity with other oligonucleotides in the system G C content polypyrimidine T C or polypurine A G stretches and the 3 end sequence. Controlling for these and other variables is a standard and well known aspect of oligonucleotide design and various computer programs are readily available to screen large numbers of potential oligonucleotides for optimal ones.

The 3 terminus of an oligonucleotide or other nucleic acid can be blocked in a variety of ways using a blocking moiety as described below. A blocked oligonucleotide is not efficiently extended by the addition of nucleotides to its 3 terminus by a DNA or RNA dependent DNA polymerase to produce a complementary strand of DNA. As such a blocked oligonucleotide cannot be a primer. 

As used in this disclosure the phrase an oligonucleotide having a nucleic acid sequence comprising consisting of or consisting essentially of a sequence selected from a group of specific sequences means that the oligonucleotide as a basic and novel characteristic is capable of stably hybridizing to a nucleic acid having the exact complement of one of the listed nucleic acid sequences of the group under stringent hybridization conditions. An exact complement includes the corresponding DNA or RNA sequence.

The phrase an oligonucleotide substantially corresponding to a nucleic acid sequence means that the referred to oligonucleotide is sufficiently similar to the reference nucleic acid sequence such that the oligonucleotide has similar hybridization properties to the reference nucleic acid sequence in that it would hybridize with the same target nucleic acid sequence under stringent hybridization conditions.

One skilled in the art will understand that substantially corresponding oligonucleotides of the invention can vary from the referred to sequence and still hybridize to the same target nucleic acid sequence. This variation from the nucleic acid may be stated in terms of a percentage of identical bases within the sequence or the percentage of perfectly complementary bases between the probe or primer and its target sequence. Thus an oligonucleotide of the present invention substantially corresponds to a reference nucleic acid sequence if these percentages of base identity or complementarity are from 100 to about 80 . In preferred embodiments the percentage is from 100 to about 85 . In more preferred embodiments this percentage can be from 100 to about 90 in other preferred embodiments this percentage is from 100 to about 95 . One skilled in the art will understand the various modifications to the hybridization conditions that might be required at various percentages of complementarity to allow hybridization to a specific target sequence without causing an unacceptable level of non specific hybridization.

The skilled artisan will recognize that any of a wide variety of known and available amplification techniques may be employed in the methods of the present invention even if not explicitly described herein. Illustrative non limiting examples of such amplification techniques are described below.

One illustrative amplification technique useful in accordance with the methods herein is the polymerase chain reaction. As noted above the polymerase chain reaction U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 683 195 4 683 202 4 800 159 4 965 188 commonly referred to as PCR uses multiple cycles of denaturation annealing of primer pairs to opposite strands and primer extension to exponentially increase copy numbers of the target sequence. In a variation called RT PCR reverse transcriptase RT is used to make a complementary DNA cDNA from mRNA and the cDNA is then amplified by PCR to produce multiple copies of DNA.

Another illustrative amplification method the ligase chain reaction Weiss R. 1991 Science 254 1292 commonly referred to as LCR uses two sets of complementary DNA oligonucleotides that hybridize to adjacent regions of the target nucleic acid. The DNA oligonucleotides are covalently linked by a DNA ligase in repeated cycles of thermal denaturation hybridization and ligation to produce a detectable double stranded ligated oligonucleotide product.

Another illustrative method is strand displacement amplification Walker G. et al. 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 392 396 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 270 184 and 5 455 166 commonly referred to as SDA which uses cycles of annealing pairs of primer sequences to opposite strands of a target sequence primer extension in the presence of a dNTP S to produce a duplex hemiphosphorothioated primer extension product endonuclease mediated nicking of a hemimodified restriction endonuclease recognition site and polymerase mediated primer extension from the 3 end of the nick to displace an existing strand and produce a strand for the next round of primer annealing nicking and strand displacement resulting in geometric amplification of product. Thermophilic SDA tSDA uses thermophilic endonucleases and polymerases at higher temperatures in essentially the same method European Pat. No. 0 684 315 .

Other amplification methods include for example nucleic acid sequence based amplification U.S. Pat.

In more particular embodiments the amplification technique used in the methods of the present invention is a transcription based amplification technique such as TMA and NASBA.

All or substantially all of the unique transcripts of RNA or from a cDNA library e.g. representing virtually or substantially all genes functioning in the organ of interest can be identified and quantified using any of a variety of techniques known in the art. In this regard in certain embodiments substantially all refers to a sample representing at least 80 of all genes detectably expressed in the organ of interest. In a further embodiment substantially all refers to a sample representing at least 65 70 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 99 or higher of all genes functioning in the organ of interest. In one embodiment substantially all the transcripts from a cDNA library are amplified sorted and signature sequences generated therefrom according to the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 013 445 6 172 218 6 172 214 6 140 489 and Brenner P. et al. 18 630 634 2000. Briefly polynucleotide templates from a cDNA library of interest are cloned into a vector system that contains a vast set of minimally cross hybridizing oligonucleotide tags see U.S. Pat. No. 5 863 722 . The number of tags is usually at least 100 times greater than the number of cDNA templates see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 013 445 and Brenner P. et al. supra . Thus the set of tags is such that a 1 sample taken of template tag conjugates ensures that essentially every template in the sample is conjugated to a unique tag and that at least one of each of the different template cDNAs is represented in the sample with 99 probability U.S. Pat. No. 6 013 445 and Brenner P. et al. supra . The conjugates are then amplified and hybridized under stringent conditions to microbeads each of which has attached thereto a unique complementary minimally cross hybridizing oligonucleotide tag. The transcripts are then directly sequenced simultaneously in a flow cell using a ligation based sequencing method see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 013 445 . A short signature sequence of about 16 20 base pairs Brenner P. et al. supra is generated simultaneously from each of the hundreds of thousands of beads or more in the flow cell each having attached thereto copies of a unique transcript from the sample. This technique is termed massively parallel signature sequencing MPSS .

The resulting sequences e.g. MPSS signature sequences are generally about 17 20 bases in length. However in certain embodiments the sequences can be about 8 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 100 or more bases in length. The sequences are annotated using annotated human genome sequence such as human genome release hg16 released in November 2003 or other public or private databases and the human Unigene Unigene build 184 using methods known in the art such as the method described by Meyers B. C. et al. Genome Res 14 1641 1653 2004. Other databases useful in this regard include Genbank EMBL or other publicly available databases. In certain embodiments transcripts are considered only for those with 100 matches between an MPSS or other type of signature and a genome signature. As would be readily appreciated by the skilled artisan upon reading the present disclosure this is a stringent match criterion and in certain embodiments it may be desirable to use less stringent match criteria. Indeed polymorphisms could lead to variations in transcripts that would be missed if only exact matches were used. For example it may be desirable to consider signature sequences that match a genome signature with 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identity. In one embodiment signatures that are expressed at less than 3 transcripts per million in libraries of interest are disregarded as they might not be reliably detected since this in effect represents less than one transcript per cell see for example Jongeneel C. V. et al. 2003 . Alternatively transcripts at this level may arise from cells that are present as only a fraction of the population e.g. 1 hence the measurement could be real. cDNA signatures are classified by their positions relative to polyadenylation signals and poly A tails and by their orientation relative to the 5 3 orientation of source mRNA. Full length sequences corresponding to the signature sequences can be thus identified.

In one embodiment substantially all the transcripts from a cDNA library are identified using sequencing by synthesis SBS or similar technology such as that developed by Solexa now part of Illumina San Diego Calif. . This technology may be used to identify signature sequences of the transcriptome of a particular organ tissue cell of interest. See for example the methods described in Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2007 January 7 1 65 76 Rosenthal A Brenner S. 1994 2000. U.S. Pat. No. 6 087 095 DNA sequencing method Ronaghi M.

In certain embodiments other techniques may be used to evaluate RNA transcripts of the transcripts from a particular cDNA library including microarray analysis Han M. et al. 19 631 635 2001 Bao P. et al. 74 1792 1797 2002 Schena et al. 93 10614 19 1996 and Heller et al. 94 2150 55 1997 and SAGE serial analysis of gene expression . Like MPSS SAGE is digital and can generate a large number of signature sequences. see e.g. Velculescu V. E. et al. 16 423 425. 2000 Tuteja R. and Tuteja N. 2004 August 26 8 916 22 although orders of magnitude fewer than that are available from techniques such as MPSS.

Additionally the present invention may have preferred embodiments that include methods for providing genetic information over networks such as the Internet as shown in U.S. Ser. Nos. 10 197 621 10 063 559 United States Publication Number 20020183936 10 065 856 10 065 868 10 328 818 10 328 872 10 423 403 and 60 482 389.

The term array as used herein refers to an intentionally created collection of molecules that can be prepared either synthetically or biosynthetically. The molecules in the array can be identical or different from each other. The array can assume a variety of formats for example libraries of soluble molecules libraries of compounds tethered to resin beads silica chips or other solid supports.

The term mRNA or sometimes refer by mRNAtranscripts as used herein include but not limited to pre mRNA transcript s transcript processing intermediates mature mRNA s ready for translation and transcripts of the gene or genes or nucleic acids derived from the mRNA transcript s . Transcript processing may include splicing editing and degradation. As used herein a nucleic acid derived from an mRNA transcript refers to a nucleic acid for whose synthesis the mRNA transcript or a subsequence thereof has ultimately served as a template. Thus a cDNA reverse transcribed from an mRNA an RNA transcribed from that cDNA a DNA amplified from the cDNA an RNA transcribed from the amplified DNA etc. are all derived from the mRNA transcript and detection of such derived products is indicative of the presence and or abundance of the original transcript in a sample. Thus mRNA derived samples include but are not limited to mRNA transcripts of the gene or genes cDNA reverse transcribed from the mRNA cRNA transcribed from the cDNA DNA amplified from the genes RNA transcribed from amplified DNA and the like.

The term nucleic acid library or sometimes refer by array as used herein refers to an intentionally created collection of nucleic acids which can be prepared either synthetically or biosynthetically and screened for biological activity in a variety of different formats for example libraries of soluble molecules and libraries of oligos tethered to resin beads silica chips or other solid supports . Additionally the term array is meant to include those libraries of nucleic acids which can be prepared by spotting nucleic acids of essentially any length for example from 1 to about 1000 nucleotide monomers in length onto a substrate. The term nucleic acid as used herein refers to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length either ribonucleotides deoxyribonucleotides or peptide nucleic acids PNAs that comprise purine and pyrimidine bases or other natural chemically or biochemically modified non natural or derivatized nucleotide bases. The backbone of the polynucleotide can comprise sugars and phosphate groups as may typically be found in RNA or DNA or modified or substituted sugar or phosphate groups. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides such as methylated nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non nucleotide components. Thus the terms nucleoside nucleotide deoxynucleoside and deoxynucleotide generally include analogs such as those described herein. These analogs are those molecules having some structural features in common with a naturally occurring nucleoside or nucleotide such that when incorporated into a nucleic acid or oligonucleoside sequence they allow hybridization with a naturally occurring nucleic acid sequence in solution. Typically these analogs are derived from naturally occurring nucleosides and nucleotides by replacing and or modifying the base the ribose or the phosphodiester moiety. The changes can be tailor made to stabilize or destabilize hybrid formation or enhance the specificity of hybridization with a complementary nucleic acid sequence as desired.

The term nucleic acids as used herein may include any polymer or oligomer of pyrimidine and purine bases preferably cytosine thymine and uracil and adenine and guanine respectively. See Albert L. Lehninger PRINCIPLES OF BIOCHEMISTRY at 793 800 Worth Pub. 1982 . Indeed the present invention contemplates any deoxyribonucleotide ribonucleotide or peptide nucleic acid component and any chemical variants thereof such as methylated hydroxymethylated or glucosylated forms of these bases and the like. The polymers or oligomers may be heterogeneous or homogeneous in composition and may be isolated from naturally occurring sources or may be artificially or synthetically produced. In addition the nucleic acids may be DNA or RNA or a mixture thereof and may exist permanently or transitionally in single stranded or double stranded form including homoduplex heteroduplex and hybrid states.

When referring to arrays and microarrays the term oligonucleotide or sometimes refer by polynucleotide as used herein refers to a nucleic acid ranging from at least 2 preferable at least 8 and more preferably at least 20 nucleotides in length or a compound that specifically hybridizes to a polynucleotide. Polynucleotides of the present invention include sequences of deoxyribonucleic acid DNA or ribonucleic acid RNA which may be isolated from natural sources recombinantly produced or artificially synthesized and mimetics thereof. A further example of a polynucleotide of the present invention may be peptide nucleic acid PNA . The invention also encompasses situations in which there is a nontraditional base pairing such as Hoogsteen base pairing which has been identified in certain tRNA molecules and postulated to exist in a triple helix. Polynucleotide and oligonucleotide are used interchangeably in this application.

The term primer as used herein refers to a single stranded oligonucleotide capable of acting as a point of initiation for template directed DNA synthesis under suitable conditions for example buffer and temperature in the presence of four different nucleoside triphosphates and an agent for polymerization such as for example DNA or RNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase. The length of the primer in any given case depends on for example the intended use of the primer and generally ranges from 15 to 30 nucleotides. Short primer molecules generally require cooler temperatures to form sufficiently stable hybrid complexes with the template. A primer need not reflect the exact sequence of the template but must be sufficiently complementary to hybridize with such template. The primer site is the area of the template to which a primer hybridizes. The primer pair is a set of primers including a 5 upstream primer that hybridizes with the 5 end of the sequence to be amplified and a 3 downstream primer that hybridizes with the complement of the 3 end of the sequence to be amplified.

The term probe as used herein refers to a surface immobilized molecule that can be recognized by a particular target. See U.S. Pat. No. 6 582 908 for an example of arrays having all possible combinations of probes with 10 12 and more bases. Examples of probes that can be investigated by this invention include but are not restricted to agonists and antagonists for cell membrane receptors toxins and venoms viral epitopes hormones for example opioid peptides steroids etc. hormone receptors peptides enzymes enzyme substrates cofactors drugs lectins sugars oligonucleotides nucleic acids oligosaccharides proteins and monoclonal antibodies.

Also contemplated by the present invention are polypeptide protein arrays and microarrays. In certain embodiments such arrays comprise probes such as antibodies aptamers other cognate binding ligands and the like specific to a component of the sets disclosed herein. For example such probes are specific to the nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence set forth in Tables 1 32 36 45 and 47 79 or the attached sequence listing. Such arrays and methods of constructing the same are well known in the art for example U.S. Pat. Publ. Nos. 20060035277 20060166227 20050260653 20040199945 20030044320 20020102605 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 777 239 6 696 620 6 689 568 6 448 387 and 5 081 584.

One class of protein microarray useful in the context of the present invention uses an immobilized capture antibody. The polypeptides are bound to a solid substrate such as glass with a treated surface such as aminosilane or via a biotin streptavidin conjugation. The arrays are then incubated with a solution containing probe that will bind to the capture antibodies in a manner dependent upon time buffer components and recognition specificity. The probes may then be visualized directly if they have been previously labeled or may be allowed to bind to a secondary labeled reagent frequently another antibody. The means of visualizing the amount of probe bound to the capture antibody is dependent upon the labeling method utilized but is often by a CCD imager or laser scanner using filter sets that are appropriate to excite and detect the emissions of the label. The imager converts the amount of detected photons into an electronic signal often an 8 bit or 16 bit scale which can then be analyzed using software packages.

In another embodiment the present invention also provides a protein coated substrate comprising a plurality of patches arranged in discrete known regions on a substrate where each of the patches comprises an immobilized protein with a different known sequence and where each of the patches is separated from the neighboring patches by from about 50 nm to about 500 m. In a preferred embodiment the protein coated substrate comprises 9 or more patches.

Arrays of proteins are also provided by the present invention. In one embodiment the protein arrays comprise micrometer scale two dimensional patterns of proteins immobilized on arrays of functionalized surface patches.

In one embodiment the array of proteins comprises a plurality of patches preferably 9 or more arranged in discrete known regions on a substrate wherein each of the patches comprises an immobilized protein with a different known sequence and wherein each of the patches is separated from neighboring patches by from about 50 nm to about 500 m. In a preferred embodiment the patches are separated from neighboring patches from about 200 nm to about 500 m.

In some versions of the array the diameter of each of the patches is proportional to the distance separating the patches. Therefore the area of each patch may be from about 100 nmto about 40 000 m. Each patch preferably has an area from about 1 mto about 10 000 m.

In one embodiment of the array the array comprises 9 or more patches within a total area of 1 cm. In preferred embodiments of the array the array comprises 100 or more patches within a total area of 1 cm. In another embodiment the array comprises or more patches within a total area of 1 cm.

In one embodiment of the array the protein immobilized on one patch differs from the protein immobilized on a second patch of the same array.

The substrate of the array may be either organic or inorganic biological or non biological or any combination of these materials. In one embodiment the substrate is transparent or translucent. The portion of the surface of the substrate on which the patches reside is preferably flat and firm or semi firm. Numerous materials are suitable for use as a substrate in the array embodiment of the invention. For instance the substrate of the invention array can comprise a material selected from a group consisting of silicon silica quartz glass controlled pore glass carbon alumina titanium dioxide germanium silicon nitride zeolites and gallium arsenide. Many metals such as gold platinum aluminum copper titanium and their alloys are also options for substrates of the array. In addition many ceramics and polymers may also be used as substrates. Polymers which may be used as substrates include but are not limited to the following polystyrene poly tetra fluoroethylene poly vinylidenedifluoride polycarbonate polymethylmethacrylate polyvinylethylene polyethyleneimine poly etherether ketone polyoxymethylene POM polyvinylphenol polylactides polymethacrylimide PMI polyalkenesulfone PAS polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate polydimethylsiloxane polyacrylamide polyimide co block polymers and Eupergit . Photoresists polymerized Langmuir Blodgett films and LICA structures may also serve as substrates in the present invention. The preferred substrates for the array comprise silicon silica glass or a polymer.

In one embodiment of the invention array the patches further comprise a monolayer on the surface of the substrate and the proteins of the patches are unmobilized on the monolayer. The monolayer is preferably a self assembling monolayer. This monolayer may optionally comprise molecules of the formula X R Y wherein R is a spacer X is a functional group that binds R to the surface and Y is a functional group for binding proteins onto the monolayer.

A variety of chemical moieties may function as monolayers in the array of the present invention. However three major classes of monolayer formation are preferably used to expose high densities of bioreactive omega functionalities on the patches of the arrays i alkylsiloxane monolayers silanes on hydroxylated surfaces as taught in for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 405 766 PCT Publication WO 96 38.726 U.S. Pat. No. 5 412 087 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 688 642 ii allyl thiol dialkyldisulfide monolayers on noble metals preferably Au 111 as for example described in Allara et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 690 715 Bamdad et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 620 850 Wagner et al. Biophysical Journal 1996 70 2052 2066 and iii alkyl monolayer formation on oxide free passivated silicon as taught in for example Linford et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995 117 3145 3155 Wagner et al. Journal of structural Biology 1997 119 189 201 U.S. Pat. No. 5 429 708 . One of ordinary skill in the art however will recognize that many possible moieties may be substituted for X R and or Y dependent primarily upon the choice of substrate coating and affinity tag. Many examples of monolayers are described in Ulman An Introduction to Ultrathin Organic Films From Langmuir Blodgett to Self Assembly Academic press 1991 .

An array of the present invention may optionally further comprise a coating between the substrate and the monolayer of its patches. This coating may either be formed on the substrate or applied to the substrate. The substrate can be modified with a coating by using thin film technology based on either physical vapor deposition PVD or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD . Alternatively plasma exposure can be used to directly activate the substrate. For instance plasma etch procedures can be used to oxidize a polymeric surface i.e. polystyrene or polyethylene to expose polar functionalities such as hydroxyls carboxylic acids aldehydes and the like .

The coating may comprise a metal film. Possible metal films include aluminum chromium titanium nickel stainless steel zinc lead iron magnesium manganese cadmium tungsten cobalt and alloys or oxides thereof. In a preferred embodiment the metal film is a noble metal film. Noble metals that may be used for a coating include but are not limited to gold platinum silver copper and palladium. In another embodiment the coating comprises gold or a gold alloy. Electron beam evaporation may be used to provide a thin coating of gold on the surface. In yet a further embodiment the metal film is from about 50 nm to about 500 nm in thickness.

In alternative embodiments the coating comprises a composition selected from the group consisting of silicon silicon oxide silicon nitride silicon hydride indium tin oxide magnesium oxide alumina glass hydroxylated surfaces and a polymer.

An array of the present invention is typically comprised of a collection of addressable elements. Such elements can be spacially addressable such as arrays contained within microtiter plates or printed on planar surfaces where each element is present at distinct X and Y coordinates. Alternatively elements can be addressable based on tags beads nanoparticles or physical properties. The microarrays can be prepared according to the methods known to the ordinarily skilled artisan See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 522 Robinson et al. 2002 Nature Medicine 8 295 301 Robinson et al. 2002 46 885 93 . Arrays as used herein refers to any biologic assay with multiple addressable elements. In one embodiment the addressable elements are polypeptides e.g. antibodies or fragments thereof or nucleic acid probes. As used herein elements refer to any probe polypeptide or nucleic acid based that can be bound by an organ specific polypeptide polypeptide fragment or transcript encoding such polypeptides as set forth in the appended sequence listing and Tables 1 32 36 45 and 47 79. Molecules can be but are not limited to proteins polypeptides peptides RNA DNA lipids glycosylated molecules carbohydrates polypeptides with phosphorylation modifications and polypeptides with citrulline modifications aptamers oxidated molecules other molecules and other molecules.

For the elements described herein addressibility refers to the location position tags cleavable tags or markers identifiers spectral properties electrophoretic properties or other physical properties that enable identification of the element. One example of addressability also known as coding is spatial addressability where the position of the molecule is fixed and that position is correlated with the identity. This type of spatial array is generally synthesized or spotted onto a planar substrate producing for example microarrays where a large number of different molecules are densely laid out in a small area e.g. comprising at least about 400 different sequences per cm and may be 1000 sequences per cm or as many as 5000 sequences per cm or more. Less dense arrays such as may be found in ELISA or RIA plates where wells in a plate each contain a distinct probe may comprise from about 96 sequences per plate up to about 100 sequences per cm up to the density of a microarray. Other spatial arrays utilize fiber optics where distinct probes are bound to fibers which can then be formed into a bundle for binding and analysis. Methods for the manufacture and use of spatial arrays of polypeptides are known in the art. Recent articles include Joos et al. 2000 Electrophoresis 21 13 2641 50 describing a microarray based immunoassay containing serial dilutions of probes Roda et al. 2000 Biotechniques 28 3 492 6 describing a system obtained by adapting a commercial ink jet printer and used to produce mono and bidimensional arrays of spots containing protein on cellulose paper and Ge 2000 Nucleic Acids Res 28 2 e3 describing a universal protein array system for quantitative detection of protein protein protein DNA protein RNA and protein ligand interactions. See also Mendoza et al. 1999 High throughput microarray based enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA Biotechniques 27 778 780 and Lueking et al. 1999 Protein microarrays for gene expression and antibody screening Anal. Biochem. 270 103 111.

An alternative to this type of spatial coding array is the use of molecular tags where the target probes are attached to a detectable label or tag which provides coded information about the sequence of the probe. In certain cases these tags can be cleaved from the element and subsequently detected to identity the element. In another embodiment a set of probes may be synthesized or attached to a set of coded beads where each bead is linked to a distinct probe and where the beads are themselves coded in a manner that allows identification of the attached probe. The use of a multiplexed microsphere set for analysis of clinical samples by flow cytometry is described in International Patent application no. 97 14028 and Fulton et al. 1997 Clinical Chemistry 43 1749 1756 . It is also possible to use other addressable particles or tags reviewed in Robinson et al. 2002 Arthritis Rheumatism 46 885 93 .

In this type of tag array where the probe is bound to beads or microspheres one may utilize flow cytometry for detection of binding. For example microspheres having fluorescence coding have been described in the art where the color and level of fluorescence uniquely identifies a particular microsphere. The probe is thus covalently attached to a color coded object. A labeled target polypeptide can be detected by flow cytometry and the coding on the microsphere used to identify the bound probe e.g. immunoglobulin antigen binding fragments of immunoglobulins or ligands .

One embodiment of an array is an immunoglobulin e.g. antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof array. An immunoglobulin array as used herein refers to a spatially separated set of discrete molecular entities capable of binding to target polypeptides which are arranged in a manner that allows identification of the polypeptides contained within the sample. In other embodiments the array may comprise one or more of proteins polypeptides peptides RNA DNA lipid glycosylated molecules polypeptides with phosphorylation modifications and polypeptides with citrulline modifications aptamers other molecules and other molecules where different classes of molecules may be combined in an array.

Other detection techniques using click chemistry reagents Svenson et al. Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 57 15 2106 2129 2005 Kolb et al. Drug Discov. Today 8 24 1128 1137 2003 or fluorophore related technologies such as that utilized by Nanostring Technologies and described in US Patent Application Publication No. 20030013091 incorporated herein by reference. In short this aspect is directed at the use of a diverse population of unique labels for the detection identification and direct quantification of a wide variety of target analytes. In one embodiment the invention is directed to detecting nucleic acid analytes in a complex mixture by first contacting the mixture under conditions sufficient for hybridization with a plurality of target specific nucleic acid probes. These target specific nucleic acid probes called specifiers contain a target specific region and a region containing one or more unique genedigit sequences. The genedigits consist of repeated core element sequences that can be specifically bound by a complementary anti genedigit sequence which can contain a unique label. The mixture containing the nucleic acid analytes and the specifiers is then contacted with a corresponding plurality of labeled anti genedigits having a diversity sufficient to uniquely hybridize to genedigits within the specifiers. This allows the unique detection of a hybridized complex between analytes in the mixture and specifiers with unique labels.

The present invention also provides utilizing the organ specific sequences disclosed herein to detect and quantify analytes in a mixture by generating a diverse population of uniquely labeled probes contacting a mixture with these probes and detecting the complexes that result from hybridization of probes to analytes in the mixture. This technology may be applied in a variety of ways including identifying and quantifying the expression of genes in normal and diseased cells as well as aiding in the discovery of new drug and diagnostic targets.

The first step in this process involves producing a diverse population of uniquely labeled nucleic acid probes. This includes synthesizing a diverse population of target specific nucleic acid probes each having a different specifier synthesizing a population of anti genedigits capable of specifically binding to the gene digit of the probe and each having a unique label and hybridizing the target nucleic acid probes to the anti genedigits thereby producing a population of uniquely labeled probes. Since a specifier may contain one or several genedigits the methods herein may use multiple unique labels may be available to bind analytes in a mixture. Thus a large population of specifiers can be synthesized that contain several combinations of genedigits in order to label multiple analytes in a mixture. Conversely in order to label one or a few analytes in a mixture a specifier may be synthesized that contains one or a few genedigits.

Accordingly using such genedigits one can detect an analyte such as a nucleic acid analyte such as polypeptides or transcripts encoding the same from a tissue sample or a sample from a biological sample such as whole blood by contacting a mixture of analytes with a population of uniquely labeled probes under conditions sufficient for hybridization. Following this hybridization the signals are measured that result from one or more target specific probes bound to an analyte wherein the signal uniquely identifies the analyte.

The present invention provides a diverse population of uniquely labeled probes in which a target specific nucleic acid contains a nucleic acid bound to a unique label. In addition the invention provides a diverse population of uniquely labeled probes containing two attached populations of nucleic acids one population of nucleic acids containing thirty or more target specific nucleic acid probes and a second population of nucleic acids containing a nucleic acid bound by a unique label.

A target specific probe is intended to mean an agent that binds to the target analyte selectively. This agent will bind with preferential affinity toward the target while showing little to no detectable cross reactivity toward other molecules.

The target analyte can be any type of macromolecule including a nucleic acid a protein or even a small molecule drug. For example a target can be a nucleic acid that is recognized and bound specifically by a complementary nucleic acid including for example an oligonucleotide or a PCR product or a non natural nucleic acid such as a locked nucleic acid LNA or a peptide nucleic acid PNA . In addition a target can be a peptide that is bound by a nucleic acid. For example a DNA binding domain of a transcription factor can bind specifically to a particular nucleic acid sequence. Another example of a peptide that can be bound by a nucleic acid is a peptide that can be bound by an aptamer. Aptamers are nucleic acid sequences that have three dimensional structures capable of binding small molecular targets including metal ions organic dyes drugs amino acids co factors aminoglycosides antibiotics nucleotide base analogs nucleotides and peptides Jayasena S. D. Clinical Chemistry 45 9 1628 1650 1999 incorporated herein by reference. Further a target can be a peptide that is bound by another peptide or an antibody or antibody fragment. The binding peptide or antibody can be linked to a nucleic acid for example by the use of known chemistries including chemical and UV cross linking agents. In addition a peptide can be linked to a nucleic acid through the use of an aptamer that specifically binds the peptide. Other nucleic acids can be directly attached to the aptamer or attached through the use of hybridization. A target molecule can even be a small molecule that can be bound by an aptamer or a peptide ligand binding domain.

The invention further provides a method for detecting a nucleic acid analyte by contacting a mixture of nucleic acid analytes with a population of target specific probes each attached to a unique label under conditions sufficient for hybridization of the probes to the target and measuring the resulting signal from one or more of the target specific probes hybridized to an analyte where the signal uniquely identifies the analyte.

The nucleic acid analyte can contain any type of nucleic acid including for example an RNA population or a population of cDNA copies. The invention provides for at least one target specific probe for each analyte in a mixture. The invention also provides for a target specific probe that contains a nucleic acid bound to a unique label. Furthermore the invention provides two attached populations of nucleic acids one population of nucleic acids containing a plurality of target specific nucleic acid probes and a second population of nucleic acids containing a nucleic acid bound by a unique label. When the target specific probes are attached to unique labels this allows for the unique identification of the target analytes.

In order to identify organ specific transcripts the resulting annotated transcripts are compared against public and or private sequence databases such as a variety of annotated human genome sequence databases e.g. HUPO Genebank the EMBL and Japanese databases and databases generated and compiled from other normal tissues to identify those transcripts that are expressed primarily in the organ of interest but are not expressed in other organs. As noted elsewhere herein some expression in organs other than the organ of interest does not necessarily preclude the use of a particular transcript in an organ specific protein set or diagnostic panel of the present invention.

In certain embodiments a particular transcript is considered to be organ specific when the number of transcripts million as determined by MPSS is 3 copies million or greater in the organ of interest but is less than 3 copies million in all other organs examined where preferably 5 10 15 20 or 25 organs are examined. In another embodiment a transcript is considered organ specific if it is expressed in the organ of interest at a detectable levels using a standard measurement e.g. microarray analysis quantitative real time RT PCR MPSS SBS in the organ of interest but is not detectably expressed in other organs using appropriate negative and positive controls as would be familiar to the skilled artisan. In a further embodiment an organ specific transcript is one that is expressed 99 in one organ and the remaining 1 in one or more other organs examined. In this context total expression across all organs examined is taken as 100 . In certain embodiments an organ specific transcript is expressed at about 50 60 70 80 90 95 to about 99 in one organ and wherein the remaining 1 50 is expressed in one or more other organs examined. As would be readily recognized by the skilled artisan upon reading the present disclosure in certain embodiments an organ specific blood fingerprint can readily be discerned even if some expression of an organ specific protein from a particular organ is detected at some levels in another organ or even more than one organ. This is because the fingerprint e.g. the combination of the levels of multiple proteins the pattern of the expression levels of multiple markers itself is unique despite that the expression levels of one or more individual members of the fingerprint may not be unique to a particular organ. Thus the present invention relates to determining the presence or absence of a disease or condition or stage of disease based on a single marker or a pattern e.g. fingerprint of markers measured concurrently using any one or more of a variety of methods described herein e.g. antibody binding mass spectrometry and the like .

In certain embodiments the organ specificity of a transcript is determined using the algorithms as outlined in Example 1 or Example 9.

In further embodiments organ specificity can be confirmed at the protein level using immunohistochemistry IHC and or other protein measurement techniques known in the art e.g. isotope coded affinity tags and mass spectrometry such as described by Han D. K. et al. 19 946 951 2001 . The Z test Man M. Z. et al. 16 953 959 2000 or other appropriate statistical tests can be used to calculate P values for comparison of gene and protein expression levels between libraries from organs of interest.

Any of a variety of statistical methods known in the art and described herein can be used to evaluate organ specificity and as discussed further herein define statistical changes in the level of a particular protein measured between a normal control sample of blood and a blood sample that is changed from normal. Exemplary statistical methods include for example discriminant analysis classification analysis cluster analysis analysis of variance ANOVA regression analysis regression trees decision trees nearest neighbor algorithms principal components factor analysis multidimensional scaling and other methods of dimensionality reduction likelihood models hypothesis testing kernel density estimation and other smoothing techniques cross validation and other methods to guard against overfitting of the data the bootstrap and other statistical resampling techniques artificial intelligence including artificial neural networks machine learning data mining and boosting algorithms and Bayesian analysis using prior probability distributions see e.g. U.S. Patent Application No. 20020095259 .

Comparisons of the transcripts between databases can be made using a variety of computer analysis algorithms known in the art. As such alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local identity algorithm of Smith and Waterman 1981 2 482 by the identity alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch 1970 48 443 by the search for similarity methods of Pearson and Lipman 1988 85 2444 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT BLAST FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Genetics Computer Group GCG 575 Science Dr. Madison Wis. or by inspection. As would be understood by the skilled artisan many algorithms are available and are continually being developed. Appropriate algorithms can be chosen based on the specific needs for the comparisons being made See also e.g. J. A. Cuff et al. 16 2 111 116 2000 S. F Altschul and B. W.

The organ specific protein sets may be further characterized using computational methods to predict localization. In one embodiment protein sequences in the RefSeq database are used to predict protein localization. One of the programs is TMHMM server 2.0 http colon double slash www dot cbs dot dtu dot dk services TMHMM which applies hidden Markov model to predict protein transmembrane domains and is considered as one of the best such programs. Another program that can be used in this context is SignalP server 3.0 http colon double slash www dot cbs dot dtu dot dk services SignalP which applies both artificial neural network and hidden Markov model to predict the presence and the location of signal peptide cleavage sites for classical N terminus lead proteins. The outputs of the two programs can be combined into protein localization prediction such as is outlined in Table 33.

Illustrative computational analyses that can be used for predicting proteins with signal peptides classical secretory proteins include but are not limited to the criteria described by Chen at al. 14 859 865 2003. In certain embodiments such analyses are carried out using prediction servers for example SignalP 3.0 server developed by The Center for Biological Sequence Analysis Lyngby Denmark http colon double slash www dot cbs dot dtu dot dk services SignalP 3.0 see also J. D. Bendtsen et al. 340 783 795 2004. and the TMHMM2.0 server see for example A. Krogh et al. 305 3 567 580 January 2001 E. L. L. Sonnhammer at al. In J. Glasgow T. Littlejohn F. Major R. Lathrop D. Sankoff and C. Sensen editors pages 175 182 Menlo Park Calif. 1998. AAAI Press . Other prediction methods that can be used in the context of the present invention include those described for example in S. Moller M. D. R. et al. 17 7 646 653 July 2001. Nonclassical secretory secreted proteins without signal peptides can be predicted using for example the SecretomeP 1.0 server with an odds ratio score 3.0. Other methods known in the art are also contemplated herein and Sigfind.

As would be recognized by the skilled artisan while the organ specific proteins the levels of which make up a given normal or disease associated fingerprint need not be isolated in certain embodiments it may be desirable to isolate such proteins e.g. for antibody production or for developing other detection reagents as described herein . As such the present invention provides for isolated organ specific proteins or fragments or portions thereof and polynucleotides that encode such proteins. As used herein the terms protein and polypeptide are used interchangeably. Illustrative organ specific proteins include those provided in the amino acid sequences set forth in the appended sequence listing. The terms polypeptide and protein encompass amino acid chains of any length including full length endogenous i.e. native proteins and variants of endogenous polypeptides described herein. Variants are polypeptides that differ in sequence from the polypeptides of the present invention only in substitutions deletions and or other modifications such that either the variants disease specific expression patterns are not significantly altered or the polypeptides remain useful for diagnostics detection of organ specific proteins as described herein. For example modifications to the polypeptides of the present invention may be made in the laboratory to facilitate expression and or purification and or to improve immunogenicity for the generation of appropriate antibodies and other detection agents. Modified variants e.g. chemically modified of organ specific proteins may be useful herein e.g. as standards in mass spectrometry analyses of the corresponding proteins in the blood and the like . As such in certain embodiments the biological function of a variant protein is not relevant for utility in the methods for detection and or diagnostics described herein. Polypeptide variants generally encompassed by the present invention will typically exhibit at least about 70 75 80 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 or more identity along its length to a polypeptide sequence set forth herein. Within a polypeptide variant amino acid substitutions are usually made at no more than 50 of the amino acid residues in the native polypeptide and in certain embodiments at no more than 25 of the amino acid residues. In certain embodiments such substitutions are conservative. A conservative substitution is one in which an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid that has similar properties such that one skilled in the art of peptide chemistry would expect the secondary structure and hydropathic nature of the polypeptide to be substantially unchanged. In general the following amino acids represent conservative changes 1 ala pro gly glu asp gln asn ser thr 2 cys ser tyr thr 3 val ile leu met ala phe 4 lys arg his and 5 phe tyr trp his. Thus a variant may comprise only a portion of a native polypeptide sequence as provided herein. In addition or alternatively variants may contain additional amino acid sequences such as for example linkers tags and or ligands usually at the amino and or carboxy termini. Such sequences may be used for example to facilitate purification detection or cellular uptake of the polypeptide.

When comparing polypeptide sequences two sequences are said to be identical if the sequence of amino acids in the two sequences is the same when aligned for maximum correspondence as described below. Comparisons between two sequences are typically performed by comparing the sequences over a comparison window to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A comparison window as used herein refers to a segment of at least about 20 contiguous positions usually 30 to about 75 40 to about 50 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned.

Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted using the Megalign program in the Lasergene suite of bioinformatics software DNASTAR Inc. Madison Wis. using default parameters. This program embodies several alignment schemes described in the following references Dayhoff M. O. 1978 A model of evolutionary change in proteins Matrices for detecting distant relationships. In Dayhoff M. O. ed. National Biomedical Research Foundation Washington D.C. Vol. 5 Suppl. 3 pp. 345 358 Hein J. 1990 Unified Approach to Alignment and Phylogenes pp. 626 645 vol. 183 Academic Press Inc. San Diego Calif. Higgins D. G. and Sharp P. M. 1989 5 151 153 Myers E.

J. 1983 80 726 730.

Alternatively optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local identity algorithm of Smith and Waterman 1981 2 482 by the identity alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch 1970 48 443 by the search for similarity methods of Pearson and Lipman 1988 85 2444 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT BLAST FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Genetics Computer Group GCG 575 Science Dr. Madison Wis. or by inspection.

Illustrative examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity include the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms which are described in Altschul et al. 1977 25 3389 3402 and Altschul et al. 1990 215 403 410 respectively. BLAST and BLAST 2.0 can be used for example to determine percent sequence identity for the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information.

An isolated polypeptide is one that is removed from its original environment. For example a naturally occurring protein or polypeptide is isolated if it is separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system. In certain embodiments such polypeptides are also purified e.g. are at least about 90 pure by weight of protein in the preparation in some embodiments at least about 95 pure by weight of protein in the preparation and in further embodiments at least about 99 pure by weight of protein in the preparation.

In one embodiment of the present invention a polypeptide comprises a fusion protein comprising an organ specific polypeptide. The present invention further provides fusion proteins that comprise at least one polypeptide as described herein as well as polynucleotides encoding such fusion proteins. The fusion proteins may comprise multiple polypeptides or portions variants thereof as described herein and may further comprise one or more polypeptide segments for facilitating the expression purification detection and or activity of the polypeptide s .

In certain embodiments the proteins and or polynucleotides and or fusion proteins are provided in the form of compositions e.g. pharmaceutical compositions vaccine compositions compositions comprising a physiologically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such compositions may comprise buffers such as neutral buffered saline phosphate buffered saline and the like carbohydrates such as glucose mannose sucrose or dextrans mannitol proteins polypeptides or amino acids such as glycine antioxidants chelating agents such as EDTA or glutathione adjuvants e.g. aluminum hydroxide and preservatives.

In certain embodiments wash buffer refers to a solution that may be used to wash and remove unbound material from an adsorbent surface. Wash buffers typically include salts that may or may not buffer pH within a specified range detergents and optionally may include other ingredients useful in removing adventitiously associated material from a surface or complex.

In certain embodiments elution buffer refers to a solution capable of dissociating a binding moiety and an associated analyte. In some circumstances an elution buffer is capable of disrupting the interaction between subunits when the subunits are associated in a complex. As with wash buffers elution buffers may include detergents salt organic solvents and may be used separately or as mixtures. Typically these latter reagents are present at higher concentrations in an elution buffer than in a wash buffer making the elution buffer more disruptive to molecular interactions. This ability to disrupt molecular interactions is termed stringency with elution buffers having greater stringency that wash buffers.

In general organ specific polypeptides and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides as described herein may be prepared using any of a variety of techniques that are well known in the art. For example a polynucleotide encoding an organ specific protein may be prepared by amplification from a suitable cDNA or genomic library using for example polymerase chain reaction PCR or hybridization techniques. Libraries may generally be prepared and screened using methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as those described in Sambrook et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989. cDNA libraries may be prepared from any of a variety of organs tissues cells as described herein. Other libraries that may be employed will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the present disclosure. Primers for use in amplification may be readily designed based on the polynucleotide sequences encoding organ specific polypeptides as provided herein for example using programs such as the PRIMER3 program see website http colon double slash www dash genome dot wi dot mit dot edu slash cgi dash bin slash primer slash primer3 www dot cgi .

Polynucleotides encoding the organ specific polypeptides as described herein are also provided by the present invention. Polynucleotides of the present invention may comprise a native sequence i.e. an endogenous polynucleotide for instance a native or non artificially engineered or naturally occurring gene as provided herein encoding an organ specific protein an alternate form of such a sequence or a portion or splice variant thereof or may comprise a variant of such a sequence. Polynucleotide variants may contain one or more substitutions additions deletions and or insertions such that the polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide useful in the methods described herein such as for the detection of organ specific proteins e.g. wherein said polynucleotide variants encode polypeptides that can be used to generate detection reagents as described herein that specifically bind to an organ specific protein . In certain embodiments variants exhibit at least about 70 identity and in other embodiments exhibit at least about 80 85 86 87 88 89 identity and in yet further embodiments at least about 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 identity to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native organ specific polypeptide or an alternate form or a portion thereof. Illustrative polynucleotides of the present invention comprise the polynucleotides of set forth in the sequence listing attached hereto. The percent identity may be readily determined by comparing sequences using computer algorithms well known to those having ordinary skill in the art and described herein.

A polynucleotide as used herein may be single stranded coding or antisense or double stranded and may be DNA genomic cDNA or synthetic or RNA molecules. Thus within the context of the present invention a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide may also be a gene. A gene is a segment of DNA involved in producing a polypeptide chain it includes regions preceding and following the coding region leader and trailer as well as intervening sequences introns between individual coding segments exons . Additional coding or non coding sequences may but need not be present within a polynucleotide of the present invention and a polynucleotide may but need not be linked to other molecules and or support materials. An isolated polynucleotide as used herein means that a polynucleotide is substantially away from other coding sequences and that the DNA molecule does not contain large portions of unrelated coding DNA such as large chromosomal fragments or other functional genes or polypeptide coding regions. Of course this refers to the DNA molecule as originally isolated and does not exclude genes or coding regions later added to the segment using recombinant techniques known to the skilled artisan. Polynucleotides that are complementary to the polynucleotides described herein or that have substantial identity to a sequence complementary to a polynucleotide as described herein are also within the scope of the present invention. Substantial identity as used herein refers to polynucleotides that exhibit at least about 70 identity and in certain embodiments at least about 80 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 identity to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native organ specific polypeptide as described herein. Substantial identity can also refer to polynucleotides that are capable of hybridizing under stringent conditions to a polynucleotide complementary to a polynucleotide encoding an organ specific protein. Suitable hybridization conditions include prewashing in a solution of 5 SSC 0.5 SDS 1.0 mM EDTA pH 8.0 hybridizing at 50 65 C. 5 SSC overnight followed by washing twice at 65 C. for 20 minutes with each of 2 0.5 and 0.2 SSC containing 0.1 SDS. Nucleotide sequences that because of code degeneracy encode a polypeptide encoded by any of the above sequences are also encompassed by the present invention. Lastly it should be understood by the skilled artisan that RNA as well as cDNA derived therefrom as well as the coding and non coding strands may also be utilized in the methods or as panels described herein in the place of proteins or antibodies thereto.

A normal serum organ specific protein set comprises the subset of proteins from an organ specific protein set that are detected in normal serum. Identification of organ specific proteins from a given organ specific protein set that are found in normal serum can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art. For example antibodies specific for the proteins can be used to measure the presence of the protein in blood serum plasma or tissue sample biopsy by a variety of immunoaffinity based techniques e.g. immunoblot Western analysis immunoprecipitation ELISA . Antibodies specific for the proteins described herein may be commercially available through any of a number of sources known to the skilled artisan or may be generated using techniques known in the art and described herein See e.g. Harlow and Lane Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 1988 .

As an alternative aptamers short DNA or RNA fragments with binding complementarily to the proteins of interest may be used in assays similar to those described for antibodies see for example 2001 February 30 2 290 2 294 51999 45 1628 1650 . In this regard an aptamer may be selected for specific binding properties and may be used in a similar manner to an antibody in a variety of appropriate binding assays known to the skilled artisan and described herein In addition antibodies or aptamers may be used in connection with nanowires to create highly sensitive detections systems see e.g. J. Heath et al. Science. 2004 Dec. 17 306 5704 2055 6 . In further embodiments mass spectrometry based methods can be used to confirm the presence of a particular protein in the blood.

A variety of mass spectrometry systems can be employed in the methods of the invention for identifying and or quantifying organ specific proteins in blood. Mass analyzers with high mass accuracy high sensitivity and high resolution include but are not limited to ion trap triple quadrupole and time of flight quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometers and Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass analyzers FT ICR MS . Mass spectrometers are typically equipped with matrix assisted laser desorption MALDI and electrospray ionization ESI ion sources although other methods of peptide ionization can also be used. In ion trap MS analytes are ionized by ESI or MALDI and then put into an ion trap. Trapped ions can then be separately analyzed by MS upon selective release from the ion trap. Organ specific proteins can be analyzed for example by single stage mass spectrometry with a MALDI TOF or ESI TOF system. Methods of mass spectrometry analysis are well known to those skilled in the art see for example Yates . 1998 33 1 19 Kinter and Sherman Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry John Wiley Sons New York 2000 Aebersold and Goodlett . 2001 101 269 295 Banez et al 2005 15 151 156 . For high resolution protein separation liquid chromatography ESI MS MS or automated LC MS MS which utilizes capillary reverse phase chromatography as the separation method can be used Yates et al. . 1999 112 553 569 .

In another embodiment organ specific proteins may be detected and analyzed by immunoaffinity based assays such as ELISAs Western blots and radioimmunoassays. Other methods useful in this context include isotope coded affinity tag ICAT followed by multidimensional chromatography and MS MS. The procedures described herein for analysis of blood can be modified and adapted to make use of microfluidics and nanotechnology in order to miniaturize parallelize integrate and automate diagnostic procedures see e.g. L. Hood et al. 2004 306 640 643 R. H. Carlson et al. . 1997 79 2149 A. Y. Fu at al. . 2002 74 2451 J. W. Hong at al. . 2004 22 435 A. G. Hadd et al. . 1997 69 3407 I. Karube at al. . 1995 750 101 L. C. Waters et al. . 1998 70 158 J. Fritz et al. 2000 288 316 .

The levels of organ specific proteins in blood can also be measured using any one or more methods such as nucleic acid based or polypeptide peptide based microarrays.

Methods for measuring organ specific protein levels from blood serum plasma include but are not limited to immunoaffinity based assays such as ELISAs Western blots and radioimmunoassays fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS and mass spectrometry based methods matrix assisted laser desorption ionization MALDI MALDI Time of Flight TOF Tandem MS MS MS electrospray ionization ESI Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionization SELDI TOF MS Xiao at al. 230 95 106 2005 liquid chromatography LC MS MS . Other methods useful in proteomic analysis include 2 D Difference Gel Electrophoresis DIGE and protein arrays see e.g. Unlu et al. 18 2071 1997 Tonge et al 1 377 2001 Macbeath et al. 289 1760 2000 Walter at al. Trends in Molecular Medicine 8 250 2002 .

In one embodiment the organ specific proteins that are being measured are glycosylated. Thus in certain embodiments the invention contemplates the use of protein glycocapture methods for preparing proteins for analysis. Protein glycosylation is a very common post translational modification. In particular N linked glycosylation is common in proteins that move to extracellular environments. These include proteins on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane secreted proteins and proteins contained in body fluids. Body fluids include but are not limited to cerebrospinal fluid blood serum urine breast milk saliva pancreatic juice peritoneal lacrimal reproductive intraocular digestive respiratory pleural pericardial lymphatic urine intracellular and extracellular fluids and neural fluids. This list is for illustrative purposes and it is not meant to be limiting. Zhang et al. 6 660 2003 . Glycoproteins are isolated from any of a variety of tissue samples or plasma using methods as described in US Patent Application No. 20040023306. After isolating glycopolypeptides from a sample and cleaving the glycopolypeptide into fragments the glycopeptide fragments released from the solid support and the released glycopeptide fragments are identified and or quantified. A particularly useful method for analysis of the released glycopeptide fragments is mass spectrometry. For high resolution polypeptide fragment separation liquid chromatography ESI MS MS or automated LC MS MS which utilizes capillary reverse phase chromatography as the separation method can be used Yates et al. Methods Mol. Biol. 112 553 569 1999 . Data dependent collision induced dissociation CID with dynamic exclusion can also be used as the mass spectrometric method Goodlett et al. Anal. Chem. 72 1112 1118 2000 . Once a peptide is analyzed by MS MS the resulting CID spectrum can be compared to databases for the determination of the identity of the isolated glycopeptide. Methods for protein identification using single peptides has been described previously Aebersold and Goodlett Chem. Rev. 101 269 295 2001 Yates J. Mass Spec. 33 1 19 1998 .

In one embodiment normal healthy blood samples are collected from healthy subjects proteins present in the blood are identified using for example mass spectrometry and the proteins identified in this manner are compared to the organ specific proteins provided in Tables 1 32 36 45 and 47 79 using any of a variety of computational methods readily known in the art.

Normal serum organ specific proteins are generally identified from a sample of blood collected from a subject using accepted techniques. In one embodiment blood samples are collected in evacuated serum separator tubes. In another embodiment blood may be collected in blood collection tubes that contain any anti coagulant. Illustrative anticoagulants include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA and lithium heparin. However any method of blood sample or other bodily fluid or biological tissue sample collection and storage is contemplated herein. In particular blood may be collected by any portal including the finger foot intravenous lines and portable catheter lines. In one embodiment blood is centrifuged and the serum layer that separates from the red cells is collected for analysis. In another embodiment whole blood or plasma is used for analysis.

In certain embodiments a normal blood sample is obtained from human serum recovered from whole blood donations from an FDA approved clinical source. In this embodiment the normal healthy donor hematocrit is between the range of 38 and 55 the donor weight is over 110 pounds the donor age is between 18 and 65 years old the donor blood pressure is in the range of 90 180 mmHg systolic and 50 100 mmHg diastolic the arms and general appearance of the donor are free of needle marks and any mark signifying risky behavior. The donor pulse should be between 50 bpm 100 bpm the temperature of the donor should be between 97 and 99.5 degrees. The donor does not have diseases including but not limited to chest pain heart disease or lung disease including tuberculosis cancer skin disease any blood disease or bleeding problems yellow jaundice liver disease hepatitis or a positive test for hepatitis. The donor has not had close contact with hepatitis in the past 12 months nor has the donor ever received pituitary growth hormones.

In certain embodiments disease free blood is as follows the donor has not made a donation of blood within the previous 8 weeks the donor has not had a fever with headache within one week from the date of donation the donor has not donated a double unit of red cells using an aphaeresis machine within the previous 16 weeks the donor is not ill with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS nor has the donor had close contact with someone with SARS nor has the donor visited SARS affected areas. The donor has had no sexual contact with anyone who has HIV AIDS or has had a positive test for the HIV AIDS virus and does not have syphilis or gonorrhea. From 1977 to present the donor never received money drugs or other payment for sex male donors have never had sexual contact with another male donors have not had a positive test for the HIV AIDS virus donors have not used needles to take drugs steroids or anything not prescribed by a physician donors have not used clotting factor concentrates donors have not had sexual contact with anyone who was born in or lived in Africa or traveled to Africa.

Thus the present invention provides the normal serum level of components that make up a normal serum organ specific protein set. This level is an average of the levels of a given component measured in a statistically large number of blood samples from normal healthy individuals. Thus a predetermined normal level is a statistical range of normal and is also referred to herein as predetermined normal range . The normal levels or range of levels in the blood for each component are determined by measuring the level of protein in the blood using any of a variety of techniques known in the art and described herein in a sufficient number of blood samples from normal healthy individuals to determine the standard deviation SD with statistically meaningful accuracy.

As would be recognized by the skilled artisan upon reading the present disclosure in determining the normal serum level of a particular component of an organ specific protein set general biological data is considered and compared including for example gender time of day of blood sampling fasting or after food intake age race environment and or polymorphisms. Biological data may also include data concerning the height growth rate cardiovascular status reproductive status pre pubertal pubertal post pubertal pre menopausal menopausal post menopausal fertile infertile body fat percentage and body fat distribution. This list of individual differences that can be measured is exemplary and additional biological data is contemplated.

Thus the levels of the components that make up a normal serum organ specific protein set are determined. Normal organ specific blood fingerprints comprise a data set comprising determined levels in blood from normal healthy individuals of one two three four five six seven eight nine ten or more components of a normal serum organ specific protein set. The normal levels in the blood for each component included in a fingerprint are determined by measuring the level of protein in the blood using any of a variety of techniques known in the art and described herein in a sufficient number of blood samples from normal healthy individuals to determine the standard deviation SD with statistically meaningful accuracy. Thus as would be recognized by one of skill in the art a determined normal level is defined by averaging the level of protein measured in a statistically large number of blood samples from normal healthy individuals and thereby defining a statistical range of normal. A normal organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels in normal healthy blood of N members of a normal serum organ specific protein set wherein N is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 or more members up to the total number of members in a given normal serum organ specific protein set. In certain embodiments a normal organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels in normal healthy blood of at least two components of a normal serum organ specific protein set. In other embodiments a normal organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels in normal healthy blood of at least 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 or 20 components of a normal serum organ specific protein set. In yet further embodiments a normal control would be run at the time of the assay such that only the presence of a normal sample and the test sample would be necessary and the specific differences between the test sample and the normal sample would then be delineated based upon the panels provided herein.

As would be understood by the skilled artisan upon reading the present disclosure the subset of proteins from the organ specific protein set that are found in blood may comprise proteins that are predicted to be secreted anchored transmembrane or other intracellular proteins. In this regard a variety of methods as described herein can be used for predicting and defining protein localization. As would be recognized by the skilled artisan anchored transmembrane and intracellular proteins may be detected in the blood for a variety of reasons. For example the attachment linkages of anchored proteins may be cleaved by enzymes or by proteases and thereby be identified in the blood or biological fluids as an anchored protein. Anchored and transmembrane organ specific proteins may also be shed into the blood. Further organ specific proteins that are predicted to be localized intracellularly may be leaked or excreted into the blood. In specific embodiments of the present invention panels and detection methods may comprise components from or that detect only organ specific secreted proteins or transcripts thereof or components that are leaked excreted or shed but not normally secreted by use of a secretion signal or by means of an alternative secretion method such as leaderless proteins e.g. FGF 1 FGF 2 IL 1 IL 1 aldose reductase PD ECGF CNTF prothymosin parathymosin galectin 1 Factor XIIIa ATL derived factor annexin 1 transglutaminase mammary derived growth inhibitor macrophage migration inhibitory factor MIF HIV tat ATP synthase aminoacyl tRNA synthetase EMAP rhodanase thioredoxin like protein and others.

In certain embodiments the ability to detect an organ specific protein in blood may be hampered due to sensitivity or other issues. As such the present invention contemplates detection of organ specific proteins from any of a variety of tissue sources and bodily fluids. Thus organ specific proteins can be measured from biopsy samples from normal or diseased organ or any bodily fluid such as but not limited to cerebrospinal fluid blood serum urine breast milk saliva pancreatic juice peritoneal lacrimal reproductive intraocular digestive respiratory pleural pericardial lymphatic urine intracellular and extracellular fluids and neural fluids. The present invention also contemplates detection of organ specific proteins at the transcript level from any of these tissue sources using polynucleotide based detection methods known in the art and described herein.

The normal serum organ specific protein sets defined herein and the predetermined normal levels of the components that make up the organ specific protein sets e.g. the database of predetermined normal serum levels of organ specific proteins can be used as a baseline against which one can determine any perturbation of the normal state. Perturbation of the normal biological state is identified by measuring levels of organ specific proteins from a patient and comparing the measured levels against the predetermined normal levels. Any level that is statistically significantly altered from the normal level i.e. any level from the disease sample that is outside either above or below the predetermined normal range indicates a perturbation of normal and thus the presence of disease or effect of a drug or environmental agent etc. . In this way the predetermined normal levels of normal serum organ specific proteins are also used to identify and define disease associated blood fingerprints. Such sets or panels typically comprise proteins or nucleic acid molecules that are organ specific but that may be found in a bodily fluid or tissue sample. In certain embodiments the present methods panels and sets are directed to either collective sets or individual sets of organ specific proteins that can be detected in a bodily fluid and are secreted leaked excreted or shed. In certain specific embodiments the present invention is directed to sets of proteins including antibodies and fragments that bind thereto that are secreted or the nucleic acid molecules that encode the same or nucleic acid probes that bind thereto. As used herein a panel may comprise less than the entire set of sequences defined in the tables attached hereto for a given organ. For example as can be readily appreciated by the skilled artisan 1 transcript or protein of each organ may be enough to generally monitor the health of an organ. However increasing the number of probes targeting the component nucleic acid or polypeptide while not necessary will add specificity and sensitivity to the assay. Accordingly in certain aspects at least 5 probes per organ set for organ specific components will be present in the panel in other aspects at least 10 probes per organ set will be present yet in others there may be 20 30 40 50 or more probes present per organ set. In certain embodiments probes per set may include 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween.

Thus the present invention provides panels for detecting and measuring the level of organ specific proteins in blood that can be used in a variety of diagnostic settings. As used herein and discussed further below diagnostic panel or prognostic panel is meant to encompass panels arrays mixtures and kits that may comprise detection reagents or probes specific to an organ specific component or a control control nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences may or may not be a component of an organ specific set and any of a variety of associated buffers solutions appropriate negative and positive controls instruction sets and the like. A detection reagent as used herein is meant to refer to any agent that that associates or binds directly or indirectly to a molecule in the test sample. In certain embodiments a detection reagent may comprise antibodies or fragments thereof either with a secondary detection reagent attached thereto or without nucleic acid probes aptamers click reagents etc. Further a panel may comprise panels arrays mixtures kits or other arrangements of proteins antibodies or fragments thereof to organ specific proteins nucleic acid molecules encoding organ specific proteins nucleic acid probes to that hybridize to organ specific nucleic acid sequences. Moreover a panel may be derived from only one organ or two or more organs. In certain embodiments organs that comprise a certain system such as the cardiovascular or central nervous system may be grouped together.

The present invention provides panels for detecting the organ specific blood proteins at any given time in a subject. Examples of subjects include humans monkeys apes dogs cats mice rats fish zebra fish birds horses pigs cows sheep goats chickens ducks donkeys turkeys peacocks chinchillas ferrets gerbils rabbits guinea pigs hamsters and transgenic species thereof. Further subjects contemplated herein include but are not limited to reptiles and amphibians e.g. lizards snakes turtles frogs toads salamanders and newts and transgenic species thereof.

The panels are comprised of a plurality e.g. at least two of detection reagents that each specifically detects a protein or transcript in most embodiments substantially all are organ specific but may also comprise non organic specific reagents for use as controls or other purposes. In certain aspects the panels comprise detection reagents that each specifically detects a protein or transcript an organ specific protein wherein the levels of organ specific proteins taken together form a unique pattern that defines a fingerprint. In certain embodiments detection reagents can be bispecific such that the panel is comprised of a plurality of bispecific detection reagents that may specifically detect more than one organ specific protein. The term specifically is a term of art that would be readily understood by the skilled artisan to mean in this context that the protein of interest is detected by the particular detection reagent but other proteins are not substantially detected. Specificity can be determined using appropriate positive and negative controls and by routinely optimizing conditions.

The diagnostic panels of the present invention comprise detection reagents wherein each detection reagent is specific for one protein or transcript of an organ or tissue but as noted above may also comprise controls that are not or may not be specific to a particular organ tissue specific protein or transcript. In certain embodiments the detection reagents of a panel can each be specific for organ specific proteins from one organ specific protein set or from more than one organ specific protein set. For example a particular diagnostic panel may comprise detection reagents that detect one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty forty one forty two forty three forty four forty five forty six forty seven forty eight forty nine fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety one hundred or more prostate specific proteins such as those provided in Table 21 or a diagnostic panel may comprise detection reagents that detect one or more bladder specific proteins and one or more kidney specific proteins.

In specific embodiments and as noted above diagnostic or prognostic panels may include panels having reagents e.g. probes that bind organ specific proteins or transcripts from one or more organs. To this end it is envisioned that a panel such as an microarray can have placed thereon multiple protein or nucleic acid probes which specifically bind the organ specific protein or transcript identified by the methods herein and or expressly recited in the tables and sequence listing provided herewith. Further such an array may have placed thereon probes specific for one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty or more organs. Further each organ could be represented with one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty forty one forty two forty three forty four forty five forty six forty seven forty eight forty nine fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety one hundred or more probes. Moreover a single array may comprise organs associated with a particular bodily system such as the reproductive system ovaries uterus etc. cardiovascular system heart lungs etc. respiratory system nervous system endocrine system skeletal system etc. Lastly it is contemplated that one could utilize a general health panel that screens one or more organ tissue specific proteins or transcripts from nearly every organ and if an anomaly is noted a follow up screen with a more detailed panel comprising additional probes for the anomalous organ.

In certain embodiments the diagnostic panels comprise one or more detection reagents. In another embodiment a diagnostic panel of the invention may comprise two or more detection reagents. Thus the diagnostic panels of the invention may comprise a plurality of detection reagents. As would be recognized by the skilled artisan the number of detection reagents on a given panel would be determined from the number of organ specific proteins to be measured. In this regard the plurality of detection reagents may be anywhere from 2 to 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 150 160 170 180 190 200 or more detection reagents each specific for an organ specific protein. In specific embodiments the panel may comprise for example 10 50 probes per organ tissue cell type and probe 30 50 organs tissues or more. Accordingly such arrays panels may comprise 2500 or more probes. In one embodiment the panels of the invention comprises at least 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 detection reagents each specific for one of the plurality of organ specific proteins that make up a given fingerprint. In another embodiment the panel comprises at least 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 or 20 detection reagents each specific for one of the plurality of organ specific proteins that make up a given fingerprint. In a further embodiment the panel comprises at least 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 or 30 detection reagents each specific for one of the plurality of organ specific proteins that make up a given fingerprint. In an additional embodiment the panel comprises at least 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 or 40 detection reagents each specific for one of the plurality of organ specific proteins that make up a given fingerprint. In yet a further embodiment the panel comprises at least 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 or 50 detection reagents each specific for one of the plurality of organ specific proteins that make up a given fingerprint. In an additional embodiment the panel comprises at least 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 or 60 detection reagents each specific for one of the plurality of organ specific proteins that make up a given fingerprint. In one embodiment the panel comprises at least 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 or 70 detection reagents each specific for one of the plurality of organ specific proteins that make up a given fingerprint. In one embodiment the panel comprises at least 75 80 85 90 100 150 160 170 180 190 200 or more detection reagents each specific for one of the plurality of organ specific proteins that make up a given fingerprint.

In one aspect the detection reagents specific for the organ tissue specific transcripts may be utilized in a multiparameter analysis method such as a method of classifying a population by drug responsiveness comprising a determining a multidimensional coordinate point representative of the expression levels of a sample of molecules in a specimen from individuals in a population of individuals administered a drug and b determining a drug response associated reference expression region of a group of individuals in said population using said multidimensional coordinate points thereby classifying said group of individuals into a drug response reference population. Accordingly the method provides a means of determining a comparative expression profile in an individual by comparing the expression levels of a sample of molecules in a population of molecules in a specimen from the individual with a health associated reference expression region of the sample of molecules wherein expression levels within the health associated reference expression region indicate a reference expression profile and wherein expression levels outside the health associated reference expression region indicate a perturbed expression profile. In addition the method can be used for diagnosing a disease or a health state in an individual by comparing the expression level of a sample of molecules in a specimen from the individual with a health associated reference expression region of the sample of molecules. Additionally the reagent probes may be used in a method of classifying a population by drug responsiveness such methods are described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020095259.

Panels of the invention comprise N detection reagents wherein N is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 or more detection reagents up to the total number of members in a given organ specific protein set that are to be detected. As noted above in certain embodiments it may be desirable to detect proteins from two or more organ specific protein sets. Accordingly the diagnostic panels of the invention may comprise N detection reagents wherein N is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 or more detection reagents up to the total number of members in one or more organ specific protein sets that are to be detected. Detection reagents of a given diagnostic panel may detect proteins from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 or more organ specific protein sets such as those provided in Tables 1 32 36 45 and 47 79 or normal serum organ specific protein sets thereof.

Organ specific proteins can be detected and measured using any of a variety of detection reagents in the context of a variety of methods for measuring protein levels. Any detection reagent that can specifically bind to or otherwise detect an organ specific protein as described herein is contemplated as a suitable detection reagent. Illustrative detection reagents include but are not limited to antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof yeast ScFv DNA or RNA aptamers isotope labeled peptides receptors ligands click reagents molecular beacons quantum dots microfluidic nanotechnology measurement devices and the like.

In one illustrative embodiment a detection reagent is an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof. Methods of producing polyclonal antibodies are well known to those skilled in the art. Exemplary protocols which may be used are described for example in Coligan et al. Current Protocols In Immunology John Wiley Sons Inc 1991 and subsequent updates . Monoclonal antibodies may be produced using the standard method as described for example by K hler and Milstein 1975256 495 497 or by more recent modifications thereof as described for example in Coligan et al. 1991 supra by immortalizing spleen or other antibody producing cells derived from a production species which has been inoculated with an organ specific protein of the invention. In general antibodies can be produced by cell culture techniques including the generation of monoclonal antibodies as described herein or via transfection of antibody genes into suitable bacterial or mammalian cell hosts in order to allow for the production of recombinant antibodies. In one technique an immunogen comprising the polypeptide is initially injected into any of a wide variety of mammals e.g. mice rats rabbits chicken sheep or goats . In this step the polypeptides of this invention may serve as the immunogen without modification. Alternatively particularly for relatively short polypeptides a superior immune response may be elicited if the polypeptide is joined to a carrier protein such as bovine serum albumin or keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The immunogen is injected into the animal host usually according to a predetermined schedule incorporating one or more booster immunizations and the animals are bled periodically. Polyclonal antibodies specific for the polypeptide may then be purified from such antisera by for example affinity chromatography using the polypeptide coupled to a suitable solid support.

In one embodiment multiple target proteins or peptides are used in a single immune response to generate multiple useful detection reagents simultaneously. In one embodiment the individual specificities are later separated out.

In certain embodiments antibody can be generated by phage display methods such as described by Vaughan T. J. et al. 14 309 314 1996 and Knappik A. et al. 296 57 86 2000 ribosomal display such as described in Hanes J. et al. 18 1287 1292 2000 or periplasmic expression in see e.g. Chen G. et al. 19 537 542 2001. . In further embodiments antibodies can be isolated using a yeast surface display library. See e.g. nonimmune library of 10human antibody scFv fragments as constructed by Feldhaus M. J. et al. 21 163 170 2003. There are several advantages of this yeast surface display compared to more traditional large nonimmune human antibody repertoires such as phage display ribosomal display and periplasmic expression in 1 . The yeast library can be amplified 10 fold without measurable loss of clonal diversity and repertoire bias as the expression is under control of the tightly GAL1 10 promoter and expansion can be done under non induction conditions 2 nanomolar affinity scFvs can be routinely obtained by magnetic bead screening and flow cytometric sorting thus greatly simplified the protocol and capacity of antibody screening 3 with equilibrium screening a minimal affinity threshold of the antibodies desired can be set 4 the binding properties of the antibodies can be quantified directly on the yeast surface 5 multiplex library screening against multiple antigens simultaneously is possible and 6 for applications demanding picomolar affinity e.g. in early diagnosis subsequent rapid affinity maturation Kieke M. C. et al. 307 1305 1315 2001. can be carried out directly on yeast clones without further re cloning and manipulations.

Monoclonal antibodies specific for an organ specific polypeptide of interest may be prepared for example using the technique of Kohler and Milstein 6 511 519 1976 and improvements thereto. Briefly these methods involve the preparation of immortal cell lines capable of producing antibodies having the desired specificity i.e. reactivity with the polypeptide of interest . Such cell lines may be produced for example from spleen cells obtained from an animal immunized as described above. The spleen cells are then immortalized by for example fusion with a myeloma cell fusion partner in certain embodiments one that is syngeneic with the immunized animal. A variety of fusion techniques may be employed. For example the spleen cells and myeloma cells may be combined with a nonionic detergent for a few minutes and then plated at low density on a selective medium that supports the growth of hybrid cells but not myeloma cells. An illustrative selection technique uses HAT hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine selection. After a sufficient time usually about 1 to 2 weeks colonies of hybrids are observed. Single colonies are selected and their culture supernatants tested for binding activity against the polypeptide. Hybridomas having high reactivity and specificity are preferred.

Monoclonal antibodies may be isolated from the supernatants of growing hybridoma colonies. In addition various techniques may be employed to enhance the yield such as injection of the hybridoma cell line into the peritoneal cavity of a suitable vertebrate host such as a mouse. Monoclonal antibodies may then be harvested from the ascites fluid or the blood. Contaminants may be removed from the antibodies by conventional techniques such as chromatography gel filtration precipitation and extraction. The polypeptides of this invention may be used in the purification process in for example an affinity chromatography step.

A number of diagnostically useful molecules are known in the art which comprise antigen binding sites that are capable of exhibiting immunological binding properties of an antibody molecule. The proteolytic enzyme papain preferentially cleaves IgG molecules to yield several fragments two of which the F ab fragments each comprise a covalent heterodimer that includes an intact antigen binding site. The enzyme pepsin is able to cleave IgG molecules to provide several fragments including the F ab fragment which comprises both antigen binding sites. An Fv fragment can be produced by preferential proteolytic cleavage of an IgM and on rare occasions IgG or IgA immunoglobulin molecule. Fv fragments are however more commonly derived using recombinant techniques known in the art. The Fv fragment includes a non covalent V Vheterodimer including an antigen binding site which retains much of the antigen recognition and binding capabilities of the native antibody molecule. Inbar at al. 1972 69 2659 2662 Hochman et al. 1976 15 2706 2710 and Ehrlich et al. 1980 19 4091 4096.

A single chain Fv sFv polypeptide is a covalently linked V Vheterodimer which is expressed from a gene fusion including V and V encoding genes linked by a peptide encoding linker. Huston et al. 1988 85 16 5879 5883. A number of methods have been described to discern chemical structures for converting the naturally aggregated but chemically separated light and heavy polypeptide chains from an antibody V region into an sFv molecule which will fold into a three dimensional structure substantially similar to the structure of an antigen binding site. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 091 513 and 5 132 405 to Huston et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 to Ladner et al.

Each of the above described molecules includes a heavy chain and a light chain CDR set respectively interposed between a heavy chain and a light chain FR set which provide support to the CDRS and define the spatial relationship of the CDRs relative to each other. As used herein the term CDR set refers to the three hypervariable regions of a heavy or light chain V region. Proceeding from the N terminus of a heavy or light chain these regions are denoted as CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 respectively. An antigen binding site therefore includes six CDRs comprising the CDR set from each of a heavy and a light chain V region. A polypeptide comprising a single CDR e.g. a CDR1 CDR2 or CDR3 is referred to herein as a molecular recognition unit. Crystallographic analysis of a number of antigen antibody complexes has demonstrated that the amino acid residues of CDRs form extensive contact with bound antigen wherein the most extensive antigen contact is with the heavy chain CDR3. Thus the molecular recognition units are primarily responsible for the specificity of an antigen binding site.

As used herein the term FR set refers to the four flanking amino acid sequences which frame the CDRs of a CDR set of a heavy or light chain V region. Some FR residues may contact bound antigen however FRs are primarily responsible for folding the V region into the antigen binding site particularly the FR residues directly adjacent to the CDRS. Within FRs certain amino residues and certain structural features are very highly conserved. In this regard all V region sequences contain an internal disulfide loop of around 90 amino acid residues. When the V regions fold into a binding site the CDRs are displayed as projecting loop motifs which form an antigen binding surface. It is generally recognized that there are conserved structural regions of FRs which influence the folded shape of the CDR loops into certain canonical structures regardless of the precise CDR amino acid sequence. Further certain FR residues are known to participate in non covalent interdomain contacts which stabilize the interaction of the antibody heavy and light chains.

In one embodiment the detection reagents such as antibodies or aptamers are arrayed on a chip comprised of electronically activated copolymers of a conductive polymer and the detection reagent. Such arrays are known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 837 859 issued Nov. 17 1998 PCT publication WO 94 22889 dated Oct. 13 1994 . The arrayed pattern may be computer generated and stored. The chips may be prepared in advance and stored appropriately. The antibody array chips can be regenerated and used repeatedly.

In certain embodiments detection with multiple specific detection reagents is carried out in solution.

In certain embodiments the detection reagents for a diagnostic panel are selected such that the level of at least one of the organ specific proteins detected by the plurality of detection reagents in a blood sample from a subject afflicted with a disease affecting the organ or organs from which the organ specific proteins are derived is above or below a predetermined normal range. In certain embodiments the detection reagents for a diagnostic panel are selected such that the level of at least two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty forty one forty two forty three forty four forty five forty six forty seven forty eight forty nine fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety one hundred or more of the organ specific proteins detected by the plurality of detection reagents in a biological sample e.g. blood from a subject afflicted with a disease affecting the organ or organs from which the organ specific proteins are derived is above or below a predetermined normal range. Thus the detection reagents for a diagnostic panel kit or array may be selected such that the level of at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween or more of the organ specific proteins detected by the plurality of detection reagents in a blood sample from a subject afflicted with a disease affecting the organ or organs from which the organ specific proteins are derived is above or below a predetermined normal range.

The levels and locations of organ specific proteins may change as the result of disease. Thus in certain embodiments in vivo imaging techniques can be used to visualize the levels and locations of organ specific proteins in bodily fluid. In this embodiment exemplary in vivo imaging techniques include but are not limited to PET SPECT Sharma et al 2002 16 336 351 MALDI Stoeckli et al. 2001 7 493 496 and Fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET Seker et al 160 5 2003 629 633 .

The present invention provides organ specific protein and transcript sets and normal serum organ specific protein and transcript sets panels thereof reagents and probes directed thereto and methods for use and identifying the same. The present invention further provides panels arrays mixtures and kits comprising detection reagents or probes for detecting such organ specific proteins or polynucleotides that encode them in blood other bodily fluid and tissue samples such as biopsy samples from diseased organs.

It should also be understood that the blood protein and transcript fingerprints constitute assays for the normal organ and all the diseases of the organ. Thus all different diseases affecting such organ either directly or indirectly may be detected or monitored because each different type of disease arises from distinct disease perturbed networks that change the levels of different combinations of proteins whose synthesis they control. The present invention is not claiming disease specific proteins rather the fingerprints report the organ status for all different normal and disease organ conditions.

The present invention further provides methods of identifying new drug targets for a disease or indication by detecting specific up regulation of a transcript or polypeptide in a diseased state. In addition the present invention contemplates using such targets for imaging or drug targeting such that a probe to a disease specific protein or transcript may be utilized alone as a targeting agent or coupled to another therapeutic or diagnostic imaging agent.

The present invention also provides defined normal and disease associated organ specific blood fingerprints. As such the present invention provides methods of detecting diseases or following disease progression. The invention further provides methods for stratifying disease types and for monitoring the progression of a disease. The present invention also provides for following responses to therapy stratifying or qualifying patients for therapy or a clinical trial in a variety of disease settings and methods for detecting the disease state in humans using the visualization of nanoparticles with appropriate reporter groups and organ specific antibodies or aptamers.

The present invention can be used as a standard screening test. In this regard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween or more of the detection reagents specific for the organ specific proteins described herein can be used to measure the level of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween or more organ specific proteins in a blood sample and any statistically significant deviation from a normal serum organ specific blood fingerprint would indicate that disease related perturbation was present. Thus the present invention provides a normal organ specific blood fingerprint for any given organ. In certain embodiments a normal organ specific blood fingerprint is determined by measuring the normal range of levels of the individual protein members of a fingerprint. Any deviation therefrom or perturbation of the normal fingerprint that is outside the standard deviation normal range has diagnostic utility see also U.S. Patent Application No. 0020095259 . As would be recognized by the skilled artisan the significance of any deviation in the levels of e.g. a significantly altered level of one or more of the individual protein members of a fingerprint can be determined using statistical methods known in the art and described herein. As noted elsewhere herein perturbation of the normal fingerprint can indicate primary disease of the organ being tested or secondary indirect affects on that organ resulting from disease of another organ. Perturbation from normal may also include the presence of a protein in a sample of a patient being tested for a perturbed state not present in organ specific panel e.g. when analyzing a certain patient sample such as in the prostate a protein or transcript not found in the normal prostate panel may appear in a perturbed sample may be an indicator of disease. Further the absence of a protein or transcript found in the normal organ specific panel may also be an indicator of a perturbed state.

In an additional embodiment the present invention can be used to determine distinct normal organ specific blood fingerprints such as in different populations of people. In this regard distinct normal patterns of organ specific blood fingerprints may have differences in populations of patients that permit one to stratify patients into classes that would respond to a particular therapeutic regimen and those which would not.

In a further embodiment the present invention can be used to determine the risk of developing a particular biological condition. A statistically significant alteration e.g. increase or decrease in the levels of one or more members of a particular blood fingerprint may signify a risk of developing a particular disease such as a cancer an autoimmune disease or other biological condition.

To monitor the progression of a disease or monitor responses to therapy one or more organ specific blood fingerprints are detected measured as described herein using any of the methods as described herein at one time point and detected measured again at subsequent time points thereby monitoring disease progression or responses to therapy.

The normal organ specific blood fingerprints of the present invention can be used as a baseline for detecting any of a variety of diseases or the lack thereof . In certain embodiments the organ specific blood fingerprints of the present invention can be used to detect cancer. As such the present invention can be used to detect monitor progression of or monitor therapeutic regimens for any cancer including brain cancer melanoma non Hodgkin s lymphoma Hodgkin s disease leukemias plasmocytomas sarcomas adenomas gliomas thymomas breast cancer prostate cancer colo rectal cancer kidney cancer renal cell carcinoma uterine cancer pancreatic cancer esophageal cancer brain cancer lung cancer ovarian cancer cervical cancer testicular cancer gastric cancer multiple myeloma hepatoma acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL acute myelogenous leukemia AML chronic myelogenous leukemia CML and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL or other cancers. In addition for the white blood cell cancers cell sorting can optionally take place so that only analysis of white blood cells is carried out and thus direct analysis of the organ specific proteins or transcripts from the cells that have been specifically sorted will be accomplished. Moreover it should be understood that any condition such as a chronic disease to cancer to infectious diseases may change the blood immune cells in specific ways that will be revealed by organ specific or cell type specific analyses.

In certain embodiments the organ specific blood fingerprints of the present invention can be used to detect to monitor progression of or monitor therapeutic regimens for diseases of the heart kidney ureter bladder urethra liver prostate heart blood vessels bone marrow skeletal muscle smooth muscle various specific regions of the brain including but not limited to the amygdala caudate nucleus cerebellum corpus callosum fetal hypothalamus thalamus spinal cord peripheral nerves retina nose trachea lungs mouth salivary gland esophagus stomach small intestines large intestines hypothalamus pituitary thyroid pancreas adrenal glands ovaries oviducts uterus placenta vagina mammary glands testes seminal vesicles penis lymph nodes thymus and spleen. The present invention can be used to detect to monitor progression of or monitor therapeutic regimens for cardiovascular diseases neurological diseases metabolic diseases respiratory diseases autoimmune disease and lung diseases. As would be recognized by the skilled artisan the present invention can be used to detect monitor the progression of or monitor treatment for virtually any disease wherein the disease causes perturbation in organ specific proteins.

In certain embodiments the organ specific blood fingerprints of the present invention can be used to detect autoimmune disease. As such the present invention can be used to detect monitor progression of or monitor therapeutic regimens for autoimmune diseases such as but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis insulin dependent diabetes Addisons disease celiac disease chronic fatigue syndrome inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis Crohn s disease Fibromyalgia systemic lupus erythematosus psoriasis Sjogren s syndrome hyperthyroidism Graves disease hypothyroidism Hashimoto s disease Insulin dependent diabetes type 1 Myasthenia Gravis endometriosis scleroderma pernicious anemia Goodpasture syndrome Wegener s disease glomerulonephritis aplastic anemia paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria myelodysplastic syndrome idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura autoimmune hemolytic anemia Evans syndrome Factor VIII inhibitor syndrome systemic vasculitis dermatomyositis polymyositis and rheumatic fever.

In certain embodiments the organ specific blood fingerprints of the present invention can be used to detect diseases associated with infections with any of a variety of infectious organisms such as viruses bacteria parasites and fungi. Infectious organisms may comprise viruses e.g. RNA viruses DNA viruses human immunodeficiency virus HIV hepatitis A B and C virus herpes simplex virus HSV cytomegalovirus CMV Epstein Barr virus EBV human papilloma virus HPV parasites e.g. protozoan and metazoan pathogens such as species species species species bacteria e.g. in particular fungi e.g. species species and prions.

The diagnostic panels and generally methods used for detecting normal serum organ specific proteins can be used to define identify disease associated organ specific blood fingerprints. A disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint is a data set comprising the determined level in a blood sample from an individual afflicted with a disease of one or more components of a normal serum organ specific protein set that demonstrates a statistically significant change as compared to the determined normal level e.g. wherein the level in the disease sample is above or below a predetermined normal range . The data set is compiled from samples from individuals who are determined to have a particular disease using established medical diagnostics for the particular disease. The determined blood serum level of each protein member of a normal serum organ specific protein set as measured in the blood of the diseased sample is compared to the corresponding predetermined normal level. A statistically significant variation from the predetermined normal level for one or more members of the normal serum organ specific protein set provides diagnostically useful information disease associated fingerprint for that disease. Note that it may be determined for a particular disease or disease state that the level of only a few members of the normal serum organ specific protein set change relative to the normal levels. Thus a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint may comprise the determined levels in the blood of only a subset of the components of a normal serum organ specific protein set for a given organ and a particular disease. Thus a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels in blood of N members of a serum organ specific protein set wherein N is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween or more members up to the total number of members in a given serum organ specific protein set. In this regard in certain embodiments a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels of one or more components of a normal serum organ specific protein set. In one embodiment a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels in a sample from an individual known to have a particular disease of at least two components of a normal serum organ specific protein set. In other embodiments a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels in a sample from an individual known to have a particular disease of at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween components of a normal serum organ specific protein set.

In certain embodiments a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined level in the blood of components from multiple organs. As noted elsewhere in certain embodiments a disease can impact multiple organs with the result being a change in blood level of proteins from more than one organ specific protein set. Therefore in certain embodiments a disease associated organ specific fingerprint comprises the determined level in the blood of components from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween or more organ specific protein sets.

It should be noted that in certain embodiments a disease associated organ specific fingerprint will comprise the determined level of one or more components of a normal organ specific protein set that are NOT components of the corresponding normal organ specific protein set. Thus in this regard a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint may comprise the determined level of one or more components of a normal organ specific protein set. Further in certain embodiments a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint comprises the determined levels of one or more components of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween or more normal serum organ specific protein sets. Thus in this regard a disease associated organ specific blood fingerprint may comprise the determined levels of one or more components from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 or any integer value therebetween or more normal serum organ specific protein sets.

One of ordinary skill in the art could readily conclude that the present invention is useful in defining the normal parameters for any number of organs in the body. To that end the present invention may also be used to define subclinical perturbations from normal during annual screenings that could be utilized to initiate therapy or more aggressive examinations at an earlier date. Further defining normal for two three or more related organs can be accomplished by the present invention. Such groupings would be clear to those of skill in the art and could be any of a variety include those related to cardiovascular health including the heart lungs liver etc. As well as looking at groupings of liver and blood for infectious and parasitic diseases such as malaria HIV etc.

Using the diagnostic panels and methods described herein a vast array of disease associated organ specific blood fingerprints can be defined for any of a variety of diseases as described further herein. As such the present invention further provides information databases comprising data that make up blood fingerprints as described herein. As such the databases may comprise the defined differential expression levels as determined using any of a variety of methods such as those described herein of each of the plurality of organ specific proteins that make up a given fingerprint in any of a variety of settings e.g. normal or disease fingerprints .

The antibodies and oligopeptides employed in the methods of the present invention may optionally be produced in CHO cells or bacterial cells.

In one embodiment the present invention provides anti organ specific antibodies which may find use herein as therapeutic diagnostic and or imaging agents. Exemplary antibodies include polyclonal monoclonal humanized bispecific and heteroconjugate antibodies.

Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen especially when synthetic peptides are used to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized. For example the antigen can be conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent e.g. maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester conjugation through cysteine residues N hydroxysuccinimide through lysine residues glutaraldehyde succinic anhydride SOCl or RN C NR where R and Rare different alkyl groups.

Animals are immunized against the antigen immunogenic conjugates or derivatives by combining e.g. 100 g or 5 g of the protein or conjugate for rabbits or mice respectively with 3 volumes of Freund s complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with to 1 10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund s complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.

Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. Nature 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized as described above to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding Monoclonal Antibodies Principles and Practice pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium which medium preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells also referred to as fusion partner . For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred fusion partner myelomacells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 and derivatives e.g. X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor J. Immunol. 133 3001 1984 and Brodeur et al. Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al. Anal. Biochem. 107 220 1980 .

Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity are identified the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding Monoclonal Antibodies Principles and Practice pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g. by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as for example affinity chromatography e.g. using protein A or protein G Sepharose or ion exchange chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis etc.

DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al. Curr. Opinion in Immunol. 5 256 262 1993 and Pluckthun Immunol. Revs. 130 151 188 1992 .

In a further embodiment monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. Nature 348 552 554 1990 . Ctackson et al. Nature 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597 1991 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies respectively using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity nM range human antibodies by chain shuffling Marks et al. Bio Technology 10 779 783 1992 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al. Nuc. Acids. Res. 21 2265 2266 1993 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.

The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or fusion antibody polypeptides for example by substituting human heavy chain and light chain constant domain C.sub.H and C.sub.L sequences for the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 6851 1984 or by fusing the immunoglobulin coding sequence with all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide heterologous polypeptide . The non immunoglobulin polypeptide sequences can substitute for the constant domains of an antibody or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen combining site having specificity for a different antigen.

The anti organ specific antibodies of the invention may further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof such as Fv Fab Fab F ab or other antigen binding subsequences of antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a complementary determining region CDR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat or rabbit having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 329 1988 and Presta Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 1992 .

Methods for humanizing non human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. Science 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity and HAMA response human anti mouse antibody when the antibody is intended for human therapeutic use. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human V domain sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is identified and the human framework region FR within it accepted for the humanized antibody Sims et al. J. Immunol. 151 2296 1993 Chothia et al. J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 1987 . Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. J. Immunol. 151 2623 1993 .

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high binding affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to a preferred method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

Various forms of a humanized anti organ specific antibody are contemplated. For example the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment such as a Fab which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent s in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody such as an intact IgG1 antibody.

As an alternative to humanization human antibodies can be generated. For example it is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region J.sub.H gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. Nature 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. Year in Immuno. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 591 669 all of GenPharm U.S. Pat. No. 5 545 807 and WO 97 17852.

Alternatively phage display technology McCafferty et al. Nature 348 552 553 can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single stranded DNA copy of the phage genome selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats reviewed in e.g. Johnson Kevin S and Chiswell David J. Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3 564 571 1993 . Several sources of V gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. Nature 352 624 628 1991 isolated a diverse array of anti oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of probes including self antigens can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597 1991 or Griffith et al. EMBO J. 12 725 734 1993 . See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 565 332 and 5 573 905.

As discussed above human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 567 610 and 5 229 275 .

In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. Science 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. Bio Technology 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 894 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 587 458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See Antibody Engineering ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of an organ specific protein as described herein. Other such antibodies may combine an organ specific binding site with a binding site for another protein. Alternatively an anti organ specific arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R such as Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD16 so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the organ specific expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used for diagnostic purposes attaching imaging agents or localizing cytotoxic agents to cells which express organ specific transcripts and or polypeptides. These antibodies possess an organ specific binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon .alpha. vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

WO 96 16673 describes a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5 837 234 discloses a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RI antibody. A bispecific anti ErbB2 Fc.alpha. antibody is shown in WO98 02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 teaches a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti CD3 antibody.

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Millstein et al. Nature 305 537 539 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. EMBO J. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge C and Cregions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region C containing the site necessary for light chain bonding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant affect on the yield of the desired chain combination.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. Methods in Enzymology 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168 the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C.sub.H3 domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. Science 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. J. Exp. Med. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets. Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. J. Immunol. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a V.sub.H connected to a V.sub.L by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the V.sub.H and V.sub.L domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary V.sub.L and V.sub.H domains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. J. Immunol. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. J. Immunol. 147 60 1991 .

Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 EP 03089 . It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry including those involving crosslinking agents. For example immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl 4 mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980.

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fc region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises or consists of three to about eight but preferably four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain and preferably two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 .sub.n VD2 X2 .sub.n Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two and preferably four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function e.g. so as to enhance antigen dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al. J. Exp Med. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. J. Immunol. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. Cancer Research 53 2560 2565 1993 . Alternatively an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. Anti Cancer Drug Design 3 219 230 1989 . To increase the serum half life of the antibody one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody especially an antibody fragment as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 739 277 for example. As used herein the term salvage receptor binding epitope refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule e.g. IgG.sub.1 IgG IgG.sub.3 or IgG.sub.4 that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half life of the IgG molecule.

The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include 12Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as tolyene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids a trichothene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

The anti organ specific antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 3688 1985 Hwang et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 4030 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545 and WO97 38731 published Oct. 23 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556.

Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. J. Biol. Chem. 257 286 288 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. J. National Cancer Inst. 81 19 1484 1989 .

Organ specific binding oligopeptides of the present invention are oligopeptides that bind preferably specifically to an organ specific polypeptide as described herein. organ specific binding oligopeptides may be chemically synthesized using known oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using recombinanttechnology. organ specific binding oligopeptides are usually at least about 5 amino acids in length alternatively at least about 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 amino acids in length or more wherein such oligopeptides that are capable of binding preferably specifically to an organ specific polypeptide as described herein. organ specific binding oligopeptides may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this regard it is noted that techniques for screening oligopeptide libraries for oligopeptides that are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 556 762 5 750 373 4 708 871 4 833 092 5 223 409 5 403 484 5 571 689 5 663 143 PCT Publication Nos. WO 84 03506 and WO084 03564 Geysen et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this regard bacteriophage phage display is one well known technique which allows one to screen large oligopeptide libraries to identify member s of those libraries which are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target. Phage display is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to the coat protein on the surface of bacteriophage particles Scott J. K. and Smith G. P. 1990 Science 249 386 . The utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of selectively randomized protein variants or randomly cloned cDNAs can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Display of peptide Cwirla S. E. et al. 1990 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 6378 or protein Lowman H. B. et al. 1991 Biochemistry 30 10832 Clackson T. et al. 1991 Nature 352 624 Marks J.

USA 88 8363 libraries on phage have been used for screening millions of polypeptides or oligopeptides for ones with specific binding properties Smith G. P. 1991 Current Opin. Biotechnol. 2 668 .

Many other improvements and variations of the basic phage display concept have now been developed. These improvements enhance the ability of display systems to screen peptide libraries for binding to selected target molecules and to display functional proteins with the potential of screening these proteins for desired properties. Combinatorial reaction devices for phage display reactions have been developed WO 98 14277 and phage display libraries have been used to analyze and control bimolecular interactions WO 98 20169 WO 98 20159 and properties of constrained helical peptides WO 98 20036 . WO 97 35196 describes a method of isolating an affinity ligand in which a phage display library is contacted with one solution in which the ligand will bind to a target molecule and a second solution in which the affinity ligand will not bind to the target molecule to selectively isolate binding ligands. WO 97 46251 describes a method of biopanning a random phage display library with an affinity purified antibody and then isolating binding phage followed by a micropanning process using microplate wells to isolate high affinity binding phage. The use of protein A as an affinity tag has also been reported Li et al. 1998 Mol. Biotech. 9 187 . WO 97 47314 describes the use of substrate subtraction libraries to distinguish enzyme specificities using a combinatorial library which may be a phage display library. A method for selecting enzymes suitable for use in detergents using phage display is described in WO 97 09446. Additional methods of selecting specific binding proteins are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 498 538 5 432 018 and WO 98 15833.

Organ specific binding organic molecules are organic molecules other than oligopeptides or antibodies as defined herein that bind preferably specifically to an organ specific polypeptide as described herein. organ specific binding organic molecules may be identified and chemically synthesized using known methodology see e.g. PCT Publication Nos. WO00 00823 and WO00 39585 . organ specific binding organic molecules are usually less than about 2000 daltons in size alternatively less than about 1500 750 500 250 or 200 daltons in size wherein such organic molecules that are capable of binding preferably specifically to an organ specific polypeptide as described herein may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this regard it is noted that techniques for screening organic molecule libraries for molecules that are capable of binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art see e.g. PCT Publication Nos.

D. Screening for Anti Organ Specific Antibodies Organ Specific Binding Oligopeptides and Organ Specific Binding Organic Molecules with the Desired Properties

Techniques for generating antibodies oligopeptides and organic molecules that bind to organ specific polypeptides have been described above. One may further select antibodies oligopeptides or other organic molecules with certain biological characteristics as desired.

The growth inhibitory effects of an anti organ specific antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule of the invention may be assessed by methods known in the art e.g. using cells which express an organ specific polypeptide either endogenously or following transfection with the organ specific gene. For example appropriate tumor cell lines and organ specific transfected cells may treated with an anti organ specific monoclonal antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule of the invention at various concentrations for a few days e.g. 2 7 days and stained with crystal violet or MTT or analyzed by some other colorimetric assay. Another method of measuring proliferation would be by comparing H thymidine uptake by the cells treated in the presence or absence an anti organ specific antibody organ specific binding oligopeptide or organ specific binding organic molecule of the invention. After treatment the cells are harvested and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the DNA quantitated in a scintillation counter. Appropriate positive controls include treatment of a selected cell line with a growth inhibitory antibody known to inhibit growth of that cell line. Growth inhibition of tumor cells in vivo can be determined in various ways known in the art. Preferably the tumor cell is one that overexpresses an organ specific polypeptide. Preferably the anti organ specific antibody organ specific binding oligopeptide or organ specific binding organic molecule will inhibit cell proliferation of an organ specific expressing tumor cell in vitro or in vivo by about 25 100 compared to the untreated tumor cell more preferably by about 30 100 and even more preferably by about 50 100 or 70 100 in one embodiment at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml. Growth inhibition can be measured at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml or about 0.5 nM to 200 nM in cell culture where the growth inhibition is determined 1 10 days after exposure of the tumor cells to the antibody. The antibody is growth inhibitory in vivo if administration of the anti organ specific antibody at about 1 g kg to about 100 mg kg body weight results in reduction in tumor size or reduction of tumor cell proliferation within about 5 days to 3 months from the first administration of the antibody preferably within about 5 to 30 days.

To select for an anti organ specific antibody organ specific binding oligopeptide or organ specific binding organic molecule which induces cell death loss of membrane integrity as indicated by e.g. propidium iodide PI trypan blue or 7AAD uptake may be assessed relative to control. A PI uptake assay can be performed in the absence of complement and immune effector cells. organ specific polypeptide expressing tumor cells are incubated with medium alone or medium containing the appropriate anti organ specific antibody e.g. at about 10 g ml organ specific binding oligopeptide or organ specific binding organic molecule. The cells are incubated for a 3 day time period. Following each treatment cells are washed and aliquoted into 35 mm strainer capped 12 75 tubes 1 ml per tube 3 tubes per treatment group for removal of cell clumps. Tubes then receive PI 1 g ml . Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN . flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT . CellQuest software Becton Dickinson . Those anti organ specific antibodies organ specific binding oligopeptides or organ specific binding organic molecules that induce statistically significant levels of cell death as determined by PI uptake may be selected as cell death inducing anti organ specific antibodies organ specific binding oligopeptides or organ specific binding organic molecules.

To screen for antibodies oligopeptides or other organic molecules which bind to an epitope on an organ specific polypeptide bound by an antibody of interest a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed. This assay can be used to determine if a test antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule binds the same site or epitope as a known anti organ specific antibody. Alternatively or additionally epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art. For example the antibody sequence can be mutagenized such as by alanine scanning to identify contact residues. The mutant antibody is initially tested for binding with polyclonal antibody to ensure proper folding. In a different method peptides corresponding to different regions of an organ specific polypeptide can be used in competition assays with the test antibodies or with a test antibody and an antibody with a characterized or known epitope.

Other methods of using the present panels sets and individual members of the panels noted herein includes the use for evaluation of test compounds in a biological system to monitor changes related thereto. As one of skill in the art could readily appreciate when observing a disease related profile a test compound that changes said profile to be more similar to the normal profile is of significant interest as a drug lead. Accordingly the present invention also provides a method for optimizing drug test compound leads by treating an animal cell or tissue with said compound and observing whether the organ cell or tissue specific profile changes to deviate from the diseased profile toward a more normal profile.

One aspect of the invention is a method for evaluating a test compound for biological activity comprising providing a database comprising a plurality of reference normal organ specific protein and or gene expression profiles each profile comprising a representation of the expression level of a plurality of genes or proteins in a test cell exposed to a reference compound and a representation of the reference compound providing a test expression profile comprising a representation of the expression level of a plurality of genes and or proteins in a test cell exposed to said test compound comparing said test expression profile with said first expression profiles identifying at least one first expression profile that is similar to said test expression profile displaying said selected expression profile.

Another aspect of the invention is a computer readable medium having encoded thereon a set of instructions enabling a computer system to perform the method of the invention.

An additional aspect of the present invention provides a system comprising a correlative database that permits one to study relationships between different genes or polypeptides encoded thereby between genes or the polypeptides and a variety of compounds to investigate structure function relationships between different compounds. The database contains a plurality of standard gene expression or protein expression profiles of organ specific components or under a plurality of specified conditions. The conditions specified can include expression within a particular cell type for example fibroblast lymphocyte neuron oocyte hepatocyte and the like expression at a particular point in the cell cycle e.g. G1 expression in a specified disease state the presence of environmental factors for example temperature pressure COpartial pressure osmotic pressure shear stress confluency adherence and the like the presence of pathogenic organisms for example viruses bacterial fungi and extra or intracellular parasites expression in the presence of heterologous genes expression in the presence of test compounds and the like and combinations thereof. The database preferably comprises expression profiles for at least 10 different genes from specific to a particular organ or tissue. The standard expression profiles are preferably annotated for example with information regarding the conditions under which the profile was obtained. Preferably the database also contains annotations for one or more genes more preferably for each gene represented in the database. The annotations can include any available information about the gene such as for example the gene s or protein s names and synonyms the sequence any known biological activity or function any genes or proteins of similar sequence any metabolic or protein interaction pathways to which it is known to belong and the like.

The database contains interpretive gene expression profiles and bioassay profiles for a plurality of different compounds that comprise a representation of a compound s mode of action and or toxicity drug signatures and can include experimental compounds and or standard compounds. Drug signatures provide a unique picture of a compound s comprehensive activity in vivo including both its effect on gene transcription and its interaction with proteins. Standard compounds are preferably well characterized and preferably exhibit a known biological effect on host cells and or organisms. Standard compounds can advantageously be selected from the class of available drug compounds natural toxins and venoms known poisons vitamins and nutrients metabolic byproducts and the like. The standard compounds can be selected to provide as a set a wide range of different gene expression profiles. The records for the standard compounds are preferably annotated with information available regarding the compounds such as for example the compound name structure and chemical formula molecular weight aqueous solubility pH lipophilicity known biological activity source proteins and or genes it is known to interact with assays for detecting and or confirming activity of the compound or related compounds and the like. Alternatively one can employ a database constructed from random compounds combinatorial libraries and the like.

The database further contains bioassay data derived from experiments in which one or more compounds represented in the database are examined for activity against one or more proteins represented in the database. Bioassay data can be obtained from open literature and directly by experiment.

The information is obtained by assimilation of and or reference to currently available databases and by collecting experimental data. It should be noted that the gene database although large contains a finite number of records limited by the number of genes in the organisms under study. The compound database is potentially unlimited as new compounds are made and tested constantly. The profile database however is still larger as it represents information regarding the interaction of a very large number of genes with a potentially infinite number of different compounds under a variety of conditions.

Experimental data is preferably collected using a high throughput assay format capable of examining for example the effects of a plurality of compounds preferably a large number of standard compounds for example 10 000 when administered individually or as a mixture to a plurality of different cell types. Assay data collected using a uniform format are more readily comparable and provide a more accurate indication of the differences between for example the activity of similar compounds or the differences in sensitivity of similar genes.

The system provides several different ways to access the information contained within the database. An operator can enter a test gene expression profile into the system cause the system to compare the test profile with stored standard gene expression profiles in the database and obtain an output comprising one or more standard expression profiles that are similar to the test profile. The standard expression profiles are preferably accompanied by annotations for example providing information to the operator as to the similarity of the test profile to standard profiles obtained from disease states and or standard compounds. The test gene expression profile preferably includes an indication of the conditions under which the profile is obtained for example a representation of a test compound used and or the culture conditions.

The output preferably further comprises a list of the organ specific genes proteins or transcripts that are modulated up regulated or down regulated in the test profile as compared with a pre established expression value a pre selected standard expression profile a second test expression profile or another pre set threshold value.

The output is preferably hyperlinked so that the operator can easily switch from for example a listing of the similar standard expression profiles to a listing of the modulated genes in a selected standard expression profile or from a gene listed in the test profile to a list of the standard expression profiles in which the gene is similarly modulated or to a list of the standard compounds and or conditions which appear to modulate the selected gene. The output can comprise correlation information that highlights features in common between different genes targets profiles compounds assays and the like to assist the user in drawing useful correlations. For example the output can contain a list of genes that were modulated in the user s experiment with a selected compound if a plurality of the genes are indicated as associated with liver toxicity the system can prompt the user that the compound is associated with a toxic drug signature and prompt the user to continue with the next compound. Conversely the output could indicate previously unnoticed associations between different pathways leading the user to explore a hitherto unknown connection. The output preferably includes hyperlinks to product information encouraging the user to purchase or order one or more products from a selected vendor where the product s relate specifically to the focus of the database inquiry and the correlation information that results and is presented back to the user to facilitate hypothesis generation. For example the output can provide links to products useful for confirming the apparent activity of a compound for measuring biological activity directly for assaying the compound for possible side effects and the like prompting the user to select products useful in the next stage of experimentation.

The system is preferably provided with an algorithm for assessing similarity of compounds. Suitable methods for comparing compounds and determining their morphological similarity include 3D MI as set forth in copending application U.S. Ser. No. 09 475 413 now U.S. Pat. No. 6 470 305 incorporated herein by reference in full Tanimoto similarity Daylight Software and the like. Preferably the system can be queried for any compounds that are similar to the test compound in structure and or morphology. The output from this query preferably includes the corresponding standard expression profiles or hyperlinks to the corresponding standard expression profiles and preferably further includes a listing description or hyperlink to an assay capable of determining the biological activity of the standard and or test compound.

Thus for example if the user inputs an experimental expression profile resulting from incubation of test cells with a particular experimental compound the user can obtain an output comprising an estimate of the quality of the data an identification of the genes affected by the compound a listing of similar profiles and the conditions under which they were obtained for example the compounds used and a list of compounds having a structural similarity. The output can be provided in a hyperlinked format that permits the user to then investigate and explore the data. For example the user can examine which genes are modulated and determine whether or not the genes have yet been characterized as to function or activity and under what conditions each gene is modulated in a similar fashion. Alternatively the user can compare the profile obtained with the profile of a desired outcome for example comparing the profile obtained by incubation of diseased or infected tissue with a test compound against a profile obtained from healthy unperturbed tissue. Alternatively the user can compare the profile with the profiles obtained using standard compounds for example using a drug of known activity mechanism of action and specificity thus determining whether the test compound operates by a different mechanism or if by the same mechanism whether it is more or less active than the standard. Additionally the user can compare the structure of the test compound with the structures of other compounds with similar profiles to determine which structural features of the compounds are common and thus likely to be important for activity or can compare the compound s profile with the profiles obtained from structurally similar compounds in general.

The system can be configured as a single integrated whole or can be distributed over a variety of locations. For example the system can be provided as a central database server with remotely located access units. The remote access units can be provided with sufficient system capability to accept and interpret test gene expression profiles and to compare the test profiles with standard gene expression profiles. Remote units can further be provided with a copy of some or all of the database information. Optionally the remote system can be used to upload test gene expression profiles to the central system to update the central database or a private database supplementary to the main database can be stored in or near the remote unit.

The normalized MPSS data used in this study was previously described Jongeneel et al. 2005 15 1007 1014 but re annotated by Solexa Hayward Calif. USA to the new UniGene database. The data contained a total of 391 669 MPSS sequence tags their gene annotation their expression levels in 32 different tissues as specified by their transcription per million tpm and the associated standard deviation SD and information on the sequence tags such as significance selected step class and global replication. This dataset was used to identify organ specific proteins as described below.

Assume the expression in tpm and the associated SD of a MPSS sequence tag in the 32 tissues were X where i 1 2 . . . 32 represents individual tissues. Assume the tag had the highest expression levels in tissue m where the expression and the SD were X . We then applied three rules to determine whether the tag was specific to tissue m as follows 

We then evaluated the significance that the expression of the tag in tissue m was above the expression of the tag in other tissues as

Nine different values of fand pwere applied in determining organ specific MPSS tags ranging from the most stringent condition f 1 and p 10 to the least stringent condition f 0.5 and p 0.1 See Tables 1 32 and 36 45. However in most cases we required that p 10. 10 

The stringency for each organ specific transcript is noted in Tables 1 32 and 36 45. see column marked Specificity 

When we applied rules i iii Eqs. 1 6 and 10 with f 0.8 to the 391 669 MPSS sequence tags we identified a total of 17 638 organ specific tags. The number of organ specific tags varies with the selected values of fand p See Tables 1 32 and 36 45.

MPSS tags were annotated to gene accession numbers in the UniGene database by Solexa. In cases where MPSS tags were mapped to multiple genes in the UniGene database Solexa intentionally annotated the MPSS tags only to genes having the longest sequences. A script was developed to annotate the MPSS tags to all genes containing the MPSS tags. A separate script was then developed to map gene accession numbers in the UniGene database to the corresponding gene accessions protein accessions and protein sequences in the RefSeq database web address ftp colon double slash ftp dot ncbi dot gov slash refseq slash . In this way organ specific tags were mapped to corresponding proteins. In some cases multiple MPSS tags may be mapped to the same proteins. In such cases only the MPSS tag having the most abundant expression was kept for each organ specific protein. The organ specific proteins identified are provided in Tables 1 32 and 36 45. Information on each protein includes gene name gene accession number protein accession number summary description of the protein predicted protein localization as described further below corresponding MPSS tag the class of the MPSS tag the expression of the tag in the particular tissue count the specificity of the tag in the particular tissue as described above and the number of peptides identified on the protein by HUPO as described further below . The amino acid sequences corresponding to the organ specific proteins and the polynucleotides encoding the proteins are provided in the sequence listing. Sequences corresponding to the MPSS tags as shown in Tables 1 32 and 36 45 are also provided Sequences corresponding to peptides previously identified by mass spectrometry that map to organ specific proteins described in Tables 43 44 and 45 are shown in those Tables and are provided in the sequence listing.

Protein sequences in the RefSeq database were used to predict protein localization using TMHMM server 2.0 http colon double slash www dot cbs dot dtu dot dk services TMHMM which applies hidden Markov model to predict protein transmembrane domains SignalP server 3.0 http colon double slash www dot cbs dot dtu dot dk services SignalP which applies both artificial neural network and hidden Markov model to predict the presence and the location of signal peptide cleavage sites for classical N terminus lead secreted proteins. This was performed computationally using a combination of hidden Markov model HMM algorithms Krogh et al. 2001 305 567 and transmembrane TM region predictions from a commercial version of the TMHMM algorithm. The subcellular localizations of proteins were categorized as follows a extracellular proteins including secreted proteins which contain predicted signal peptides and no predicted transmembrane segments c transmembrane proteins which contain predicted transmembrane segments or d other which includes intracellular proteins which contain neither predicted signal peptides nor predicted transmembrane regions was then used to combine the outputs of the two programs into protein localization prediction which is outlined in Table 33. The localization prediction for all organ specific proteins is summarized in Table 33.

The Plasma Proteome Project of the Human Proteome Organization HUPO released a list of human plasma proteins including the number of identified peptides on each protein Omenn et al. . 2005 3226 45 . These proteins were specified by protein IDs in the International Protein Index IPI database web address ftp colon double slash ftp dot ebi dot ac dot uk slash pub databases IPI current ipi dot HUMAN dot fasta dot gz . A list for mapping protein IPI IDs to protein RefSeq accession numbers was also provided. Overlap between the organ specific proteins and the HUPO plasma proteins were analyzed. The identified overlap is shown in Tables 1 32. Further classification by class and ranks were used to formulate statistical tests to determine significant genes Stolovitzky et al PNAS 2005 1402 1407 .

This experiment demonstrates the process of identifying organ specific proteins in a normal sample of blood serum from a healthy human volunteer. For normal control serum venous blood samples were drawn from a fasted human volunteer. Samples were collected with minimal stasis in evacuated serum separator tubes. After at least 30 min but within 2 hours the tubes were centrifuged at 23 C. for 15 minutes at 1 200 g and serum was stored in plastic vials at 80 C. To reduce sample complexity plasma was passed over a column containing antibodies to the most abundant proteins. In this example an affinity column was used to remove albumin IgG IgA anti trypsin transferrin and haptoglobin however affinity columns with an expanded repertoire could also be used. Since most proteins found on the cell surface or secreted from cells are glycoproteins and can be isolated via the glycopeptide capture method proteins were further enriched and identified by specifically capturing N linked glycopeptides from plasma.

A recently developed mass spectrometry based screening technology provided specific targets glycoproteins in a plasma sample for identification and quantification. The glycopeptides isolated from plasma and tissues were analyzed by MALDI TOF TOF ABI 4800 Proteomics Analyzer Applied Biosystems after front end separation of peptides using strong cation exchange fractionation followed by reversed phase chromatography. The advantage of this platform is its high mass accuracy resolution sensitivity and the ability to do targeted MS MS analysis on peptides of interest. Since the separation is performed off line more time is available for deeper interrogation of the observed tryptic peptides. Multiple plates can also be spotted and analyzed by MALDI TOF TOF to increase the depth of proteomic coverage. This platform will also be used in the direct follow up analysis of potential peptides during the comparison of cancer and control sera using heavy isotope labeled synthetic peptide standards.

Up to 20 g total peptide was loaded onto a 150 mm 0.3 mm poly sulfoethyl A column and peptides were eluted using five to ten steps of increasing salt concentration. Up to 2 g total peptide that was bumped from the strong cation exchange column was trapped onto a 250 micron 3 cm trap column self packed with 5 micron particle Vydac C8 208MS54 . The Eksigent HPLC and autosampler Model NanoLC 2D Dublin Calif. uses a 10 ul sample loop. After capturing the strong cation exchange eluate the trap column was brought in line with a 100 micron ID 20 cm resolving column that was self packed with 5 micron particle Vydac C18 218MS54 at a flow rate of 500 nanoliters per minute using 0.1 TFA and 2 acetonitrile as solvent A and 0.08 TFA and 80 acetonitrile as solvent B. Peptides were eluted using a 90 min gradient up to 75 solvent B. The effluent of the HPLC column enters a mixing tee where it combines with matrix solution flowing at 0.75 ul min prior to spotting to a MALDI plate at the rate of 25 seconds per spot. The matrix solution was 4 mg ml alpha cyano 4 hydroxycinnamic acid Aldrich in 70 acetonitrile 0.1 TFA containing 5 mM ammonium dihydrogen phosphate. The spots were placed in a 25 40 array where each HPLC gradient has 200 spots thus each Maldi plate can hold 5 reversed phase HPLC gradients.

The spotted plates contain 8 locations around the perimeter of the plate where an external calibrant was placed. The external calibrant was the 4700 mix Applied Biosystems prepared as directed. Upon insertion into the mass spectrometer the laser was aligned with the crosshairs of the sample viewer and the plate was aligned to the four corners of the 25 40 spot sample array. The mass spectrometer was tuned for sensitivity and resolution using the calibration spots and then an external calibration was obtained in MS and MSMS mode. Each HPLC gradient 200 spots was analyzed by acquiring an MS spectrum at each spot using 100 laser shots randomly located at 10 positions within each sample spot. Upon completion of the 200 MS spectra for each of the sample spots the data system determines the top 20 precursor ions per sample spot user selected variable precursor ions for subsequent acquisition of MS MS spectra. Alternatively specific precursor masses can be acquired regardless of their presence or absence in the MS spectra. Each MS MS spectra was obtained from 2000 laser shots from 20 random positions within each sample spot without using collision gas. Upon completion the MS MS spectra can be exported to the supplied database search engine Mascot for peptide protein identification. Analysis of the collected spectra led to the identification of approximately 150 unique proteins from plasma. When compared to the organ specific proteins summarized in Tables 1 32 it was shown that this dataset includes seven glycosylated tissue specific proteins. These seven proteins are listed in Table 34A and 34B.

Thus this example identifies numerous normal serum organ specific proteins Table 34A and 34B . These proteins are diagnostically useful in a variety of settings as described herein for example for defining a biological state of a subject and for the diagnosis of specific diseases.

Blood serum tests to detect and monitor proteins were developed using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA . The assay system utilized two antibodies directed against different antigenic regions of the candidate protein. A monoclonal antibody directed against a distinct antigenic determinant on the intact candidate protein was used for solid phase immobilization on the microtiter wells. A detection antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase HRP or fluorescence tag recognized the candidate protein within different region of the same protein. The candidate protein reacted simultaneously with the two antibodies resulting in the protein being sandwiched between the solid phase and detection antibody. The detection antibody was visualized by colorimetric fluorescence analysis.

In the case of peptides detected in blood the specific peptide was further enriched from peptide mixture isolated from plasma using the physico chemical properties of the peptide or affinity reagents developed for the peptide. Protein concentrations were estimated by an ELISA employing specific antibodies to capture and detect the protein of interest in serum. Wells of 96 well microtiter plates Maxisorp Nunc Roskilde Denmark were coated with protein specific antibodies and incubated overnight at 2 8 C. Well surfaces were saturated with a solution of irrelevant protein to prevent non specific binding of subsequent reactants and washed with Phosphate Buffered Saline PBS pH 7.2 with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST prior to use. Samples and reagents were dispensed into the wells in the following sequence each separated by an incubation period and wash step 1 serum samples and protein concentration standards 2 detection antibodies 3 horseradish peroxidase conjugate and 4 peroxidase substrate. The substrate reaction was stopped after a final incubation period with the addition of acid to the wells and the O.D.s were determined with a microplate spectrophotometer. Sample concentrations were then extrapolated from the dose response curve.

Current methods for prostate cancer screening include cancer screening with Prostate Specific Antigen PSA . The PSA test is not always predictive of prostate cancer due to individual patient risk factors including ethnicity family history as well as the patient s individual status and individual risk aversion to complications from prostate cancer. Since the PSA test is not entirely predictive future prostate cancer screening will need to incorporate new biomarkers to predict the risk of disease Thompson et al. . 2005 14 747 60 .

This example describes a multiparameter diagnostic fingerprint using STEAP2 a multiple transmembrane protein of the prostate as a biological marker. STEAP2 is the gene encoding a Human six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate STEAP2 . STEAP2 was previously shown to have prostate specific expression Porkka K P et al . 2002 82 1573 1582 Kormaz K S . 2002 27 36689 96 . Further as outlined in Example 1 and shown in Table 21 STEAP2 was shown to be a prostate specific protein using the methods outlined herein.

Commercially available antibodies specific for numerous proteins encoded by prostate specific genes see Table 21 were used to determine which proteins would be useful in a multiparameter diagnostic assay for prostate cancer. The antibody available for STEAP2 anti STEAP2 Cat A23080 Genway Biotech Inc. was shown to bind specifically to a fragment of STEAP2 from human serum. In this example TGM4 was used as a control. TGM4 is the gene encoding Human prostate specific transglutaminase hTGP . hTGP has prostate specific expression Dubbink et al 1998 51 434 444 . The antibody available for TGM4 anti TGM4 Cat G23082 Genway Biotech Inc. was shown to specifically bind to TGM4 from human serum.

Western blot analysis was used to measure serum protein expression as follows Serum was diluted 1 25 with sample buffer 50 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8 100 mM dithiothreitol 2 sodium dodecylsulphate 0.1 bromophenol blue 10 glycerol . Serum proteins in 4 A of 4 serum solution were analyzed with SDS PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane Hybond P Millipore Billerica Mass. . The membrane was blocked with 1 non fat dry milk in TBS T 25 mM Tris pH 7.4 125 mM NaCl 0.1 Tween 20 for 1 hour at room temperature followed by incubation with primary antibodies against STEAP2 1 5000 or TGM4 1 5000 for 1 h at room temperature 23 C. . The membranes were washed 3 times with TBS T and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti chicken antibodies 1 10 000 for 0.5 h. The immunoblot was then washed five times with TBS T and developed using enhanced chemoluminescence following the manufacturer s recommendation Pierce see . The densities of the single bands corresponding to STEAP2 and TGM4 were quantified using ImageJ software available at http colon double slash rsb dot info dot nih dot gov ij . The results are summarized in Table 35. PSA scores for each of the tested sera were obtained using a commercially available ELISA kit. For these prostate cancer patients the majority of samples showed PSA levels above what is considered the normal range 0 4 ng mL . STEAP2 levels also appeared elevated in many prostate cancer sera relative to sera from normal patients. However the combination of PSA and STEAP2 proved to be a better predictor of prostate cancer than PSA levels alone identifying cancer in three samples with normal PSA levels samples 7 9 10 and in one sample with only slightly elevated PSA levels sample 3 .

In summary the STEAP2 prostate specific protein further improved prostate cancer detection when used in combination with PSA see and Table 35 . Thus using the methods described herein a multiparameter diagnostic panel was developed comprising the STEAP2 prostate specific protein and PSA.

In further experiments normal healthy organ samples were obtained. For each organ total RNA was isolated from each tissue as follows Tissue 0.1 0.2 mgs from a specific organ was excised from frozen tissue and placed in 4 mL of TRIZOL Reagent Invitrogen U.S. Pat. No. 5 346 994 Chomczynski at al. 1987 162 156 . Each sample was quickly homogenized for up to 90 seconds at room temperature. The homogenate of tissue and TRIZOL Reagent was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Chloroform 800 uL was added to each sample and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Each sample was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4 C. The aqueous layer containing nucleic acids was collected and transferred to fresh tubes. Nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of 2 mL of 2 propanol and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The precipitate was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 minutes and nucleic acid pellets were collected. The supernatants were decanted and pellets washed with 2 mL of 70 ethanol and air dried. Pellets were suspended in 50 100 uL of RNase free water. The nucleic acid concentration was calculated using spectroscopy at wavelength 260 nm and purity was determined by calculating the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm in each sample. Total RNA was analyzed by microcapillary electrophoresis using a Bioanalyzer following the manufacturer s procedures Agilent 2100 . Briefly 1 uL of each RNA sample was diluted to 250 ng uL in water was loaded onto a nano CHIP and RNA profiles were visualized using a standard protocol provided by the manufacturer. The quality of the RNA was determined by examining the electrophoresis peaks and by determining the relative ratio of the 28X and 18S ribosomal RNA. This ratio was used as a metric to estimate the overall integrity of all other RNA species in the sample. Samples where the electrophoresis peaks and the 28S 18S ratio was greater than 1.5 were deemed acceptable for further transcript analyses.

This example shows a further refinement and the identification of organ specific protein sets for prostate and testes in the male and mammary gland and uterus in the female.

The normalized MPSS dataset described in Example 1 was further refined to elicit nucleotide and protein sequences which were specific to various male or female organs. To that end the data from the thirty two tissues described therein were delineated further to identify sequences specific to male prostate Table 36 and testes Table 37 and female mammary gland Table 38 and uterus Table 39 .

Refinement procedure to identify the organ specific MPSS sequences required examining the tissue specific sequences of the thirty two tissues and subtracting the tissues specific for females in this case mammary gland and uterus in order to fully examine those sequences specific to male organs listed particularly testes and prostate . Similarly in order to examine organ specific sequences which relate specifically to female organs subtraction of the prostate and testes sequences from the thirty two tissues was performed.

Briefly to identify nucleotide and protein sequences that were specific to male organs prostate and testis MPSS data of mammary gland and uterus were first removed from MPSS dataset of the thirty two tissues. MPSS data of the remaining thirty tissues were then used to identify organ specific MPSS sequences using the procedure described in Example 1. MPSS sequences that were specific to prostate and testis were further annotated to their corresponding nucleotide and protein sequences as described in Example 1. The obtained prostate specific nucleotide and protein sequences were summarized in Table 36 and the obtained testis specific nucleotide and protein sequences were summarized in Table 37.

Similarly to identify nucleotide and protein sequences that were specific to female organs mammary gland and uterus MPSS data of prostate and testis were first removed from MPSS dataset of the thirty two tissues that were described in Example 1. MPSS data of the remaining thirty tissues were then used to identify organ specific MPSS sequences as described in Example 1. MPSS sequences that were specific to mammary gland and uterus were further annotated to their corresponding nucleotide and protein sequences following the procedure described in Example 1. The obtained mammary gland specific nucleotide and protein sequences were summarized in Table 38 and the obtained uterus specific proteins were summarized in Table 39.

This example shows the identification of protein sets that are potential biomarkers for prostate cancer.

LNCaP cell line is a cellular model for early stage prostate cancer and CL1 cell line is a cellular model for late stage prostate cancer. Normalized MPSS dataset of LNCaP cells and CL1 cells were obtained for the purpose of identifying potential biomarkers for prostate cancer. The new data were combined with the normalized MPSS dataset of the thirty two tissues that were described in Example 1. Normal prostate LNCaP and CL1 specific nucleotide and protein sequences were identified from the combined dataset and were potential biomarkers for prostate cancer.

More specifically MPSS data of female organs mammary gland and uterus were first removed from MPSS dataset of the thirty two tissues described in Example 1. MPSS data of the remaining thirty tissues were then combined with normalized MPSS dataset of LNCaP cells and CL1 cells. Following the procedure described in Example 1 the combined MPSS dataset of the thirty two samples the thirty two tissues described in Example 1 minus mammary gland and uterus and plus LNCaP and CL1 cells was used to identify nucleotide and protein sequences that were specific to CL1 cells Table 40 LNCaP cells Table 41 and normal prostate Table 42 . While normal prostate specific nucleotide and protein sequences are potential biomarkers for the lack of prostate cancer LNCaP specific nucleotide and protein sequences are potential biomarkers for early stage prostate cancer and CL1 specific nucleotide and protein sequences are potential biomarkers for late stage prostate cancer. The obtained CL1 specific nucleotide and protein sequences were summarized in Table 40 the obtained LNCaP specific nucleotide and protein sequences were summarized in Table 41 and the obtained normal prostate specific nucleotide and protein sequences were summarized in Table 42.

Large amounts of mass spectrometry data on protein identifications are accumulated very rapidly in the proteomics field. Such data provide insightful information on the presence of proteins in various biological specimens. This example shows the collection of organ specific proteins that have been identified by mass spectrometry in body fluids such as serum plasma and seminal plasma.

Hundreds to thousands of proteins were identified in body fluids such as serum plasma and seminal plasma in several proteomics studies and are stored in several proteomics databases. The available mass spectrometry datasets on protein identifications include 1 human plasma proteins that were identified and managed by the Human Proteome Organization HUPO Omenn et al. . 2005 3226 45 2 peptides that were identified from human plasma PeptideAtlas Deutsch et al. 2005 3497 500 3 human plasma N glycoproteins Liu et al. 2005 2070 80 4 human seminal plasma proteins Pilch B. and Mann M. 2006 R40 5 N glycopeptides that were identified from various human specimens and 6 proprietary human serum protein databases. Proteins in the original datasets were specified by their accession numbers in either different protein sequence databases or different versions of the databases. Thus proteins were not consistently annotated which made it impossible to directly combine proteins in different datasets. To solve this problem peptides that were directly identified from mass spectrometry data were downloaded from datasets 1 6 . These peptides were then assembled to proteins in RefSeq database ftp ftp.ncbi.nih.gov refseq H sapiens following a procedure described in the ProteinProphet algorithm Nesvizhskii et al. 2003 4646 58 . Hence we obtained a list of proteins and their belonging peptides that were identified in body fluids by mass spectrometry.

Proteins that were identified in body fluids by mass spectrometry were then compared with organ specific proteins identified in Examples 1 6 and 7. The overlap between proteins identified in body fluids and organ specific proteins listed in Tables 1 32 was summarized in Table 43. The overlap between proteins identified in body fluids and proteins specific to sex organs prostate testis mammary gland and uterus that were listed in Tables 36 39 was summarized in Table 44. The overlap between proteins identified in body fluids and potential protein biomarkers for prostate cancer that were listed in Tables 40 42 was summarized in Table 45.

This example shows the identification of organ specific protein sets from normal healthy organs using sequencing by synthesis SBS .

A total of 53 samples of human normal tissues and epithelial cells were collected from different patients see Table 46 for details . These samples were different from the samples used to generate the MPSS dataset described in Example 1. RNA molecules were extracted from each sample using standard procedures see e.g. Example 5 . Collected RNA samples were then sent to Solexa Hayward Calif. USA now part of Illumine San Diego Calif. USA to measure the abundance of RNA molecules in each sample using their sequencing by synthesis SBS RNA analysis platform see e.g. Johnson D S et al. 2007 Science 316 5830 1441 2 A. Barski et al. 2007 Cell 129 823 837 T. Mikkelsen at al. Nature. 2007 448 7153 553 60 G. Robertson at al. Nature Methods 2007 August 4 8 651 7 . Some samples were analyzed in duplicate for example the two breast samples . As a result a total of 64 SBS datasets were received from Solexa See Table 46 .

Similar to MPSS data each SBS dataset contains all identified SBS tags each tag comprised of a DNA sequence 20 bases in length their raw counts that qualify the abundance of the tags in the sample their annotations to the UniGene database their classification classes based on annotation quality and descriptions of the corresponding UniGene entries to which the tags are annotated. This SBS dataset was then used to identify organ specific proteins as described below.

Some SBS datasets such as HCC01 A and HCC01 B were generated from the same tissue. Some such as HCC18 and HCC51 were generated from tissues of the same organ but from different patients. In addition some samples were closely related to each other for example hepatocytes and liver . To identify organ specific proteins all SBS datasets were assigned to one of the 25 organs listed in Table 46.

The methods for identifying organ specific SBS tags were similar to those for identifying organ specific MPSS tags as described in Example 1. There were a few modifications to accommodate difference in the two datasets. In particular as outlined further below changes were made to account for having multiple SBS datasets for some organs see e.g. Table 46 multiple samples for breast spleen lymph node etc. .

One of the modifications was first to normalize raw counts of SBS tags to transcription per million tpm . In comparison MPSS data were already normalized to tpm. The methods for identifying organ specific SBS tags were as follows.

Assume the expression in tpm of a SBS sequence tag in the 64 SBS datasets was X where i 1 2 . . . 25 represents individual organs and j 1 2 . . . krepresents individual datasets of the same organ. Apparently k 1 if organ i had only one dataset. For each organ we first evaluated the following three quantities 

Assume organ m had the highest value of X among all organs. We then applied three rules to determine whether the tag was specific to organ m as follows 

i The highest expression of the tag in organ m was above a minimal estimated noise level i.e. X 5. 4 

ii The highest expression of the tag in organ m was well above the averaged expression of the tag in all other tissues. More specifically we first calculated the mean averaged expression of the tag in the other 24 organs except organ m as

We then evaluated the significance that the expression of the tag in organ m was above the expression of the tag in other organs as

iii The specificity f of the tag in organ m had to be well above a pre selected cutoff value f. More precisely we defined the specificity of the tag in tissue m as

A tag was identified as specific to organ m if its expression satisfied the three conditions in Eqs. 4 9 and 14 .

The mapping of organ specific SBS tags to organ specific proteins was the same as that for the MPSS data as described in Example 1.

All proteins discovered from SBS data as specific to male or female sex organs were listed in Tables 72 77. The methods for this analysis are as described in Example 6.

All organ specific proteins discovered from SBS data and previously identified by mass spectrometry were listed in Table 78. The methods for this analysis are as described in Example 8.

All proteins discovered from SBS data as specific to male or female sex organs and previously identified by mass spectrometry were listed in Table 79. The methods for this analysis are as described in Example 8.
