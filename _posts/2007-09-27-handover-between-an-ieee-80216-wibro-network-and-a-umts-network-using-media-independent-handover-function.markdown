title: Handover between an IEEE 802.16 WiBro network and a UMTS network using media independent handover function
abstract: A wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU) may include an IEEE 802.16 modem, a universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) modem and a media independent handover (MIH) entity. Software application programming interfaces provide the MIH entity with mechanisms to receive information about IEEE 802.16 and UMTS links, control IEEE 802.16 and UMTS modems for handover, discover an MIH server and IP multimedia system nodes, trigger mobile IP handover, etc. If an IEEE 802.16 link has been successfully established, the MIH entity starts an MIH session. When the IEEE 802.16 modem indicates that a connection is going to be terminated, the MIH entity activates the UMTS modem for handover. If the IEEE 802.16 modem indicates that a link parameter has crossed a threshold, the MIH entity sends IEEE 802.16 and WCDMA signal measurements to an MIH server. After receiving an MIH switch request, the MIH entity initiates handover to the UMTS network.
