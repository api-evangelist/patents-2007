The present invention relates to novel optimized Fc variants engineering methods for their generation and their application particularly for therapeutic purposes.

Antibodies are immunological proteins that bind a specific antigen. In most mammals including humans and mice antibodies are constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains. Each chain is made up of individual immunoglobulin Ig domains and thus the generic term immunoglobulin is used for such proteins. Each chain is made up of two distinct regions referred to as the variable and constant regions. The light and heavy chain variable regions show significant sequence diversity between antibodies and are responsible for binding the target antigen. The constant regions show less sequence diversity and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. In humans there are five different classes of antibodies including IgA which includes subclasses IgA1 and IgA2 IgD IgE IgG which includes subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4 and IgM. The distinguishing features between these antibody classes are their constant regions although subtler differences may exist in the variable region. shows an IgG1 antibody used here as an example to describe the general structural features of immunoglobulins. IgG antibodies are tetrameric proteins composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. The IgG heavy chain is composed of four immunoglobulin domains linked from N to C terminus in the order V C1 C2 C3 referring to the variable heavy domain constant heavy domain 1 constant heavy domain 2 and constant heavy domain 3. The IgG C1 C and Cdomains are also referred to as constant gamma 1 domain C 1 constant gamma 2 domain C 2 and constant gamma 3 domain C 3 respectively. The IgG light chain is composed of two immunoglobulin domains linked from N to C terminus in the order V C referring to the light chain variable domain and the light chain constant domain respectively.

The variable region of an antibody contains the antigen binding determinants of the molecule and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen. The variable region is so named because it is the most distinct in sequence from other antibodies within the same class. The majority of sequence variability occurs in the complementarity determining regions CDRs . There are 6 CDRs total three each per heavy and light chain designated VCDR1 VCDR2 VCDR3 VCDR1 VCDR2 and VCDR3. The variable region outside of the CDRs is referred to as the framework FR region. Although not as diverse as the CDRs sequence variability does occur in the FR region between different antibodies. Overall this characteristic architecture of antibodies provides a stable scaffold the FR region upon which substantial antigen binding diversity the CDRs can be explored by the immune system to obtain specificity for a broad array of antigens. A number of high resolution structures are available for a variety of variable region fragments from different organisms some unbound and some in complex with antigen. The sequence and structural features of antibody variable regions are well characterized Morea et al. 1997 Biophys Chem 68 9 16 Morea et al. 2000 Methods 20 267 279 incorporated by reference and the conserved features of antibodies have enabled the development of a wealth of antibody engineering techniques Maynard et al. 2000 Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2 339 376 incorporated by reference . For example it is possible to graft the CDRs from one antibody for example a murine antibody onto the framework region of another antibody for example a human antibody. This process referred to in the art as humanization enables generation of less immunogenic antibody therapeutics from nonhuman antibodies. Fragments comprising the variable region can exist in the absence of other regions of the antibody including for example the antigen binding fragment Fab comprising V C 1 and V C the variable fragment Fv comprising Vand V the single chain variable fragment scFv comprising Vand Vlinked together in the same chain as well as a variety of other variable region fragments Little et al. 2000 Immunol Today 21 364 370 incorporated by reference .

The Fc region of an antibody interacts with a number of Fc receptors and ligands imparting an array of important functional capabilities referred to as effector functions. For IgG the Fc region as shown in comprises Ig domains C 2 and C 3 and the N terminal hinge leading into C 2. An important family of Fc receptors for the IgG class are the Fc gamma receptors Fc Rs . These receptors mediate communication between antibodies and the cellular arm of the immune system Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ravetch et al. 2001 Annu Rev Immunol 19 275 290 . In humans this protein family includes Fc RI CD64 including isoforms Fc RIa Fc RIb and Fc RIc Fc RII CD32 including isoforms Fc RIIa including allotypes H131 and R131 Fc RIIb including Fc RIIb 1 and Fc RIIb 2 and Fc RIIc and Fc RIII CD16 including isoforms Fc RIIIa including allotypes V158 and F158 and Fc RIIIb including allotypes Fc RIIIb NA1 and Fc RIIIb NA2 Jefferis et al. 2002 Immunol Lett 82 57 65 incorporated by reference . These receptors typically have an extracellular domain that mediates binding to Fc a membrane spanning region and an intracellular domain that may mediate some signaling event within the cell. These receptors are expressed in a variety of immune cells including monocytes macrophages neutrophils dendritic cells eosinophils mast cells platelets B cells large granular lymphocytes Langerhans cells natural killer NK cells and T cells. Formation of the Fc Fc R complex recruits these effector cells to sites of bound antigen typically resulting in signaling events within the cells and important subsequent immune responses such as release of inflammation mediators B cell activation endocytosis phagocytosis and cytotoxic attack. The ability to mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions is a potential mechanism by which antibodies destroy targeted cells. The cell mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc Rs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ghetie et al. 2000 Annu Rev Immunol 18 739 766 Ravetch et al. 2001 Annu Rev Immunol 19 275 290 incorporated by reference . The cell mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc Rs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell mediated phagocytosis ADCP . A number of structures have been solved of the extracellular domains of human Fc Rs including Fc RIIa pdb accession code 1 H9V Sondermann et al. 2001 J Mol Biol 309 737 749 pdb accession code 1FCG Maxwell et al. 1999 Nat Struct Biol 6 437 442 Fc RIIb pdb accession code 2FCB Sondermann et al. 1999 Embo J 18 1095 1103 and Fc RIIIb pdb accession code 1E4J Sondermann et al. 2000 Nature 406 267 273 incorporated by reference . All Fc Rs bind the same region on Fc at the N terminal end of the C 2 domain and the preceding hinge shown in . This interaction is well characterized structurally Sondermann et al. 2001 J Mol Biol 309 737 749 incorporated by reference and several structures of the human Fc bound to the extracellular domain of human Fc RIIIb have been solved pdb accession code 1E4K Sondermann et al. 2000 Nature 406 267 273 pdb accession codes 1IIS and 1IIX Radaev et al. 2001 J Biol Chem 276 16469 16477 incorporated by reference as well as has the structure of the human IgE Fc Fc RI complex pdb accession code 1F6A Garman et al. 2000 Nature 406 259 266 incorporated by reference .

The different IgG subclasses have different affinities for the Fc Rs with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the receptors than IgG2 and IgG4. All Fc Rs bind the same region on IgG Fc yet with different affinities the high affinity binder Fc RI has a Kd for IgG1 of 10M whereas the low affinity receptors Fc RII and Fc RIII generally bind at 10and 10respectively. The extracellular domains of Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIIb are 96 identical however Fc RIIIb does not have a intracellular signaling domain. Furthermore whereas Fc RI Fc RIIa c and Fc RIIIa are positive regulators of immune complex triggered activation characterized by having an intracellular domain that has an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM Fc RIIb has an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM and is therefore inhibitory. Thus the former are referred to as activation receptors and Fc RIIb is referred to as an inhibitory receptor. The receptors also differ in expression pattern and levels on different immune cells. Yet another level of complexity is the existence of a number of Fc R polymorphisms in the human proteome. A particularly relevant polymorphism with clinical significance is V158 F158 Fc RIIIa. Human IgG1 binds with greater affinity to the V158 allotype than to the F158 allotype. This difference in affinity and presumably its effect on ADCC and or ADCP has been shown to be a significant determinant of the efficacy of the anti CD20 antibody rituximab Rituxan a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation . Patients with the V158 allotype respond favorably to rituximab treatment however patients with the lower affinity F158 allotype respond poorly Cartron et al. 2002 Blood 99 754 758 incorporated by reference . Approximately 10 20 of humans are V158 V158 homozygous 45 are V158 F158 heterozygous and 35 45 of humans are F158 F158 homozygous Lehrnbecher et al. 1999 94 4220 4232 Cartron et al. 2002 99 754 758 incorporated by reference . Thus 80 90 of humans are poor responders that is they have at least one allele of the F158 Fc RIIIa.

An overlapping but separate site on Fc shown in serves as the interface for the complement protein C1q. In the same way that Fc Fc R binding mediates ADCC Fc C1q binding mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . C1q forms a complex with the serine proteases C1r and C1s to form the C1 complex. C1q is capable of binding six antibodies although binding to two IgGs is sufficient to activate the complement cascade. Similar to Fc interaction with Fc Rs different IgG subclasses have different affinity for C1q with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the Fc Rs than IgG2 and IgG4. There is currently no structure available for the Fc C1q complex however mutagenesis studies have mapped the binding site on human IgG for C1q to a region involving residues D270 K322 K326 P329 and P331 and E333 Idusogie et al. 2000 164 4178 4184 Idusogie et al. 2001 166 2571 2575 incorporated by reference .

A site on Fc between the C 2 and C 3 domains shown in mediates interaction with the neonatal receptor FcRn the binding of which recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream Raghavan et al. 1996 12 181 220 Ghetie et al. 2000 18 739 766 incorporated by reference . This process coupled with preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full length molecule results in favorable antibody serum half lives ranging from one to three weeks. Binding of Fc to FcRn also plays a key role in antibody transport. The binding site for FcRn on Fc is also the site at which the bacterial proteins A and G bind. The tight binding by these proteins is typically exploited as a means to purify antibodies by employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during protein purification. Thus the fidelity of this region on Fc is important for both the clinical properties of antibodies and their purification. Available structures of the rat Fc FcRn complex Martin et al. 2001 7 867 877 incorporated by reference and of the complexes of Fc with proteins A and G Deisenhofer 1981 20 2361 2370 Sauer Eriksson et al. 1995 3 265 278 Tashiro et al. 1995 5 471 481 incorporated by reference provide insight into the interaction of Fc with these proteins.

A key feature of the Fc region is the conserved N linked glycosylation that occurs at N297 shown in . This carbohydrate or oligosaccharide as it is sometimes referred plays a critical structural and functional role for the antibody and is one of the principle reasons that antibodies must be produced using mammalian expression systems. While not wanting to be limited to one theory it is believed that the structural purpose of this carbohydrate may be to stabilize or solubilize Fc determine a specific angle or level of flexibility between the C 3 and C 2 domains keep the two C 2 domains from aggregating with one another across the central axis or a combination of these. Efficient Fc binding to Fc R and C1q requires this modification and alterations in the composition of the N297 carbohydrate or its elimination affect binding to these proteins Uma a et al. 1999 17 176 180 Davies et at. 2001 74 288 294 Mimura et al. 2001 276 45539 45547. Radaev et al. 2001 276 16478 16483 Shields et al. 2001 276 6591 6604 Shields et al. 2002 277 26733 26740 Simmons et al. 2002 263 133 147 incorporated by reference . Yet the carbohydrate makes little if any specific contact with Fc Rs Radaev et al. 2001 276 16469 16477 incorporated by reference indicating that the functional role of the N297 carbohydrate in mediating Fc Fc R binding may be via the structural role it plays in determining the Fc conformation. This is supported by a collection of crystal structures of four different Fc glycoforms which show that the composition of the oligosaccharide impacts the conformation of C 2 and as a result the Fc Fc R interface Krapp et al. 2003 325 979 989 incorporated by reference .

The features of antibodies discussed above specificity for target ability to mediate immune effector mechanisms and long half life in serum make antibodies powerful therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies are used therapeutically for the treatment of a variety of conditions including cancer inflammation and cardiovascular disease. There are currently over ten antibody products on the market and hundreds in development. In addition to antibodies an antibody like protein that is finding an expanding role in research and therapy is the Fc fusion Chamow et al. 1996 14 52 60 Ashkenazi et al. 1997 9 195 200 incorporated by reference . An Fc fusion is a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to Fc. An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an antibody and thus its favorable effector functions and pharmacokinetics with the target binding region of a receptor ligand or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the latter is to mediate target recognition and thus it is functionally analogous to the antibody variable region. Because of the structural and functional overlap of Fc fusions with antibodies the discussion on antibodies in the present invention extends directly to Fc fusions.

There are a number of possible mechanisms by which antibodies destroy tumor cells including anti proliferation via blockage of needed growth pathways intracellular signaling leading to apoptosis enhanced down regulation and or turnover of receptors CDC ADCC ADCP and promotion of an adaptive immune response Cragg et al. 1999 11 541 547 Glennie et al. 2000 21 403 410. incorporated by reference . Anti tumor efficacy may be due to a combination of these mechanisms and their relative importance in clinical therapy appears to be cancer dependent. Despite this arsenal of anti tumor weapons the potency of antibodies as anti cancer agents is unsatisfactory particularly given their high cost. Patient tumor response data show that monoclonal antibodies provide only a small improvement in therapeutic success over normal single agent cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. For example just half of all relapsed low grade non Hodgkin s lymphoma patients respond to the anti CD20 antibody rituximab McLaughlin et al. 1998 16 2825 2833. incorporated by reference . Of 166 clinical patients 6 showed a complete response and 42 showed a partial response with median response duration of approximately 12 months. Trastuzumab Herceptin a registered trademark of Genentech an anti HER2 neu antibody for treatment of metastatic breast cancer has less efficacy. The overall response rate using trastuzumab for the 222 patients tested was only 15 with 8 complete and 26 partial responses and a median response duration and survival of 9 to 13 months Cobleigh et al. 1999 17 2639 2648 incorporated by reference . Currently for anticancer therapy any small improvement in mortality rate defines success. Thus there is a significant need to enhance the capacity of antibodies to destroy targeted cancer cells.

The role of Fc R mediated effector functions in the anti cancer activity of antibodies has been demonstrated in mice Clynes et al. 1998 95 652 656 Clynes et al. 2000 6 443 446 incorporated by reference and the affinity of interaction between Fc and certain Fc Rs correlates with targeted cytotoxicity in cell based assays Shields et al. 2001 276 6591 6604 Presta et al. 2002 30 487 490 Shields et al. 2002 277 26733 26740 incorporated by reference . Additionally a correlation has been observed between clinical efficacy in humans and their allotype of high V158 or low F158 affinity polymorphic forms of Fc RIIIa Cartron et al. 2002 99 754 758 incorporated by reference .

Mutagenesis studies have been carried out on Fc towards various goals with substitutions typically made to alanine referred to as alanine scanning or guided by sequence homology substitutions Duncan et al. 1988 332 563 564 Lund et al. 1991 147 2657 2662 Lund et al. 1992 29 53 59 Jefferis et al. 1995 44 111 117 Lund et al. 1995 9 115 119 Jefferis et al. 1996 54 101 104 Lund et al. 1996 157 4963 4969 Armour et al. 1999 29 2613 2624 Shields et al. 2001 276 6591 6604 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 U.S. Pat. No. 5 885 573 PCT WO 00 42072 PCT WO 99 58572 all incorporated by reference. The majority of substitutions reduce or ablate binding with Fc Rs. However some success has been achieved at obtaining Fc variants with higher Fc R affinity. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 and PCT WO 00 42072 . For example Winter and colleagues substituted the human amino acid at position 235 of mouse IgG2b antibody a glutamic acid to leucine mutation that increased binding of the mouse antibody to human Fc RI by 100 fold Duncan et al. 1988 332 563 564 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 . Shields et al. used alanine scanning mutagenesis to map Fc residues important to Fc R binding followed by substitution of select residues with non alanine mutations Shields et al. 2001 276 6591 6604 Presta et al. 2002 30 487 490 PCT WO 00 42072 incorporated by reference.

Enhanced affinity of Fc for Fc R has also been achieved using engineered glycoforms generated by expression of antibodies in engineered or variant cell lines Umana et al. 1999 17 176 180 Davies et al. 2001 74 288 294 Shields et al. 2002 277 26733 26740 Shinkawa et al. 2003 278 3466 3473 incorporated by reference . This approach has generated enhancement of the capacity of antibodies to bind Fc RIIIa and to mediate ADCC.

Another major shortcoming of antibodies is their demanding production requirements Garber 2001 19 184 185 Dove 2002 20 777 779 incorporated by reference . Antibodies must be expressed in mammalian cells and the currently marketed antibodies together with other high demand biotherapeutics consume essentially all of the available manufacturing capacity. With hundreds of biologics in development the majority of which are antibodies there is an urgent need for more efficient and cheaper methods of production. The downstream effects of insufficient antibody manufacturing capacity are three fold. First it dramatically raises the cost of goods to the producer a cost that is passed on to the patient. Second it hinders industrial production of approved antibody products limiting availability of high demand therapeutics to patients. Finally because clinical trials require large amounts of a protein that is not yet profitable the insufficient supply impedes progress of the growing antibody pipeline to market.

Alternative production methods have been explored in attempts at alleviating this problem. Transgenic plants and animals are being pursued as potentially cheaper and higher capacity production systems Chadd et al. 2001 12 188 194 incorporated by reference . Such expression systems however can generate glycosylation patterns significantly different from human glycoproteins. This may result in reduced or even lack of effector function because as discussed above the carbohydrate structure can significantly impact Fc R and complement binding. A potentially greater problem with nonhuman glycoforms may be immunogenicity carbohydrates are a key source of antigenicity for the immune system and the presence of nonhuman glycoforms has a significant chance of eliciting antibodies that neutralize the therapeutic or worse cause adverse immune reactions. Thus the efficacy and safety of antibodies produced by transgenic plants and animals remains uncertain. Bacterial expression is another attractive solution to the antibody production problem. Expression in bacteria for example provides a cost effective and high capacity method for producing proteins. For complex proteins such as antibodies there are a number of obstacles to bacterial expression including folding and assembly of these complex molecules proper disulfide formation and solubility stability and functionality in the absence of glycosylation because proteins expressed in bacteria are not glycosylated. Full length unglycosylated antibodies that bind antigen have been successfully expressed in E. coli Simmons et al. 2002 263 133 147 incorporated by reference and thus folding assembly and proper disulfide formation of bacterially expressed antibodies are possible in the absence of the eukaryotic chaperone machinery. However the ultimate utility of bacterially expressed antibodies as therapeutics remains hindered by the lack of glycosylation which results in lack effector function and may result in poor stability and solubility. This will likely be more problematic for formulation at the high concentrations for the prolonged periods demanded by clinical use.

This set of variants is sometimes referenced to as the single variant set of the invention.

It is an additional aspect of the invention to provide Fc variants and proteins containing these variants that have at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 or more amino acid substitutions as compared to the parent Fc polypeptide for example the Fc region SEQ ID NO 1. In some embodiments 1 2 3 and 4 substitutions find particular use.

It is a further aspect of the invention to provide Fc variants and proteins containing these variants that exhibit altered Fc ligand binding as compared to the parent Fc polypeptide for example the Fc region of SEQ ID NO 1 and that are encoded by nucleic acids that hybridize under high stringency conditions to a gene that encodes a human Fc polypeptide. High stringency conditions are known in the art see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 875 846 hereby incorporated by reference particularly for high stringency conditions. Genes that encode human Fc polypeptides are usually fragments of larger genes and are also known in the art as well as genes that due to the degeneracy of the genetic code will encode a naturally occurring Fc polypeptide even if not naturally occurring themselves.

Accordingly by parent Fc polypeptide as used herein is meant a Fc polypeptide that is modified to generate a variant and by parent antibody as used herein is meant an antibody that is modified to generate a variant antibody.

As outlined above certain positions of the Fc molecule can be altered. By Position as used herein is meant a location in the sequence of a protein. Positions may be numbered sequentially or according to an established format for example the EU index as in Kabat. For example position 297 is a position in the human antibody IgG1.

By variant polypeptide as used herein is meant a polypeptide sequence that differs from that of a parent polypeptide sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. The parent polypeptide may be a naturally occurring or wild type WT polypeptide or may be a modified version of a WT polypeptide. Variant polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself a composition comprising the polypeptide or the amino sequence that encodes it. Preferably the variant polypeptide has at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent polypeptide e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid modifications and preferably from about one to about five amino acid modifications compared to the parent. The variant polypeptide sequence herein will preferably possess at least about 80 homology with a parent polypeptide sequence and most preferably at least about 90 homology more preferably at least about 95 homology.

An Fc variant may only encompass an Fc region or may exist in the context of an antibody Fc fusion isolated Fc Fc fragment or other polypeptide that is substantially encoded by Fc. Fc variant may refer to the Fc polypeptide itself compositions comprising the Fc variant polypeptide or the amino acid sequence that encodes it.

The Fc variants of the present invention are defined according to the amino acid modifications that compose them. Thus for example I332E is an Fc variant with the substitution I332E relative to the parent Fc polypeptide. Likewise S239D A330L I332E also referred to as 239D 330L 332E defines an Fc variant with the substitutions S239D A330L and I332E 239D 330L and 332E relative to the parent Fc polypeptide. It is noted that the order in which substitutions are provided is arbitrary that is to say that for example S239D A330L I332E is the same Fc variant as S239D I332E A330L and so on. For all positions discussed in the present invention numbering is according to the EU index or EU numbering scheme Kabat et al. 1991 5th Ed. United States Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda incorporated by reference . The EU index or EU index as in Kabat refers to the numbering of the EU antibody Edelman et al. 1969 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 63 78 85 incorporated by reference .

The present invention is directed to optimized Fc variants useful in a variety of contexts. As outlined above current antibody therapies suffer from a variety of problems. The present invention provides a promising means for enhancing the anti tumor potency of antibodies is via enhancement of their ability to mediate cytotoxic effector functions such as ADCC ADCP and CDC. The present invention shows that antibodies with an Fc region optimized for binding to certain Fc Rs may better mediate effector functions and thereby destroy cancer cells more effectively in patients. The balance between activating and inhibiting receptors is an important consideration and optimal effector function may result from an Fc with enhanced affinity for activation receptors for example Fc RI Fc RIIa c and Fc RIIa yet reduced affinity for the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb. Furthermore because Fc Rs can mediate antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells enhanced Fc Fc R affinity may also improve the capacity of antibody therapeutics to elicit an adaptive immune response. For example several mutations disclosed in this application including S298A E333A and K334A show enhanced binding to the activating receptor Fc RIIIa and reduced binding to the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb. These mutations maybe combined to obtain double and triple mutation variants that show additive improvements in binding. A particular variant is a S298A E333A K334A triple mutant with approximately a 1.7 fold increase in binding to F158 Fc RIIIa a 5 fold decrease in binding to Fc RIIb and a 2.1 fold enhancement in ADCC.

Although there is a need for greater effector function for some antibody therapeutics reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. This is often the case for therapeutic antibodies whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen. In these cases depletion of target cells is undesirable and can be considered a side effect. For example the ability of anti CD4 antibodies to block CD4 receptors on T cells makes them effective anti inflammatories yet their ability to recruit Fc R receptors also directs immune attack against the target cells resulting in T cell depletion Reddy et al. 2000 164 1925 1933 incorporated by reference . Effector function can also be a problem for radiolabeled antibodies referred to as radioconjugates and antibodies conjugated to toxins referred to as immunotoxins. These drugs can be used to destroy cancer cells but the recruitment of immune cells via Fc interaction with Fc Rs brings healthy immune cells in proximity to the deadly payload radiation or toxin resulting in depletion of normal lymphoid tissue along with targeted cancer cells Hutchins et al. 1995 92 11980 11984 White et al. 2001 52 125 145 incorporated by reference . This problem can potentially be circumvented by using IgG isotypes that poorly recruit complement or effector cells for example IgG2 and IgG4. An alternate solution is to develop Fc variants that reduce or ablate binding Alegre et al. 1994 57 1537 1543 Hutchins et al. 1995 92 11980 11984 Armour et al. 1999 29 2613 2624 Reddy et al. 2000 164 1925 1933 Xu et al. 2000 200 16 26 Shields et al. 2001 276 6591 6604 U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551 U.S. Pat. No. 5 885 573 PCT WO 99 58572 all incorporated by reference. A critical consideration for the reduction or elimination of effector function is that other important antibody properties not be perturbed. Fc variants should be engineered that not only ablate binding to Fc Rs and or C1q but also maintain antibody stability solubility and structural integrity as well as ability to interact with other important Fc ligands such as FcRn and proteins A and G.

In addition the invention utilizes engineered glycoforms that can enhance Fc Fc R affinity and effector function. An aglycosylated Fc with favorable solution properties and the capacity to mediate effector functions would be significantly enabling for the alternate production methods described above. By overcoming the structural and functional shortcomings of aglycosylated Fc antibodies can be produced in bacteria and transgenic plants and animals with reduced risk of immunogenicity and with effector function for clinical applications in which cytotoxicity is desired such as cancer. The present invention describes the utilization of protein engineering methods to develop stable soluble Fc variants with effector function. Currently such Fc variants do not exist in the art.

The Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a variety of Fc polypeptides. An Fc polypeptide that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention is herein referred to as an Fc polypeptide of the present invention . Fc polypeptides of the present invention include polypeptides that comprise the Fc variants of the present invention in the context of a larger polypeptide such as an antibody or Fc fusion. That is Fc polypeptides of the present invention include antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants of the present invention. By antibody of the present invention as used herein is meant an antibody that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. By Fc fusion of the Present invention as used herein refers to an Fc fusion that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. Fc polypeptides of the present invention also include polypeptides that comprise little or no additional polypeptide sequence other than the Fc region referred to as an isolated Fc. By isolated Fc of the present invention used herein is meant an Fc polypeptide that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention and comprises little or no additional polypeptide sequence other than the Fc region. Fc polypeptides of the present invention also include fragments of the Fc region. By Fc fragment of the present invention as used herein is meant an Fc fragment that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. As described below any of the aforementioned Fc polypeptides of the present invention may be fused to one or more fusion partners or conjugate partners to provide desired functional properties.

Fc variants may be constructed in a parent Fc polypeptide irrespective of its context. That is to say that the sole criteria for a parent Fc polypeptide is that it comprise an Fc region. The parent Fc polypeptides described herein may be derived from a wide range of sources and may be substantially encoded by one or more Fc genes from any organism including but not limited to humans rodents including but not limited to mice and rats lagomorpha such as rabbits and hares camelidae such as camels llamas and dromedaries and non human primates including but not limited to Prosimians Platyrrhini New World monkeys Cercopithecoidea Old World monkeys and Hominoidea include the Gibbons Lesser and Great Apes with humans most preferred. The parent Fc polypeptides of the present invention may be substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes including but not limited to sequences belonging to the IgG including human subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 IgA including human subclasses IgA1 and IgA2 IgD IgE IgG or IgM classes of antibodies. Most preferably the parent Fc polypeptides of the present invention comprise sequences belonging to the human IgG class of antibodies. For example the parent Fc polypeptide may be a parent antibody for example a human IgG1 antibody a human IgA antibody or a mouse IgG2a or IgG2b antibody. Said parent antibody may be nonhuman chimeric humanized or fully human as described in detail below. The parent Fc polypeptide may be modified or engineered in some way for example a parent antibody may be affinity matured or may possess engineered glycoforms all as described more fully below. Alternatively the parent Fc polypeptide may be an Fc fusion for example an Fc fusion wherein the fusion partner targets a cell surface receptor. Alternatively the parent Fc polypeptide may be an isolated Fc region comprising little or no other polypeptide sequence outside the Fc region. The parent Fc polypeptide may be a naturally existing Fc region or may be an existing engineered variant of an Fc polypeptide. What is important is that the parent Fc polypeptide comprise an Fc region which can then be mutated to generate an Fc variant.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be an antibody referred to herein as an antibody of the present invention . Antibodies of the present invention may comprise immunoglobulin sequences that are substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes including but not limited to IgG including human subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 IgA including human subclasses IgA1 and IgA2 IgD IgE IgG and IgM classes of antibodies. Most preferably the antibodies of the present invention comprise sequences belonging to the human IgG class of antibodies. Antibodies of the present invention may be nonhuman chimeric humanized or fully human. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art these different types of antibodies reflect the degree of humanness or potential level of immunogenicity in a human. For a description of these concepts see Clark et al. 2000 and references cited therein Clark 2000 21 397 402 incorporated by reference . Chimeric antibodies comprise the variable region of a nonhuman antibody for example Vand Vdomains of mouse or rat origin operably linked to the constant region of a human antibody see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 incorporated by reference . Said nonhuman variable region may be derived from any organism as described above preferably mammals and most preferably rodents or primates. In one embodiment the antibody of the present invention comprises monkey variable domains for example as described in Newman et al. 1992 Biotechnology 10 1455 1460 U.S. Pat. No. 5 658 570 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 750 105 incorporated by reference. In a preferred embodiment the variable region is derived from a nonhuman source but its immunogenicity has been reduced using protein engineering. In a preferred embodiment the antibodies of the present invention are humanized Tsurushita Vasquez 2004 Humanization of Monoclonal Antibodies Molecular Biology of B Cells 533 545 Elsevier Science USA incorporated by reference . By humanized antibody as used herein is meant an antibody comprising a human framework region FR and one or more complementarity determining regions CDR s from a non human usually mouse or rat antibody. The non human antibody providing the CDR s is called the donor and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the acceptor . Humanization relies principally on the grafting of donor CDRs onto acceptor human Vand Vframeworks Winter U.S. Pat. No. 5 225 539 incorporated by reference . This strategy is referred to as CDR grafting . Backmutation of selected acceptor framework residues to the corresponding donor residues is often required to regain affinity that is lost in the initial grafted construct U.S. Pat. No. 5 530 101 U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 U.S. Pat. No. 5 693 761 U.S. Pat. No. 5 693 762 U.S. Pat. No. 6 180 370 U.S. Pat. No. 5 859 205 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 U.S. Pat. No. 6 054 297 U.S. Pat. No. 6 407 213 incorporated by reference . A large number of other methods for humanization are known in the art Tsurushita Vasquez 2004 Humanization of Monoclonal Antibodies Molecular Biology of B Cells 533 545 Elsevier Science USA incorporated by reference and any of such methods may find use in the present invention for modifying Fc variants for reduced immunogenicity. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region typically that of a human immunoglobulin and thus will typically comprise a human Fc region. In a most preferred embodiment the immunogenicity of an Fc variant of the present invention is reduced using a method described in U.S. Ser. No. 11 004 590 filed Dec. 3 2004 entitled Methods of Generating Variant Proteins with Increased Host String Content and Compositions Thereof incorporated by reference. In an alternate embodiment the antibodies of the present invention may be fully human that is the sequences of the antibodies are completely or substantially human. A number of methods are known in the art for generating fully human antibodies including the use of transgenic mice Bruggemann et al. 1997 8 455 458 incorporated by reference or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods Griffiths et al. 1998 9 102 108 incorporated by reference .

The Fc variants of the present invention may be an Fc fusion referred to herein as an Fc fusion of the present invention . Fc fusions of the present invention comprise an Fc polypeptide operably linked to one or more fusion partners. The role of the fusion partner typically but not always is to mediate binding of the Fc fusion to a target antigen. Chamow et al. 1996 14 52 60 Ashkenazi et al. 1997 9 195 200 incorporated by reference . For example the approved drug alefacept marketed as AMEVIVE is an immunosuppressive Fc fusion that consists of the extracellular CD2 binding portion of the human leukocyte function antigen 3 LFA 3 linked to the Fc region of human IgG1. The approved drug etanercept marketed as ENBREL is an Fc fusion comprising the extracellular ligand binding portion of human tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFR linked to human IgG1 Fc. Virtually any protein polypeptide peptide or small molecule may be linked to Fc to generate an Fc fusion. Fusion partners include but are not limited to receptors and extracellular receptor domains adhesion molecules ligands enzymes cytokines chemokines or some other protein or protein domain. The fusion partner may also play a role as a chemoattractant. Undiscovered ligands or receptors may serve as fusion partners for the Fc variants of the present invention. Small molecules may serve as fusion partners and may include any therapeutic agent that directs the Fc fusion to a therapeutic target. Such targets may be any molecule preferrably an extracellular receptor that is implicated in disease. Two families of surface receptors that are targets of a number of approved small molecule drugs are G Protein Coupled Receptors GPCRs and ion channels including K Na Ca channels. Nearly 70 of all drugs currently marketed worldwide target GPCRs. Thus the Fc variants of the present invention may be fused to a small molecule that targets for example one or more GABA receptors purinergic receptors adrenergic receptors histaminergic receptors opiod receptors chemokine receptors glutamate receptors nicotinic receptors the 5HT serotonin receptor and estrogen receptors. A fusion partner may be a small molecule mimetic of a protein that targets a therapeutically useful target. Specific examples of particular drugs that may serve as Fc fusion partners can be found in L. S. Goodman et al. Eds. McGraw Hill New York ed. 9 1996 incorporated by reference . Fusion partners include not only small molecules and proteins that bind known targets for existing drugs but orphan receptors that do not yet exist as drug targets. The completion of the genome and proteome projects are proving to be a driving force in drug discovery and these projects have yielded a trove of orphan receptors. There is enormous potential to validate these new molecules as drug targets and develop protein and small molecule therapeutics that target them. Such protein and small molecule therapeutics are contemplated as Fc fusion partners that employ the Fc variants of the present invention. Fc fusions of the invention may comprise immunoglobulin sequences that are substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes including but not limited to IgG including human subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 IgA including human subclasses IgA1 and IgA2 IgD IgE IgG and IgM classes of antibodies. Most preferably the Fc fusions of the present invention comprise sequences belonging to the human IgG class of antibodies. A variety of linkers defined and described below may be used to covalently link Fc to a fusion partner to generate an Fc fusion.

The Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an isolated Fc that is an Fc polypeptide that comprises little or no additional polypeptide sequence other than the Fc region and that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. Isolated Fc of the present invention are meant as molecules wherein the desired function of the molecule for example the desired therapeutic function resides solely in the Fc region. Thus the therapeutic target of an isolated Fc of the present invention is likely to involve one or more Fc ligands. An isolated Fc that comprises the Fc variant may require no additional covalent polypeptide sequence to achieve its desired outcome. In a preferred embodiment said isolated Fc comprises from 90 100 of the Fc region with little or no extra sequence. Thus for example an isolated Fc of the present invention may comprise residues C226 or P230 to the carboxyl terminus of human IgG1 wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In one embodiment the isolated Fc of the present invention may contain no extra sequence outside the Fc region. However it is also contemplated that isolated Fc s may not also comprise additional polypeptide sequences. For example an isolated Fc may in addition to comprising an Fc variant Fc region comprise additional polypeptide sequence tags that enable expression purification and the like.

The Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a fragment of the Fc region that is an Fc polypeptide that comprises an Fc fragment that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. Clearly a requirement of an Fc fragment of the present invention is that it contains the position s at which the amino acid modifications of the Fc variant are made. An Fc fragment of the present invention may comprise from 1 90 of the Fc region with 10 90 being preferred and 30 90 being most preferred. Thus for example an Fc fragment of the present invention may comprise an Fc variant IgG1 C 2 domain an Fc variant IgG1 C 2 domain and hinge region an Fc variant IgG1 C 3 domain and so forth. In one embodiment an Fc fragment of the present invention additionally comprises a fusion partner effectively making it an Fc fragment fusion. As with isolated Fcs Fc fragments may or may not contain extra polypeptide sequence.

Fc variants of the present invention may be substantially encoded by genes from any organism preferably mammals including but not limited to humans rodents including but not limited to mice and rats lagomorpha including but not limited to rabbits and hares camelidae including but not limited to camels llamas and dromedaries and non human primates including but not limited to Prosimians Platyrrhini New World monkeys Cercopithecoidea Old World monkeys and Hominoidea including the Gibbons and Lesser and Great Apes. In a most preferred embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are substantially human. The Fc variants of the present invention may be substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes. In a most preferred embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention comprise sequences belonging to the IgG class of antibodies including human subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4. In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention comprise sequences belonging to the IgA including human subclasses IgA1 and IgA2 IgD IgE IgG or IgM classes of antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may comprise more than one protein chain. That is the present invention may find use in an Fc variant that is a monomer or an oligomer including a homo or hetero oligomer.

In the most preferred embodiment the Fc polypeptides of the invention are based on human IgG sequences and thus human IgG sequences are used as the base sequences against which other sequences are compared including but not limited to sequences from other organisms for example rodent and primate sequences as well as sequences from other immunoglobulin classes such as IgA IgE IgGD IgGM and the like. It is contemplated that although the Fc variants of the present invention are engineered in the context of one parent Fc variant the variants may be engineered in or transferred to the context of another second parent Fc variant. This is done by determining the equivalent or corresponding residues and substitutions between the first and second Fc variants typically based on sequence or structural homology between the sequences of the two Fc variants. In order to establish homology the amino acid sequence of a first Fc variant outlined herein is directly compared to the sequence of a second Fc variant. After aligning the sequences using one or more of the homology alignment programs known in the art for example using conserved residues as between species allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment i.e. avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of the first Fc variant are defined. Alignment of conserved residues preferably should conserve 100 of such residues. However alignment of greater than 75 or as little as 50 of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues. Equivalent residues may also be defined by determining structural homology between a first and second Fc variant that is at the level of tertiary structure for Fc variants whose structures have been determined. In this case equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the parent or precursor N on N CA on CA C on C and O on O are within 0.13 nm and preferably 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non hydrogen protein atoms of the proteins. Regardless of how equivalent or corresponding residues are determined and regardless of the identity of the parent Fc variant in which the Fc variants are made what is meant to be conveyed is that the Fc variants discovered by the present invention may be engineered into any second parent Fc variant that has significant sequence or structural homology with said Fc variant. Thus for example if a variant antibody is generated wherein the parent antibody is human IgG1 by using the methods described above or other methods for determining equivalent residues said variant antibody may be engineered in a human IgG2 parent antibody a human IgA parent antibody a mouse IgG2a or IgG2b parent antibody and the like. Again as described above the context of the parent Fc variant does not affect the ability to transfer the Fc variants of the present invention to other parent Fc variants. For example the variant antibodies that are engineered in a human IgG1 antibody that targets one epitope may be transferred into a human IgG2 antibody that targets a different epitope into an Fc fusion that comprises a human IgG1 Fc region that targets yet a different epitope and so forth.

The Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a wide range of products. In one embodiment the Fc variant of the invention is a therapeutic a diagnostic or a research reagent preferably a therapeutic. Alternatively the Fc variant of the present invention may be used for agricultural or industrial uses. An antibody of the present invention may find use in an antibody composition that is monoclonal or polyclonal. The Fc variants of the present invention may be agonists antagonists neutralizing inhibitory or stimulatory. In a preferred embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are used to kill target cells that bear the target antigen for example cancer cells. In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are used to block antagonize or agonize the target antigen. In an alternately preferred embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are used to block antagonize or agonize the target antigen and kill the target cells that bear the target antigen.

One skilled in the art will appreciate that the aforementioned list of targets refers not only to specific proteins and biomolecules but the biochemical pathway or pathways that comprise them. For example reference to CTLA 4 as a target antigen implies that the ligands and receptors that make up the T cell co stimulatory pathway including CTLA 4 B7 1 B7 2 CD28 and any other undiscovered ligands or receptors that bind these proteins are also targets. Thus target as used herein refers not only to a specific biomolecule but the set of proteins that interact with said target and the members of the biochemical pathway to which said target belongs. One skilled in the art will further appreciate that any of the aforementioned target antigens the ligands or receptors that bind them or other members of their corresponding biochemical pathway may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention in order to generate an Fc fusion. Thus for example an Fc fusion that targets EGFR could be constructed by operably linking an Fc variant to EGF TGF or any other ligand discovered or undiscovered that binds EGFR. Accordingly an Fc variant of the present invention could be operably linked to EGFR in order to generate an Fc fusion that binds EGF TGF or any other ligand discovered or undiscovered that binds EGFR. Thus virtually any polypeptide whether a ligand receptor or some other protein or protein domain including but not limited to the aforementioned targets and the proteins that compose their corresponding biochemical pathways may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention to develop an Fc fusion.

Choosing the right target antigen for antibody therapy is a complex process and encompasses many variables. For anti cancer treatment it is desirable to have a target whose expression is restricted to the cancerous cells. Some targets that have proven especially amenable to antibody therapy are those with signaling functions. Other therapeutic antibodies exert their effects by blocking signaling of the receptor by inhibiting the binding between a receptor and it s cognate ligand. Another mechanism of action of therapeutic antibodies is to cause receptor down regulation. Although many therapeutically effective antibodies work in part by signaling through their target antigen this is not always the case. For example some target classes such as cell surface glycoforms do not generate any biological signal. However altered glycoforms are often associated with disease states such as cancer. Another significant target type are those that internalize either as a normal function or in response to antibody binding. In the case of targets that are soluble rather than cell surface bound the recruitment of effector functions would not result in any cell death.

Some targets that have proven especially amenable to antibody therapy are those with signalling functions. For example antibody cross linking of the Her2 neu antigen may generate an apoptotic signal that results in cancer cell death. In some cases such as the CD30 antigen this clustering with free antibody may be insufficient to cause apoptosis in vitro. For in vitro assays sufficient clustering can be mediated by crosslinking the antibody or by immobilizing it at high density to a surface such as the well of a microtiter plate. However in vivo this effect may be mediated by binding of the antibody to the Fc ligands for example Fc Rs expressed on a nearby cell. Antibody Fc variants that bind more tightly to Fc ligands may thus more effectively cluster the signaling target and lead to enhanced induction of apoptosis. Such a mechanism could be tested experimentally by adding antibody with and without enhanced Fc ligand binding to cells expressing the desired target that signals and or adding an Fc receptor and a corresponding antibody that will cluster the Fc receptor. Alternative means for clustering Fc receptor include immobilization on beads and over expression in a non effector cell line. After allowing apoptosis to occur measurement of the relative apoptosis of target expressing cells would enable a quantitiative determination of the effect.

Antibodies that cause cell death through their interaction with targets may have an additional benefit. The signals released by such dying cells attract macrophages and other cells of the immune system. These cells can then takeup the dead or dying cells in an antibody mediated manner. This has been shown to result in cross presentation of antigen and the potential for a host immune response against the target cells. Such auto antibodies in response to antibody therapy have been reported for the antigen targets Her2 and CD20. For this reason it may be advantageous to have Fc variants with altered receptor specificities to specifically stimulate cross presentation and an immune response rather than the undesired effect of tolerance induction.

Other therapeutic antibodies exert their effects by inhibiting interaction between a receptor and it s cognate ligand ultimately blocking signaling of the receptor. Such antibodies are used to treat many disease states. In this case it may be advantageous to utilize antibodies that do not recruit any host immune functions. A secondary effect of such an antibody may be actually inducing signalling itself through receptor clustering. In this case the desired therapeutic effect of blocking signaling would be abrogated by antibody mediated signaling. As discussed above this clustering may be enhanced by antibody interaction with cells containing an Fc receptor. In this case use of an Fc variant that binds less tightly or not at all to the Fc receptor would be preferable. Such an antibody would not mediate signaling and its mechanism of action would thereby be restricted to blockage of receptor ligand interactions. Signaling receptors for which this would be most appropriate would likely be monomeric receptors which can only be dimerized but not substantially clustered by a primary antibody. Mulitimeric receptors may be significantly clustered by the primary antibody and may not require additional clustering by Fc receptor binding.

Another potential mechanism of action of therapeutic antibodies is receptor downregulation. Such may be the case for example with the insulin like growth factor receptor. Cell growth depends on continued signaling through the receptor whereas in its absence cells cease to grow. One effect of antibodies directed against this receptor is to downregulate its expression and thereby ablate signaling. Cell recovery from cytotoxic therapy requires stimulation of this receptor. Downregulation of this receptor prevents these cells from recovery and renders the cytotoxic therapy substantially more effective. For antibodies for which this is the primary mechanism of action decreased Fc receptor binding may prevent the sequestration of antibody by nontarget binding to Fc receptors.

Although many therapeutically effective antibodies work in part by signaling through their target antigen this is not always the case. For example some target classes such as cell surface glycoforms do not generate any biological signal. However altered glycoforms are often associated with disease states such as cancer. In other cases interaction of antibodies with different epitopes of the same target antigen may confer different signaling effects. In such cases where this is little or no elicited signaling by binding of antibody or Fc fusion to target antigen Fc polypeptides of the present invention may find utility in providing novel mechanisms of efficacy for otherwise non efficacious molecules.

One approach that has been taken in generating therapeutic antibodies to such nonsignaling targets is to couple the antibody to a cytotoxic agent such as a radio isotope toxin or an enzyme that will process a substrate to produce a cytotoxic agent in the vicinity of the tumor. As an alternative to a cytotoxic moiety Fc variants of the present invention may provide increased recruitment of immune functions that are inherently less toxic to the host while still effective at destroying target cancer cells. Such Fc variants may for example be more efficient at recruiting NK cells or at activating phagocytosis or initiating CDC. Alternatively if a cytotoxic agent is utilized it may be advantageous to use an Fc variant that provides reduced or altered Fc ligand binding. This may reduce or ablate the cytotoxic effects of the agent on immune cells that express Fc receptors thereby reducing toxicity to the patient. Furthermore reduction of Fc ligand binding may help to minimize the generation of an immune response to the toxic agent or enzyme. As mentioned above cell death may result in recruitment of host immune cells antibody mediated cross presentation in such a case may be increased with immune response rather than immune tolerance if in addition to a cytotoxic moiety the therapeutic antibody has increased Fc receptor binding affinity or altered receptor specificity.

Another significant target type are those targets that internalize either as a normal part of their biological function or in response to antibody binding. For such targets many efforts have been made to couple cytotoxic agents such as RNase ricin and calicheamicin which can only exert their effect after internalization. For such reagents Fc ligand binding may reduce efficacy due to nonproductive sequestration of the therapeutic by Fc ligands. In this case it may be advantageous to utilize Fc variants that provide decreased Fc ligand affinity. Conversely antibody pre association with Fc ligands prior to their binding to target antigen presented on cells may serve to inhibit internalization of the target. In this case increased Fc ligand affinity may serve to improve pre association and thereby recruitment of effector cells and the host immune response.

In the case of targets that are soluble rather than cell surface bound recruitment of effector functions would not result directly in cell death. However there may be utility in stimulating the generation of host antibodies to the target. For some disease states successful treatment may require administration of the therapeutic antibody for extremely long periods of time. Such therapy may be prohibitively costly or cumbersome. In these cases stimulation of the host immune response and the generation of antibodies may result in improved efficacy of the therapeutic. This may be applicable as an adjuvant to vaccine therapy. Antibody Fc variants that mediate such an effect may have increased affinity for Fc ligands or altered Fc ligand specificity.

The Fc polypeptides of the present invention may be incorporated into the aforementioned clinical candidates and products or into antibodies and Fc fusions that are substantially similar to them. The Fc polypeptides of the present invention may be incorporated into versions of the aforementioned clinical candidates and products that are humanized affinity matured engineered or modified in some other way. Furthermore the entire polypeptide of the aforementioned clinical products and candidates need not be used to construct a new antibody or Fc fusion that incorporates the Fc polypeptides of the present invention for example only the variable region of a clinical product or candidate antibody a substantially similar variable region or a humanized affinity matured engineered or modified version of the variable region may be used. In another embodiment the Fc polypeptides of the present invention may find use in an antibody or Fc fusion that binds to the same epitope antigen ligand or receptor as one of the aforementioned clinical products and candidates.

In one embodiment the Fc polypeptides of the present invention are used for the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory or transplant indications. Target antigens and clinical products and candidates that are relevant for such diseases include but are not limited to anti 4 7 integrin antibodies such as LDP 02 anti beta2 integrin antibodies such as LDP 01 anti complement C5 antibodies such as 5G1.1 anti CD2 antibodies such as BTI 322 MEDI 507 anti CD3 antibodies such as OKT3 SMART anti CD3 anti CD4 antibodies such as IDEC 151 MDX CD4 OKT4A anti CD11a antibodies anti CD14 antibodies such as IC14 anti CD18 antibodies anti CD23 antibodies such as IDEC 152 anti CD25 antibodies such as Zenapax anti CD40L antibodies such as 5c8 Antova IDEC 131 anti CD64 antibodies such as MDX 33 anti CD80 antibodies such as IDEC 114 anti CD147 antibodies such as ABX CBL anti E selectin antibodies such as CDP850 anti gpIIb IIIa antibodies such as ReoPro Abcixima anti ICAM 3 antibodies such as ICM3 anti ICE antibodies such as VX 740 anti FcR1 antibodies such as MDX 33 anti IgE antibodies such as rhuMab E25 anti IL 4 antibodies such as SB 240683 anti IL 5 antibodies such as SB 240563 SCH55700 anti IL 8 antibodies such as ABX IL8 anti interferon gamma antibodies anti TNF TNF TNF TNFa TNF alpha antibodies such as CDP571 CDP870 D2E7 Infliximab MAK 195F and anti VLA 4 antibodies such as Antegren.

Fc variants of the present invention may be utilized in TNF inhibitor molecules to provide enhanced properties. It has been shown that the effector function associated with Fc RIIIa may negatively impact the effectiveness of certain TNF inhibitor molecules used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis patients that have a high affinity polymorphism 158 F V discussed herein elsewhere and vice versa Z. Tutuncu et al. 2004 FcR Polymorphisms and Treatment Outcomes in Patients with Inflammatory Arthritis Treated with TNF Blocking Agents oral presentation on Oct. 18 2004 at the 2004 ACR Meeting San Antonio Tex. abstract published in Arthritis Rheumatism September 2004 incorporated by reference . In general for autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis combining a TNF inhibitor with an Fc variant that provides reduced binding to one or more Fc Rs as compared to the parent enhances the effectiveness of therapy. Ideally reduced or even ablated binding to one or more Fc Rs for example Fc RIIIa with a TNF inhibitor molecule would produce the best results.

Useful TNF inhibitor molecules include any molecule that inhibits the action of TNF alpha in a mammal. Suitable examples include the Fc fusion Enbrel etanercept and the antibodies Humira adalimumab and Remicade infliximab . Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade and Humira engineered using the Fc variants of the present invention to reduce Fc binding may translate to better efficacy. Effector function of Humira Remicade and Enbrel was not considered in the development of these drugs let alone modulation of effector function. By using an Fc variant of the present invention that reduces binding to one or more Fc Rs in the context of an antibody or Fc fusion that acts on autoimmune conditions efficacy may be enhanced as compared to the currently commercialized products. Useful TNF inhibitor molecules preferably include Dominant Negative TNF molecules as defined in U.S. Ser. No. 09 798 789 filed Mar. 2 2000 Ser. No. 09 981 289 filed Oct. 15 2001 Ser. No. 10 262 630 filed Sep. 30 2002 and Ser. No. 10 963 994 filed Oct. 12 2004 all incorporated by reference . The Dominant Negative TNF molecules DN TNF have no intrinsic effector activity and act to save transmembrane TNF tmTNF i.e. if the killing of cells that contain tmTNF has a negative effect on disease outcome for rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis . A DN TNF molecule associated with an Fc variant that reduces or ablates Fc R binding to the receptor is preferred.

In one embodiment the Fc polypeptides of the present invention function therapeutically in whole or in part through ADCC activity. Target antigens and clinical products and candidates that are relevant for such application may include but are not limited to anti CD20 antibodies such as Bexocar Rituxan Zevalin and PRO70769 anti CD33 antibodies such as Smart M195 anti CD22 antibodies such as Lymphocide anti CD30 antibodies such as AC 10 and SGN 30 anti EGFR antibodies such as ABX EGF Cetuximab IMC C225 Merck Mab 425 anti EpCAM antibodies such as Crucell s anti EpCAM anti HER2 antibodies such as Herceptin and MDX 210 and anti CEA antibodies such as cantumab and Pentacea.

In one embodiment the Fc polypeptides of the present invention function therapeutically in whole or in part through CDC activity. Target antigens and clinical products and candidates that are relevant for such application may include but are not limited to anti CEA antibodies such as cantumab and Pentacea anti CD20 antibodies such as Bexocar Rituxan Zevalin and PRO70769 anti EpCAM antibodies such as Crucell s anti EpCAM and Edrecolomab and anti CD52 antibodies such as Campath alemtuzumab .

In one embodiment the Fc polypeptides of the present invention are directed against antigens expressed in the hematological lineage. Target antigens and clinical products and candidates that are relevant for such application may include but are not limited to anti CD33 antibodies such as Smart M195 anti CD40L antibodies such as Antova IDEC 131 anti CD44 antibodies such as Blvatuzumab anti CD52 antibodies such as Campath alemtuzumab anti CD80 antibodies such as IDEC 114 anti CTLA 4 antibodies such as MDX 101 anti CD20 antibodies such as Bexocar Rituxan Zevalin and PRO70769 anti CD22 antibodies such as Lymphocide anti CD23 antibodies such as IDEC 152 anti CD25 antibodies such as Zenapax daclizumab and anti MHC HLA DR antibodies such as apolizumab.

In a preferred embodiment the target of the Fc variants of the present invention is itself one or more Fc ligands. Fc polypeptides of the invention can be utilized to modulate the activity of the immune system and in some cases to mimic the effects of IVIg therapy in a more controlled specific and efficient manner. IVIg is effectively a high dose of immunoglobulins delivered intravenously. In general IVIg has been used to downregulate autoimmune conditions. It has been hypothesized that the therapeutic mechanism of action of IVIg involves ligation of Fc receptors at high frequency J. Bayry et al. 2003 Transfusion Clinique et Biologique 10 165 169 Binstadt et al. 2003 J Allergy Clin. Immunol 697 704 . Indeed animal models of Ithrombocytopenia purpura ITP show that the isolated Fc are the active portion of IVIg Samuelsson et al 2001 Pediatric Research 50 5 551 . For use in therapy iimmunoglobulins are harvested from thousands of donors with all of the concomitant problems associated with non recombinant biotherapeutics collected from humans. An Fc variant of the present invention should serve all of the roles of IVIg while being manufactured as a recombinant protein rather than harvested from donors.

The immunomodulatory effects of IVIg may be dependent on productive interaction with one or more Fc ligands including but not limited to Fc Rs complement proteins and FcRn. In some embodiments Fc variants of the invention with enhanced affinity for Fc RIIb can be used to promote anti inflammatory activity Samuelsson et al. 2001 291 484 486 and or to reduce autoimmunity Hogarth 2002 14 798 802 . In other embodiments Fc polypeptides of the invention with enhanced affinity for one or more Fc Rs can be utilized by themselves or in combination with additional modifications to reduce autoimmunity Hogarth 2002 14 798 802 . In alternative embodiments Fc variants of the invention with enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIa but reduced capacity for intracellular signaling can be used to reduce immune system activation by competitively interfering with Fc RIIIa binding. The context of the Fc variant dramatically impacts the desired specificity. For example Fc variants that provide enhanced binding to one or more activating Fc Rs may provide optimal immunomodulatory effects in the context of an antibody Fc fusion isolated Fc or Fc fragment by acting as an Fc R antagonist van Mirre et al. 2004 J. Immunol. 173 332 339 . However fusion or conjugation of two or more Fc variants may provide different effects and for such an Fc polypeptide it may be optimal to utilize Fc variants that provide enhanced affinity for an inhibitory receptor.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be used as immunomodulatory therapeutics. Binding to or blocking Fc receptors on immune system cells may be used to influence immune response in immunological conditions including but not limited to idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura ITP and rheumatoid arthritis RA among others. By use of the affinity enhanced Fc variants of the present invention the dosages required in typical IVIg applications may be reduced while obtaining a substantially similar therapeutic effect. The Fc variants may provide enhanced binding to an Fc R including but not limited to Fc RIIa Fc RIIb Fc RIIIa Fc RIIIb and or Fc RI. In particular binding enhancements to Fc RIIb would increase expression or inhibitory activity as needed of that receptor and improve efficacy. Alternatively blocking binding to activation receptors such as Fc RIIIb or Fc RI may improve efficacy. In addition modulated affinity of the Fc variants for FcRn and or also complement may also provide benefits.

In one embodiment Fc variants that provide enhanced binding to the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb provide an enhancement to the IVIg therapeutic approach. In particular the Fc variants of the present invention that bind with greater affinity to the Fc RIIb receptor than parent Fc polypeptide may be used. Such Fc variants would thus function as Fc RIIb agonists and woulld be expected to enhance the beneficial effects of IVIg as an autoimmune disease therapeutic and also as a modulator of B cell proliferation. In addition such Fc RIIb enhanced Fc variants may also be further modified to have the same or limited binding to other receptors. In additional embodiments the Fc variants with enhanced Fc RIIb affinity may be combined with mutations that reduce or ablate to other receptors thereby potentially further minimizing side effects during therapeutic use.

Such immunomodulatory applications of the Fc variants of the present invention may also be utilized in the treatment of oncological indications especially those for which antibody therapy involves antibody dependant cytotoxic mechanisms. For example an Fc variant that enhances affinity to Fc RIIb may be used to antagonize this inhibitory receptor for example by binding to the Fc Fc RIIb binding site but failing to trigger or reducing cell signaling potentially enhancing the effect of antibody based anti cancer therapy. Such Fc variants functioning as Fc RIIb antagonists may either block the inhibitory properties of Fc RIIb or induce its inhibitory function as in the case of IVIg. An Fc RIIb antagonist may be used as co therapy in combination with any other therapeutic including but not limited to antibodies acting on the basis of ADCC related cytotoxicity. Fc RIIb antagonistic Fc variants of this type are preferably isolated Fc or Fc fragments although in alternate embodiments antibodies and Fc fusions may be used.

The present invention provides Fc variants that are optimized for a number of therapeutically relevant properties. An Fc variant comprises one or more amino acid modifications relative to a parent Fc polypeptide wherein said amino acid modification s provide one or more optimized properties. An Fc variant of the present invention differs in amino acid sequence from its parent Fc polypeptide by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Thus Fc variants of the present invention have at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent. Alternatively the Fc variants of the present invention may have more than one amino acid modification as compared to the parent for example from about one to fifty amino acid modifications preferrably from about one to ten amino acid modifications and most preferably from about one to about five amino acid modifications compared to the parent. Thus the sequences of the Fc variants and those of the parent Fc polypeptide are substantially homologous. For example the variant Fc variant sequences herein will possess about 80 homology with the parent Fc variant sequence preferably at least about 90 homology and most preferably at least about 95 homology.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be optimized for a variety of properties. An Fc variant that is engineered or predicted to display one or more optimized properties is herein referred to as an optimized Fc variant . Properties that may be optimized include but are not limited to enhanced or reduced affinity for an Fc R. In a preferred embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to possess enhanced affinity for a human activating Fc R preferably Fc RI Fc RIIa Fc RIIc Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIIb most preferably Fc RIIIa. In an alternately preferred embodiment the Fc variants are optimized to possess reduced affinity for the human inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide Fc polypeptides with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans for example enhanced effector function and greater anti cancer potency. In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to have reduced or ablated affinity for a human Fc R including but not limited to Fc RI Fc RIIa Fc RIIb Fc RIIc Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIIb. These embodiments are anticipated to provide Fc polypeptides with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans for example reduced effector function and reduced toxicity. In other embodiments Fc variants of the present invention provide enhanced affinity for one or more Fc Rs yet reduced affinity for one or more other Fc Rs. For example an Fc variant of the present invention may have enhanced binding to Fc RIIIa yet reduced binding to Fc RIIb. Alternately an Fc variant of the present invention may have enhanced binding to Fc RIIa and Fc RI yet reduced binding to Fc RIIb. In yet another embodiment an Fc variant of the present invention may have enhanced affinity for Fc RIIb yet reduced affinity to one or more activating Fc Rs.

Preferred embodiments comprise optimization of Fc binding to a human Fc R however in alternate embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention possess enhanced or reduced affinity for Fc Rs from nonhuman organisms including but not limited to rodents and non human primates. Fc variants that are optimized for binding to a nonhuman Fc R may find use in experimentation. For example mouse models are available for a variety of diseases that enable testing of properties such as efficacy toxicity and pharmacokinetics for a given drug candidate. As is known in the art cancer cells can be grafted or injected into mice to mimic a human cancer a process referred to as xenografting. Testing of Fc variants that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse Fc Rs may provide valuable information with regard to the efficacy of the protein its mechanism of action and the like. The Fc variants of the present invention may also be optimized for enhanced functionality and or solution properties in aglycosylated form. In a preferred embodiment the aglycosylated Fc variants of the present invention bind an Fc ligand with greater affinity than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc variant. Said Fc ligands include but are not limited to Fc Rs C1q FcRn and proteins A and G and may be from any source including but not limited to human mouse rat rabbit or monkey preferably human. In an alternately preferred embodiment the Fc variants are optimized to be more stable and or more soluble than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc variant.

Fc variants of the invention may comprise modifications that modulate interaction with Fc ligands other than Fc Rs including but not limited to complement proteins FcRn and Fc receptor homologs FcRHs . FcRHs include but are not limited to FcRH1 FcRH2 FcRH3 FcRH4 FcRH5 and FcRH6 Davis et al. 2002 Immunol. Reviews 190 123 136 .

Preferably the Fc ligand specificity of the Fc variant of the present invention will determine its therapeutic utility. The utility of a given Fc variant for therapeutic purposes will depend on the epitope or form of the Target antigen and the disease or indication being treated. For some targets and indications enhanced Fc R mediated effector functions may be preferable. This may be particularly favorable for anti cancer Fc variants. Thus Fc variants may be used that comprise Fc variants that provide enhanced affinity for activating Fc Rs and or reduced affinity for inhibitory Fc Rs. For some targets and indications it may be further beneficial to utilize Fc variants that provide differential selectivity for different activating Fc Rs for example in some cases enhanced binding to Fc RIIa and Fc RIIIa may be desired but not Fc RI whereas in other cases enhanced binding only to Fc RIIa may be preferred. For certain targets and indications it may be preferable to utilize Fc variants that enhance both Fc R mediated and complement mediated effector functions whereas for other cases it may be advantageous to utilize Fc variants that enhance either Fc R mediated or complement mediated effector functions. For some Targets or cancer indications it may be advantageous to reduce or ablate one or more effector functions for example by knocking out binding to C1q one or more Fc R s FcRn or one or more other Fc ligands. For other targets and indications it may be preferable to utilize Fc variants that provide enhanced binding to the inhibitory Fc RIIb yet WT level reduced or ablated binding to activating Fc Rs. This may be particularly useful for example when the goal of an Fc variant is to inhibit inflammation or auto immune disease or modulate the immune system in some way.

Clearly an important parameter that determines the most beneficial selectivity of a given Fc variant to treat a given disease is the context of the Fc variant that is what type of Fc variant is being used. Thus the Fc ligand selectivity or specificity of a given Fc variant will provide different properties depending on whether it composes an antibody Fc fusion or an Fc variants with a coupled fusion or conjugate partner. For example toxin radionucleotide or other conjugates may be less toxic to normal cells if the Fc variant that comprises them has reduced or ablated binding to one or more Fc ligands. As another example in order to inhibit inflammation or auto immune disease it may be preferable to utilize an Fc variant with enhanced affinity for activating Fc Rs such as to bind these Fc Rs and prevent their activation. Conversely an Fc variant that comprises two or more Fc regions with enhanced Fc RIIb affinity may co engage this receptor on the surface of immune cells thereby inhibiting proliferation of these cells. Whereas in some cases an Fc variants may engage its target antigen on one cell type yet engage Fc Rs on separate cells from the target antigen in other cases it may be advantageous to engage Fc Rs on the surface of the same cells as the target antigen. For example if an antibody targets an antigen on a cell that also expresses one or more Fc Rs it may be beneficial to utilize an Fc variant that enhances or reduces binding to the Fc Rs on the surface of that cell. This may be the case for example when the Fc variant is being used as an anti cancer agent and co engagement of target antigen and Fc R on the surface of the same cell promote signaling events within the cell that result in growth inhibition apoptosis or other anti proliferative effect. Alternatively antigen and Fc R co engagement on the same cell may be advantageous when the Fc variant is being used to modulate the immune system in some way wherein co engagement of target antigen and Fc R provides some proliferative or anti proliferative effect. Likewise Fc variants that comprise two or more Fc regions may benefit from Fc variants that modulate Fc R selectivity or specificity to co engage Fc Rs on the surface of the same cell.

The Fc ligand specificity of the Fc variants of the present invention can be modulated to create different effector function profiles that may be suited for particular target antigens indications or patient populations. Table 1 describes several preferred embodiments of receptor binding profiles that include improvements to reductions to or no effect to the binding to various receptors where such changes may be beneficial in certain contexts. The receptor binding profiles in the table could be varied by degree of increase or decrease to the specified receptors. Additionally the binding changes specified could be in the context of additional binding changes to other receptors such as C1q or FcRn for example by combining with ablation of binding to C1q to shut off complement activation or by combining with enhanced binding to C1q to increase complement activation. Other embodiments with other receptor binding profiles are possible the listed receptor binding profiles are exemplary.

The presence of different polymorphic forms of Fc Rs provides yet another parameter that impacts the therapeutic utility of the Fc variants of the present invention. Whereas the specificity and selectivity of a given Fc variant for the different classes of Fc Rs signficantly affects the capacity of an Fc variant to target a given antigen for treatment of a given disease the specificity or selectivity of an Fc variant for different polymorphic forms of these receptors may in part determine which research or pre clinical experiments may be appropriate for testing and ultimately which patient populations may or may not respond to treatment. Thus the specificity or selecitivty of Fc variants of the present invention to Fc ligand polymorphisms including but not limited to Fc R C1q FcRn and FcRH polymorphisms may be used to guide the selection of valid research and pre clinical experiments clinical trial design patient selection dosing dependence and or other aspects concerning clinical trials.

In addition to comprising an Fc variant of the present invention the Fc polypeptides of the present invention may comprise one or more additional modifications. Said modifications may be amino acid modifications or may modifications that are not amino acid modifications such as modifications that are made enzymatically or chemically. Combinations of additional amino acid modifications and modifications that are not amino acid modifications are contemplated. Such additional modification s likely provide some improvement in the Fc polypeptide for example an enhancement in its stability solubility function or clinical use. The present invention contemplates a variety of improvements that made be made by coupling the Fc variants of the present invention with additional modifications.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other amino acid modifications in the Fc region that provide altered or optimized interaction with one or more Fc ligands including but not limited to Fc Rs C1q or other complement proteins FcRn FcR homologues FcRHs and or as yet undiscovered Fc ligands. It is noted that Fc polypeptides of the present invention may themselves have as yet unknown useful interaction properties with one or more Fc ligands for example FcRHs. Additional modifications may provide altered or optimized affinity and or specificity to the Fc ligands. Additional modifications may provide altered or optimized effector functions including but not limited to ADCC ADCP CDC and or serum half life. Such combination may provide additive synergistic or novel properties. In one embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with known Fc variants Duncan et al. 1988 332 563 564 Lund et al. 1991 147 2657 2662 Lund et al. 1992 29 53 59 Alegre et al. 1994 57 1537 1543 Hutchins et al. 1995 92 11980 11984 Jefferis et al. 1995 44 111 117 Lund et al. 1995 9 115 119 Jefferis et al. 1996 54 101 104 Lund et al. 1996 157 4963 4969 Armour et al. 1999 29 2613 2624 Idusogie et al. 2000 164 4178 4184 Reddy et al. 2000 164 1925 1933 Xu et al. 2000 200 16 26 Idusogie et al. 2001 166 2571 2575 Shields et al. 2001 276 6591 6604 Jefferis et al. 2002 82 57 65 Presta et al. 2002 30 487 490 Hinton et al. 2004 279 6213 6216 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 U.S. Pat. No. 5 885 573 U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551 PCT WO 00 42072 PCT WO 99 58572 US 2004 0002587 A1 U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 PCT US2004 000643 U.S. Ser. No. 10 370 749 and PCT US2004 005112 all incorporated by reference. For example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 PCT US2004 000643 U.S. Ser. No. 10 370 749 and PCT US2004 005112 the substitutions S298A S298D K326E K326D E333A K334A and P396L provide optimized Fc R binding and or enhanced ADCC. Furthermore as disclosed in Idusogie et al. 2001 J. Immunology 166 2571 2572 incorporated by reference substitutions K326W K326Y and E333S provide enhanced binding to the complement protein C1q and enhanced CDC. Finally as described in Hinton et al. 2004 J. Biol. Chem. 279 8 6213 6216 incorporated by reference substitutions T250Q T250E M428L and M428F provide enhanced binding to FcRn and improved pharmacokinetics.

Because the binding sites for Fc Rs C1q and FcRn reside in the Fc region the differences between the IgGs in the Fc region are likely to contribute to differences in Fc R and C1q mediated effector functions. It is also possible that the modifications can be made in other non Fc regions of an Fc variant including for example the Fab and hinge regions of an antibody or the Fc fusion partner of an Fc fusion. For example as disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 11 090 981 hereby incorporated by reference the Fab and hinge regions of an antibody may impact effector functions such as antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC antibody dependent cell mediated phagocytosis ADCP and complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . Thus modifications outside the Fc region of an Fc variant of the present invention are contemplated. For example antibodies of the present invention may comprise one or more amino acid modifications in the V C V C1 and or hinge regions of an antibody.

Other modifications may provide additional or novel binding determinants into an Fc variant for example additional or novel Fc receptor binding sites for example as described in U.S. Ser. No. 60 531 752 filed Dec. 22 2003 entitled Fc variants with novel Fc receptor binding sites . In one embodiment an Fc variant of one antibody isotype may be engineered such that it binds to an Fc receptor of a different isotype. This may be particularly applicable when the Fc binding sites for the respective Fc receptors do not significantly overlap. For example the structural determinants of IgA binding to Fc RI may be engineered into an IgG Fc variant.

The Fc variants of the present invention may comprise modifications that modulate the in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of an Fc variant. These include but are not limited to modifications that enhance affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn U.S. Ser. No. 10 020 354 WO2001US0048432 EP2001000997063 U.S. Pat. No. 6 277 375 U.S. Ser. No. 09 933 497 WO1997US0003321 U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 WO2000US0000973 Shields et al. 2001 J Biol Chem 276 9 6591 6604 Zhou et al. 2003 J Mol Biol. 332 901 913 . These further include modifications that modify FcRn affinity in a pH specific manner. In some embodiments where enhanced in vivo half life is desired modifications that specifically enhance FcRn affinity at lower pH 5.5 6 relative to higher pH 7 8 are preferred Hinton et al. 2004 J Biol Chem 279 8 6213 6216 Dall Acqua et al. 2002 J Immuno 169 5171 5180 Ghetie et al. 1997 Nat Biotechnol 15 7 637 640 WO2003US0033037 WO2004US0011213 . For example as described in Hinton et al. 2004 Engineered Human IgG Antibodies with Longer Serum Half lives in Primates J Biol Chem 279 8 6213 6216 substitutions T250Q T250E M428L and M428F provide enhanced binding to FcRn and improved pharmacokinetics. Additionally preferred modifications are those that maintain the wild type Fc s improved binding at lower pH relative to the higher pH. In alternative embodiments where rapid in vivo clearance is desired modifications that reduce affinity for FcRn are preferred. U.S. Pat. No. 6 165 745 WO1993US0003895 EP1993000910800 WO1997US0021437 Medesan et al. 1997 J Immunol 158 5 2211 2217 Ghetie Ward 2000 Annu Rev Immunol 18 739 766 Martin et al. 2001 Molecular Cell 7 867 877 Kim et al. 1999 Eur J Immunol 29 2819 2825 . Preferred variants that enhance FcRn are described in U.S. Ser. No. 60 627 763 filed Nov. 12 2004 Ser. No. 60 642 886 filed Jan. 11 2005 Ser. No. 60 649 508 filed Feb. 2 2005 Ser.

Additional modifications may comprise amino acid modifications wherein residues in an Fc polypeptide are modified to the corresponding residue in a homologous Fc polypeptide. Effector functions such as ADCC ADCP CDC and serum half life differ significantly between the different classes of antibodies including for example human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 IgA2 IgD IgE IgG and IgM references Michaelsen et al. 1992 Molecular Immunology 29 3 319 326 . Human IgG1 is the most commonly used antibody for therapeutic purposes and engineering studies wherein variants have been constructed that show enhanced effector function have been carried out predominantly in this context. As described above it is possible to determine corresponding or equivalent residues in Fc polypeptides that have significant sequence or structural homology with each other. By the same token it is possible to use such methods to engineer additional amino acid modifications in an Fc polypeptide to provide additional optimized properties for example as described in U.S. Ser. No. 60 621 387 filed Oct. 21 2004. In one embodiment amino acid modifications can be made that replace one or more residues in an Fc polypeptide of the present invention with one or more residues in another homologous Fc polypeptide. In an alternate embodiment hybrid Fc polypeptides are constructed such that one or more regions of an Fc polypeptide of the present invention are replace with the corresponding regions of a homolous Fc polypeptide. For example some studies have explored IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4 variants in order to investigate the determinants of the effector function differences between them. See for example Canfield Morrison 1991 J Exp Med 173 1483 1491 Chappel et al. 1991 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88 20 9036 9040 Chappel et al. 1993 J Biol Chem 268 25124 25131 Tao Canfield and Morrison 1991 J Exp Med 173 1025 1028 Tao et al. 1993 J Exp Med 178 661 667 Redpath et al. 1998 Human Immunology 59 720 727.

In one embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention comprise one or more engineered glycoforms. By engineered glycoform as used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to an Fc variant wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent Fc variant. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by a variety of methods known in the art Umana et al. 1999 17 176 180 Davies et al. 2001 74 288 294 Shields et al. 2002 277 26733 26740 Shinkawa et al. 2003 278 3466 3473 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 U.S. Ser. No. 10 277 370 U.S. Ser. No. 10 113 929 PCT WO 00 61739A1 PCT WO 01 29246A1 PCT WO 02 31140A1 PCT WO 02 30954A1 Potelligent technology Biowa Inc. Princeton N.J. GlycoMAb glycosylation engineering technology GLYCART biotechnology AG Z rich Switzerland . Many of these techniques are based on controlling the level of fucosylated and or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region for example by expressing an Fc variant in various organisms or cell lines engineered or otherwise for example Lec 13 CHO cells or rat hybridoma YB2 0 cells by regulating enzymes involved in the glycosylation pathway for example FUT8 1 6 fucosyltranserase and or 1 4 N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnTIII or by modifying carbohydrate s after the Fc variant has been expressed. Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide thus an Fc variant for example an antibody or Fc fusion may comprise an engineered glycoform. Alternatively engineered glycoform may refer to the Fc variant that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide.

Fc variants of the present invention may comprise one or more modifications that provide optimized properties that are not specifically related to effector function per se. Said modifications may be amino acid modifications or may be modifications that are made enzymatically or chemically. Such modification s likely provide some improvement in the Fc variant for example an enhancement in its stability solubility function or clinical use. The present invention contemplates a variety of improvements that made be made by coupling the Fc variants of the present invention with additional modifications.

In a preferred embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention may comprise modifications to reduce immunogenicity in humans. In a most preferred embodiment the immunogenicity of an Fc variant of the present invention is reduced using a method described in U.S. Ser. No. 11 004 590 filed Dec. 3 2004 entitled Methods of Generating Variant Proteins with Increased Host String Content and Compositions Thereof . In alternate embodiments the antibodies of the present invention are humanized Clark 2000 21 397 402 . By humanized antibody as used herein is meant an antibody comprising a human framework region FR and one or more complementarity determining regions CDR s from a non human usually mouse or rat antibody. The non human antibody providing the CDR s is called the donor and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the acceptor . Humanization relies principally on the grafting of donor CDRs onto acceptor human Vand Vframeworks Winter U.S. Pat. No. 5 225 539 . This strategy is referred to as CDR grafting . Backmutation of selected acceptor framework residues to the corresponding donor residues is often required to regain affinity that is lost in the initial grafted construct U.S. Pat. No. 5 530 101 U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 U.S. Pat. No. 5 693 761 U.S. Pat. No. 5 693 762 U.S. Pat. No. 6 180 370 U.S. Pat. No. 5 859 205 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 U.S. Pat. No. 6 054 297 U.S. Pat. No. 6 407 213 . The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region typically that of a human immunoglobulin and thus will typically comprise a human Fc region. A variety of techniques and methods for humanizing and reshaping non human antibodies are well known in the art See Tsurushita Vasquez 2004 Humanization of Monoclonal Antibodies Molecular Biology of B Cells 533 545 Elsevier Science USA and references cited therein . Humanization methods include but are not limited to methods described in Jones et al. 1986 321 522 525 Riechmann et al. 1988 332 323 329 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 239 1534 1536 Queen et al. 1989 86 10029 33 He et al. 1998 J Immunol 160 1029 1035 Carter et al. 1992 89 4285 9 Presta et al. 1997 Cancer Res 57 20 4593 9 Gorman et al. 1991 Proc Natl Acad Sci. USA 88 4181 4185 O Connor et al. 1998 11 321 8. Humanization or other methods of reducing the immunogenicity of nonhuman antibody variable regions may include resurfacing methods as described for example in Roguska et al. 1994 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91 969 973. In one embodiment selection based methods may be employed to humanize and or affinity mature antibody variable regions including but not limited to methods described in Wu et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 294 151 162 Baca et al. 1997 J. Biol. Chem. 272 16 10678 10684 Rosok et al. 1996 J. Biol. Chem. 271 37 22611 22618 Rader et al. 1998 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 8910 8915 Krauss et al. 2003 Protein Engineering 16 10 753 759. Other humanization methods may involve the grafting of only parts of the CDRs including but not limited to methods described in U.S. Ser. No. 09 810 502 Tan et al. 2002 J. Immunol. 169 1119 1125 De Pascalis et al. 2002 J. Immunol. 169 3076 3084. Structure based methods may be employed for humanization and affinity maturation for example as described in U.S. Ser. No. 10 153 159 and related applications.

Modifications to reduce immunogenicity may include modifications that reduce binding of processed peptides derived from the parent sequence to MHC proteins. For example amino acid modifications would be engineered such that there are no or a minimal number of immune epitopes that are predicted to bind with high affinity to any prevalent MHC alleles. Several methods of identifying MHC binding epitopes in protein sequences are known in the art and may be used to score epitopes in an Fc variant of the present invention. See for example WO 98 52976 WO 02 079232 WO 00 3317 U.S. Ser. No. 09 903 378 U.S. Ser. No. 10 039 170 U.S. Ser. No. 60 222 697 U.S. Ser. No. 10 339788 PCT WO 01 21823 and PCT WO 02 00165 Mallios 1999 15 432 439 Mallios 2001 17 942 948 Sturniolo et al. 1999 17 555 561 WO 98 59244 WO 02 069232 WO 02 77187 Marshall et al. 1995 154 5927 5933 and Hammer et al. 1994 180 2353 2358. Sequence based information can be used to determine a binding score for a given peptide MHC interaction see for example Mallios 1999 15 432 439 Mallios 2001 17 p942 948 Sturniolo et. al. 1999 17 555 561 . It is possible to use structure based methods in which a given peptide is computationally placed in the peptide binding groove of a given MHC molecule and the interaction energy is determined for example see WO 98 59244 and WO 02 069232 . Such methods may be referred to as threading methods. Alternatively purely experimental methods can be used for example a set of overlapping peptides derived from the protein of interest can be experimentally tested for the ability to induce T cell activation and or other aspects of an immune response. see for example WO 02 77187 . In a preferred embodiment MHC binding propensity scores are calculated for each 9 residue frame along the protein sequence using a matrix method see Sturniolo et. al. supra Marshall et. al. 1995 154 5927 5933 and Hammer et. al. 1994 180 2353 2358 . It is also possible to consider scores for only a subset of these residues or to consider also the identities of the peptide residues before and after the 9 residue frame of interest. The matrix comprises binding scores for specific amino acids interacting with the peptide binding pockets in different human class II MHC molecule. In the most preferred embodiment the scores in the matrix are obtained from experimental peptide binding studies. In an alternate preferred embodiment scores for a given amino acid binding to a given pocket are extrapolated from experimentally characterized alleles to additional alleles with identical or similar residues lining that pocket. Matrices that are produced by extrapolation are referred to as virtual matrices . In an alternate embodiment additional amino acid modifications may be engineered to reduce the propensity of the intact molecule to interact with B cell receptors and circulating antibodies.

Antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may comprise amino acid modifications in one or more regions outside the Fc region for example the antibody Fab region or the Fc fusion partner that provide optimal properties. In one embodiment the variable region of an antibody of the present invention may be affinity matured that is to say that amino acid modifications have been made in the Vand or Vdomains of the antibody to enhance binding of the antibody to its target antigen. Likewise modifications may be made in the Fc fusion partner to enhance affinity of the Fc fusion for its target antigen. Such types of modifications may improve the association and or the dissociation kinetics for binding to the target antigen. Other modifications include those that improve selectivity for target antigen vs. alternative targets. These include modifications that improve selectivity for antigen expressed on target vs. non target cells. Other improvements to the target recognition properties may be provided by additional modifications. Such properties may include but are not limited to specific kinetic properties i.e. association and dissociation kinetics selectivity for the particular target versus alternative targets and selectivity for a specific form of target versus alternative forms. Examples include full length versus splice variants aberrant forms of antigens that are expressed only on certain cell types such as tumor cells cell surface vs. soluble forms selectivity for various polymorphic variants or selectivity for specific conformational forms of the target.

Fc variants of the invention may comprise one or more modifications that provide reduced or enhanced internalization of an Fc variant. In one embodiment Fc variants of the present invention can be utilized or combined with additional modifications in order to reduce the cellular internalization of an Fc variant that occurs via interaction with one or more Fc ligands. This property might be expected to enhance effector function and potentially reduce immunogenicity of the Fc variants of the invention. Alternatively Fc variants of the present Fc variants of the present invention can be utilized directly or combined with additional modifications in order to enhance the cellular internalization of an Fc variant that occurs via interaction with one or more Fc ligands. For example in a preferred embodiment an Fc variant is used that provides enhanced binding to Fc RI which is expressed on dendritic cells and active early in immune response. This strategy could be further enhanced by combination with additional modifications either within the Fc variant or in an attached fusion or conjugate partner that promote recognition and presentation of Fc peptide fragments by MHC molecules. These strategies are expected to enhance target antigen processing and thereby improve antigenicity of the target antigen Bonnerot and Amigorena 1999 172 279 84 promoting an adaptive immune response and greater target cell killing by the human immune system. These strategies may be particularly advantageous when the targeted antigen is shed from the cellular surface. An additional application of these concepts arises with idiotype vaccine immunotherapies in which clone specific antibodies produced by a patient s lymphoma cells are used to vaccinate the patient.

In a preferred embodiment modifications are made to improve biophysical properties of the Fc variants of the present invention including but not limited to stability solubility and oligomeric state. Modifications can include for example substitutions that provide more favorable intramolecular interactions in the Fc variant such as to provide greater stability or substitution of exposed nonpolar amino acids with polar amino acids for higher solubility. A number of optimization goals and methods are described in U.S. Ser. No. 10 379 392 that may find use for engineering additional modifications to further optimize the Fc variants of the present invention. The Fc variants of the present invention can also be combined with additional modifications that reduce oligomeric state or size such that tumor penetration is enhanced or in vivo clearance rates are increased as desired.

Other modifications to the Fc variants of the present invention include those that enable the specific formation or homodimeric or homomultimeric molecules. Such modifications include but are not limited to engineered disulfides as well as chemical modifications or aggregation methods which may provide a mechanism for generating covalent homodimeric or homomultimers. For example methods of engineering and compositions of such molecules are described in Kan et al. 2001 2001 166 1320 1326 Stevenson et al. 2002 159 104 12 U.S. Pat. No. 5 681 566 Caron et al. 1992 J Exp Med 176 1191 1195 and Shopes 1992 J Immunol 148 9 2918 22. Additional modifications to the variants of the present invention include those that enable the specific formation or heterodimeric heteromultimeric bifunctional and or multifunctional molecules. Such modifications include but are not limited to one or more amino acid substitutions in the C3 domain in which the substitutions reduce homodimer formation and increase heterodimer formation. For example methods of engineering and compositions of such molecules are described in Atwell et al. 1997 J Mol Biol 270 1 26 35 and Carter et al. 2001 J Immunol Methods 248 7 15. Additional modifications include modifications in the hinge and CH3 domains in which the modifications reduce the propensity to form dimers.

In further embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention comprise modifications that remove proteolytic degradation sites. These may include for example protease sites that reduce production yields as well as protease sites that degrade the administered protein in vivo. In a preferred embodiment additional modifications are made to remove covalent degradation sites such as deamidation i.e. deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues oxidation and proteolytic degradation sites. Deamidation sites that are particular useful to remove are those that have enhance propensity for deamidation including but not limited to asparaginyl and gltuamyl residues followed by glycines NG and QG motifs respectively . In such cases substitution of either residue can significantly reduce the tendancy for deamidation. Common oxidation sites include methionine and cysteine residues. Other covalent modifications that can either be introduced or removed include hydroxylation of proline and lysine phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues methylation of the amino groups of lysine arginine and histidine side chains T. E. Creighton Proteins Structure and Molecular Properties W.H. Freeman Co. San Francisco pp. 79 86 1983 acetylation of the N terminal amine and amidation of any C terminal carboxyl group. Additional modifications also may include but are not limited to posttranslational modifications such as N linked or O linked glycosylation and phosphorylation.

Modifications may include those that improve expression and or purification yields from hosts or host cells commonly used for production of biologics. These include but are not limited to various mammalian cell lines e.g. CHO yeast cell lines bacterial cell lines and plants.

Additional modifications include modifications that remove or reduce the ability of heavy chains to form intra chain disulfide linkages.

The Fc variants of the present invention may comprise modifications that include the use of unnatural amino acids incorporated using for example the technologies developed by Schultz and colleagues including but not limited to methods described by Cropp Shultz 2004 Trends Genet. 20 12 625 30 Anderson et al. 2004 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101 2 7566 71 Zhang et al. 2003 303 5656 371 3 and Chin et al. 2003 Science 301 5635 964 7. In some embodiments these modifications enable manipulation of various functional biophysical immunological or manufacturing properties discussed above.

For example the Fc variant may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers e.g. polyethylene glycol PEG polypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylenes or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. Additional amino acid modifications may be made to enable specific or non specific chemical or posttranslational modification of the Fc variants. Such modifications include but are not limited to PEGylation and glycosylation. Specific substitutions that can be utilized to enable PEGylation include but are not limited to introduction of novel cysteine residues or unnatural amino acids such that efficient and specific coupling chemistries can be used to attach a PEG or otherwise polymeric moiety. Introduction of specific glycosylation sites can be achieved by introducing novel N X T S sequences into the Fc variants of the present invention.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to one or more other molecules or polypeptides. Conjugate and fusion partners may be any molecule including small molecule chemical compounds and polypeptides. For example a variety of antibody conjugates and methods are described in Trail et al. 1999 Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11 584 588. Possible conjugate partners include but are not limited to cytokines cytotoxic agents toxins radioisotopes chemotherapeutic agent anti angiogenic agents a tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other therapeutically active agents. In some embodiments conjugate partners may be thought of more as payloads that is to say that the goal of a conjugate is targeted delivery of the conjugate partner to a targeted cell for example a cancer cell or immune cell by the Fc variant. Thus for example the conjugation of a toxin to an antibody or Fc fusion targets the delivery of said toxin to cells expressing the target antigen.

In one embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are fused or conjugated to a cytokine. By cytokine as used herein is meant a generic term for proteins released by one cell population that act on another cell as intercellular mediators. For example as described in Penichet et al. 2001 J Immunol Methods 248 91 101 cytokines may be fused to antibody to provide an array of desirable properties. Examples of such cytokines are lymphokines monokines and traditional polypeptide hormones. Included among the cytokines are growth hormone such as human growth hormone N methionyl human growth hormone and bovine growth hormone parathyroid hormone thyroxine insulin proinsulin relaxin prorelaxin glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone FSH thyroid stimulating hormone TSH and luteinizing hormone LH hepatic growth factor fibroblast growth factor prolactin placental lactogen tumor necrosis factor alpha and beta mullerian inhibiting substance mouse gonadotropin associated peptide inhibin activin vascular endothelial growth factor integrin thrombopoietin TPO nerve growth factors such as NGF beta platelet growth factor transforming growth factors TGFS such as TGF alpha and TGF beta insulin like growth factor I and II erythropoietin EPO osteoinductive factors interferons such as interferon alpha beta and gamma colony stimulating factors CSFs such as macrophage CSF M CSF granulocyte macrophage CSF GM CSF and granulocyte CSF G CSF interleukins ILs such as IL 1 IL 1alpha IL 2 IL 3 IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 7 IL 8 IL 9 IL 10 IL 11 IL 12 IL 15 a tumor necrosis factor such as TNF alpha or TNF beta C5a and other polypeptide factors including LIF and kit ligand KL . As used herein the term cytokine includes proteins from natural sources or from recombinant cell culture and biologically active equivalents of the native sequence cytokines.

In an alternate embodiment the Fc polypeptides of the present invention are fused conjugated or operably linked to a toxin including but not limited to small molecule toxins and enzymatically active toxins of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin including fragments and or variants thereof. For example a variety of immunotoxins and immunotoxin methods are described in Thrush et al. 1996 Ann. Rev. Immunol. 14 49 71. Small molecule toxins include but are not limited to calicheamicin maytansine U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 trichothene and CC1065. In one embodiment of the invention the Fc polypeptide is conjugated to one or more maytansine molecules e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule . Maytansine may for example be converted to May SS Me which may be reduced to May SH3 and reacted with modified Fc polypeptide Chari et al. 1992 52 127 131 to generate a maytansinoid antibody or maytansinoid Fc fusion conjugate. Another conjugate of interest comprises an Fc polypeptide for example an antibody or Fc fusion conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin that may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. 1993 Cancer Research 53 3336 3342 Lode et al. 1998 Cancer Research 58 2925 2928 U.S. Pat. No. 5 714 586 U.S. Pat. No. 5 712 374 U.S. Pat. No. 5 264 586 U.S. Pat. No. 5 773 001 . Dolastatin 10 analogs such as auristatin E AE and monomethylauristatin E MMAE may find use as conjugates for the Fc variants of the present invention Doronina et al. 2003 Nat Biotechnol 21 7 778 84 Francisco et al. 2003 Blood 102 4 1458 65 . Useful enyzmatically active toxins include but are not limited to diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example PCT WO 93 21232 hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention further contemplates a conjugate between an Fc variant of the present invention and a compound with nucleolytic activity for example a ribonuclease or DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease Dnase .

In an alternate embodiment an Fc variant of the present invention may be fused conjugated or operably linked to a radioisotope to form a radioconjugate. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugate antibodies and Fc fusions. Examples include but are not limited to At211 I131 I125 Y90 Re186 Re188 Sm153 Bi212 P32 and radioactive isotopes of Lu. See for example reference.

In yet another embodiment an Fc variant of the present invention may be conjugated to a receptor e.g. streptavidin for utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the Fc variant receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide . In an alternate embodiment the Fc variant is conjugated or operably linked to an enzyme in order to employ Antibody Dependent Enzyme Mediated Prodrug Therapy ADEPT . ADEPT may be used by conjugating or operably linking the Fc variant to a prodrug activating enzyme that converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent see PCT WO 81 01145 to an active anti cancer drug. See for example PCT WO 88 07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278. The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active cytotoxic form. Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate containing prodrugs into free drugs arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate containing prodrugs into free drugs cytosine deaminase useful for converting non toxic 5 fluorocytosine into the anti cancer drug 5 fluorouracil proteases such as serratia protease thermolysin subtilisin carboxypeptidases and cathepsins such as cathepsins B and L that are useful for converting peptide containing prodrugs into free drugs D alanylcarboxypeptidases useful for converting prodrugs that contain D amino acid substituents carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as .beta. galactosidase and neuramimidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs beta lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with .alpha. lactams into free drugs and penicillin amidases such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups respectively into free drugs. Alternatively antibodies with enzymatic activity also known in the art as abzymes can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs see for example Massey 1987 328 457 458 . Fc variant abzyme conjugates can be prepared for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population. A variety of additional conjugates are contemplated for the Fc variants of the present invention. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents anti angiogenic agents tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other therapeutic agents are described below which may find use as Fc variant conjugates.

Also contemplated as fusion and conjugate partners are Fc polypeptides. Thus an Fc variant may be a multimeric Fc polypeptide comprising two or more Fc regions. The advantage of such a molecule is that it provides multiple binding sites for Fc receptors with a single protein molecule. In one embodiment Fc regions may be linked using a chemical engineering approach. For example Fab s and Fc s may be linked by thioether bonds originating at cysteine residues in the hinges generating molecules such as FabFc Kan et al. 2001 2001 166 1320 1326 Stevenson et al. 2002 159 104 12 U.S. Pat. No. 5 681 566 . Fc regions may be linked using disulfide engineering and or chemical cross linking for example as described in Caron et al. 1992 176 1191 1195 and Shopes 1992 J. Immunol. 148 9 2918 22. In a preferred embodiment Fc regions may be linked genetically. For example multiple C 2 domains have been fused between the Fab and Fc regions of an antibody White et al. 2001 21 446 455 . In a preferred embodiment Fc regions in an Fc variant are linked genetically to generated tandemly linked Fc regions as described in U.S. Ser. No. 60 531 752 filed Dec. 22 2003 entitled Fc polypeptides with novel Fc receptor binding sites . Tandemly linked Fc polypeptides may comprise two or more Fc regions preferably one to three most preferably two Fc regions. It may be advantageous to explore a number of engineering constructs in order to obtain homo or hetero tandemly linked Fc variants with the most favorable structural and functional properties. Tandemly linked Fc variants may be homo tandemly linked Fc variants that is an Fc variant of one isotype is fused genetically to another Fc variant of the same isotype. It is anticipated that because there are multiple Fc R C1q and or FcRn binding sites on tandemly linked Fc polypeptides effector functions and or pharmacokinetics may be enhanced. In an alternate embodiment Fc variants from different isotypes may be tandemly linked referred to as hetero tandemly linked Fc variants. For example because of the capacity to target Fc R and Fc RI receptors an Fc variant that binds both Fc Rs and Fc RI may provide a significant clinical improvement.

As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art in reality the concepts and definitions of fusion and conjugate are overlapping. The designation of an Fc variant as a fusion or conjugate is not meant to constrain it to any particular embodiment of the present invention. Rather these terms are used loosely to convey the broad concept that any Fc variant of the present invention may be linked genetically chemically or otherwise to one or more polypeptides or molecules to provide some desirable property.

Fusion and conjugate partners may be linked to any region of an Fc variant of the present invention including at the N or C termini or at some residue in between the termini. In a preferred embodiment a fusion or conjugate partner is linked at the N or C terminus of the Fc variant most preferably the N terminus. A variety of linkers may find use in the present invention to covalently link Fc variants to a fusion or conjugate partner or generate an Fc fusion. By linker linker sequence spacer tethering sequence or grammatical equivalents thereof herein is meant a molecule or group of molecules such as a monomer or polymer that connects two molecules and often serves to place the two molecules in a preferred configuration. A number of strategies may be used to covalently link molecules together. These include but are not limited to polypeptide linkages between N and C termini of proteins or protein domains linkage via disulfide bonds and linkage via chemical cross linking reagents. In one aspect of this embodiment the linker is a peptide bond generated by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. Choosing a suitable linker for a specific case where two polypeptide chains are to be connected depends on various parameters including but not limited to the nature of the two polypeptide chains e.g. whether they naturally oligomerize the distance between the N and the C termini to be connected if known and or the stability of the linker towards proteolysis and oxidation. Furthermore the linker may contain amino acid residues that provide flexibility. Thus the linker peptide may predominantly include the following amino acid residues Gly Ser Ala or Thr. The linker peptide should have a length that is adequate to link two molecules in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity. Suitable lengths for this purpose include at least one and not more than 50 amino acid residues. Preferably the linker is from about 1 to 30 amino acids in length with linkers of 1 to 20 amino acids in length being most preferred. In addition the amino acid residues selected for inclusion in the linker peptide should exhibit properties that do not interfere significantly with the activity of the polypeptide. Thus the linker peptide on the whole should not exhibit a charge that would be inconsistent with the activity of the polypeptide or interfere with internal folding or form bonds or other interactions with amino acid residues in one or more of the monomers that would seriously impede the binding of receptor monomer domains. Useful linkers include glycine serine polymers including for example GS n GSGGS n SEQ ID NO 9 GGGGS n SEQ ID NO 10 and GGGS n SEQ ID NO 11 where n is an integer of at least one glycine alanine polymers alanine serine polymers and other flexible linkers such as the tether for the shaker potassium channel and a large variety of other flexible linkers as will be appreciated by those in the art. Glycine serine polymers are preferred since both of these amino acids are relatively unstructured and therefore may be able to serve as a neutral tether between components. Secondly serine is hydrophilic and therefore able to solubilize what could be a globular glycine chain. Third similar chains have been shown to be effective in joining subunits of recombinant proteins such as single chain antibodies. Suitable linkers may also be identified by screening databases of known three dimensional structures for naturally occurring motifs that can bridge the gap between two polypeptide chains. In a preferred embodiment the linker is not immunogenic when administered in a human patient. Thus linkers may be chosen such that they have low immunogenicity or are thought to have low immunogenicity. For example a linker may be chosen that exists naturally in a human. In a most preferred embodiment the linker has the sequence of the hinge region of an antibody that is the sequence that links the antibody Fab and Fc regions alternatively the linker has a sequence that comprises part of the hinge region or a sequence that is substantially similar to the hinge region of an antibody. Another way of obtaining a suitable linker is by optimizing a simple linker e.g. Gly4Ser n SEQ ID NO 10 through random mutagenesis. Alternatively once a suitable polypeptide linker is defined additional linker polypeptides can be created to select amino acids that more optimally interact with the domains being linked. Other types of linkers that may be used in the present invention include artificial polypeptide linkers and inteins. In another embodiment disulfide bonds are designed to link the two molecules. In another embodiment linkers are chemical cross linking agents. For example a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents may be used including but not limited to N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as tolyene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 1971 Science 238 1098. Chemical linkers may enable chelation of an isotope. For example Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody see PCT WO 94 11026 . The linker may be cleavable facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. 1992 Cancer Research 52 127 131 may be used. Alternatively a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers including but not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG polypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylenes or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol may find use as linkers that is may find use to link the Fc variants of the present invention to a fusion or conjugate partner to generate an Fc fusion or to link the Fc variants of the present invention to a conjugate.

Design strategies computational screening methods and library generation methods are described in U.S. Ser. No. 10 672 280 and U.S. Ser. No. 10 822 231 entitled Optimized Fc Variants and Methods for their Generation herein expressly incorporated by reference. These strategies approaches techniques and methods may be applied individually or in various combinations to generate optimized Fc variants.

The present invention provides methods for producing and experimentally testing Fc variants. The described methods are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation. Rather the provided methods are meant to illustrate generally that one or more Fc variants may be produced and experimentally tested to obtain variant Fc variants. General methods for antibody molecular biology expression purification and screening are described in Antibody Engineering edited by Duebel Kontermann Springer Verlag Heidelberg 2001 and Hayhurst Georgiou 2001 5 683 689 Maynard Georgiou 2000 2 339 76 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual by Harlow Lane New York Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1988.

In one embodiment of the present invention nucleic acids are created that encode the Fc variants and that may then be cloned into host cells expressed and assayed if desired. Thus nucleic acids and particularly DNA may be made that encode each protein sequence. These practices are carried out using well known procedures. For example a variety of methods that may find use in the present invention are described in Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 3Ed. Maniatis Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press New York 2001 and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons . As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the generation of exact sequences for a library comprising a large number of sequences is potentially expensive and time consuming. Accordingly there are a variety of techniques that may be used to efficiently generate libraries of the present invention. Such methods that may find use in the present invention are described or referenced in U.S. Pat. No. 6 403 312 U.S. Ser. No. 09 782 004 U.S. Ser. No. 09 927 790 U.S. Ser. No. 10 218 102 PCT WO 01 40091 and PCT WO 02 25588. Such methods include but are not limited to gene assembly methods PCR based method and methods which use variations of PCR ligase chain reaction based methods pooled oligo methods such as those used in synthetic shuffling error prone amplification methods and methods which use oligos with random mutations classical site directed mutagenesis methods cassette mutagenesis and other amplification and gene synthesis methods. As is known in the art there are a variety of commercially available kits and methods for gene assembly mutagenesis vector subcloning and the like and such commercial products find use in the present invention for generating nucleic acids that encode Fc variants.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be produced by culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid preferably an expression vector containing nucleic acid encoding the Fc variants under the appropriate conditions to induce or cause expression of the protein. The conditions appropriate for expression will vary with the choice of the expression vector and the host cell and will be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art through routine experimentation. A wide variety of appropriate host cells may be used including but not limited to mammalian cells bacteria insect cells and yeast. For example a variety of cell lines that may find use in the present invention are described in the ATCC cell line catalog available from the American Type Culture Collection.

In a preferred embodiment the Fc variants are expressed in mammalian expression systems including systems in which the expression constructs are introduced into the mammalian cells using virus such as retrovirus or adenovirus. Any mammalian cells may be used with human mouse rat hamster and primate cells being particularly preferred. Suitable cells also include known research cells including but not limited to Jurkat T cells NIH3T3 CHO BHK COS HEK293 PER C.6 HeLa Sp2 0 NSO cells and variants thereof. In an alternately preferred embodiment library proteins are expressed in bacterial cells. Bacterial expression systems are well known in the art and include and . In alternate embodiments Fc variants are produced in insect cells e.g. Sf21 Sf9 Bti Tn5b1 4 or yeast cells e.g. etc . In an alternate embodiment Fc variants are expressed in vitro using cell free translation systems. In vitro translation systems derived from both prokaryotic e.g. and eukaryotic e.g. wheat germ rabbit reticulocytes cells are available and may be chosen based on the expression levels and functional properties of the protein of interest. For example as appreciated by those skilled in the art in vitro translation is required for some display technologies for example ribosome display. In addition the Fc variants may be produced by chemical synthesis methods. Also transgenic expression systems both animal e.g. cow sheep or goat milk embryonated hen s eggs whole insect larvae etc. and plant e.g. corn tobacco duckweed etc. 

The nucleic acids that encode the Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into an expression vector in order to express the protein. A variety of expression vectors may be utilized for protein expression. Expression vectors may comprise self replicating extra chromosomal vectors or vectors which integrate into a host genome. Expression vectors are constructed to be compatible with the host cell type. Thus expression vectors which find use in the present invention include but are not limited to those which enable protein expression in mammalian cells bacteria insect cells yeast and in in vitro systems. As is known in the art a variety of expression vectors are available commercially or otherwise that may find use in the present invention for expressing Fc variants.

Expression vectors typically comprise a protein operably linked with control or regulatory sequences selectable markers any fusion partners and or additional elements. By operably linked herein is meant that the nucleic acid is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. Generally these expression vectors include transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the Fc variant and are typically appropriate to the host cell used to express the protein. In general the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences may include promoter sequences ribosomal binding sites transcriptional start and stop sequences translational start and stop sequences and enhancer or activator sequences. As is also known in the art expression vectors typically contain a selection gene or marker to allow the selection of transformed host cells containing the expression vector. Selection genes are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used.

Fc variants may be operably linked to a fusion partner to enable targeting of the expressed protein purification screening display and the like. Fusion partners may be linked to the Fc variant sequence via a linker sequences. The linker sequence will generally comprise a small number of amino acids typically less than ten although longer linkers may also be used. Typically linker sequences are selected to be flexible and resistant to degradation. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art any of a wide variety of sequences may be used as linkers. For example a common linker sequence comprises the amino acid sequence GGGGS SEQ ID NO. 10. A fusion partner may be a targeting or signal sequence that directs Fc variant and any associated fusion partners to a desired cellular location or to the extracellular media. As is known in the art certain signaling sequences may target a protein to be either secreted into the growth media or into the periplasmic space located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. A fusion partner may also be a sequence that encodes a peptide or protein that enables purification and or screening. Such fusion partners include but are not limited to polyhistidine tags His tags for example Hand Hor other tags for use with Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography IMAC systems e.g. Niaffinity columns GST fusions MBP fusions Strep tag the BSP biotinylation target sequence of the bacterial enzyme BirA and epitope tags which are targeted by antibodies for example c myc tags flag tags and the like . As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art such tags may be useful for purification for screening or both. For example an Fc variant may be purified using a His tag by immobilizing it to a Niaffinity column and then after purification the same His tag may be used to immobilize the antibody to a Nicoated plate to perform an ELISA or other binding assay as described below . A fusion partner may enable the use of a selection method to screen Fc variants see below . Fusion partners that enable a variety of selection methods are well known in the art and all of these find use in the present invention. For example by fusing the members of an Fc variant library to the gene III protein phage display can be employed Kay et al. Phage display of peptides and proteins a laboratory manual Academic Press San Diego Calif. 1996 Lowman et al. 1991 30 10832 10838 Smith 1985 228 1315 1317 . Fusion partners may enable Fc variants to be labeled. Alternatively a fusion partner may bind to a specific sequence on the expression vector enabling the fusion partner and associated Fc variant to be linked covalently or noncovalently with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example U.S. Ser. No. 09 642 574 U.S. Ser. No. 10 080 376 U.S. Ser. No. 09 792 630 U.S. Ser. No. 10 023 208 U.S. Ser. No. 09 792 626 U.S. Ser. No. 10 082 671 U.S. Ser. No. 09 953 351 U.S. Ser. No. 10 097 100 U.S. Ser. No. 60 366 658 PCT WO 00 22906 PCT WO 01 49058 PCT WO 02 04852 PCT WO 02 04853 PCT WO 02 08023 PCT WO 01 28702 and PCT WO 02 07466 describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention.

The methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into host cells are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used. Techniques include but are not limited to dextran mediated transfection calcium phosphate precipitation calcium chloride treatment polybrene mediated transfection protoplast fusion electroporation viral or phage infection encapsulation of the polynucleotide s in liposomes and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In the case of mammalian cells transfection may be either transient or stable.

In a preferred embodiment Fc variants are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques including ion exchange hydrophobic interaction affinity sizing or gel filtration and reversed phase carried out at atmospheric pressure or at high pressure using systems such as FPLC and HPLC. Purification methods also include electrophoretic immunological precipitation dialysis and chromatofocusing techniques. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques in conjunction with protein concentration are also useful. As is well known in the art a variety of natural proteins bind Fc and antibodies and these proteins can find use in the present invention for purification of Fc variants. For example the bacterial proteins A and G bind to the Fc region. Likewise the bacterial protein L binds to the Fab region of some antibodies as of course does the antibody s target antigen. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example Fc variants may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed Niaffinity chromatography if a His tag is employed or immobilized anti flag antibody if a flag tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques see Protein Purification Principles and Practice 3Ed. Scopes Springer Verlag NY 1994. The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the screen or use of the Fc variants. In some instances no purification is necessary. For example in one embodiment if the Fc variants are secreted screening may take place directly from the media. As is well known in the art some methods of selection do not involve purification of proteins. Thus for example if a library of Fc variants is made into a phage display library protein purification may not be performed.

Fc variants may be screened using a variety of methods including but not limited to those that use in vitro assays in vivo and cell based assays and selection technologies. Automation and high throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label. The use of fusion partners has been discussed above. By labeled herein is meant that the Fc variants of the invention have one or more elements isotopes or chemical compounds attached to enable the detection in a screen. In general labels fall into three classes a immune labels which may be an epitope incorporated as a fusion partner that is recognized by an antibody b isotopic labels which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes and c small molecule labels which may include fluorescent and calorimetric dyes or molecules such as biotin that enable other labeling methods. Labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position and may be incorporated in vitro or in vivo during protein expression.

In a preferred embodiment the functional and or biophysical properties of Fc variants are screened in an in vitro assay. In vitro assays may allow a broad dynamic range for screening properties of interest. Properties of Fc variants that may be screened include but are not limited to stability solubility and affinity for Fc ligands for example Fc Rs. Multiple properties may be screened simultaneously or individually. Proteins may be purified or unpurified depending on the requirements of the assay. In one embodiment the screen is a qualitative or quantitative binding assay for binding of Fc variants to a protein or nonprotein molecule that is known or thought to bind the Fc variant. In a preferred embodiment the screen is a binding assay for measuring binding to the Target antigen. In an alternately preferred embodiment the screen is an assay for binding of Fc variants to an Fc ligand including but are not limited to the family of Fc Rs the neonatal receptor FcRn the complement protein C1q and the bacterial proteins A and G. Said Fc ligands may be from any organism with humans mice rats rabbits and monkeys preferred. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art including but not limited to FRET Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer and BRET Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer based assays AlphaScreen Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay Scintillation Proximity Assay ELISA Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay SPR Surface Plasmon Resonance also known as BIACORE isothermal titration calorimetry differential scanning calorimetry gel electrophoresis and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label of the Fc variant. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic fluorescent luminescent or isotopic labels.

The biophysical properties of Fc variants for example stability and solubility may be screened using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example Fc variants of the present invention may be unfolded using chemical denaturant heat or pH and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy absorbance spectroscopy NMR spectroscopy calorimetry and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of an Fc variant may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use in the present invention for characterizing the biophysical properties of Fc variants include gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing capillary electrophoresis chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography ion exchange chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography peptide mapping oligosaccharide mapping mass spectrometry ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy circular dichroism spectroscopy isothermal titration calorimetry differential scanning calorimetry analytical ultra centrifugation dynamic light scattering proteolysis and cross linking turbidity measurement filter retardation assays immunological assays fluorescent dye binding assays protein staining assays microscopy and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use. In one embodiment stability and or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of protein solution after some defined period of time. In this assay the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition for example elevated temperature low pH or the presence of denaturant. Because function typically requires a stable soluble and or well folded structured protein the aforementioned functional and binding assays also provide ways to perform such a measurement. For example a solution comprising an Fc variant could be assayed for its ability to bind target antigen then exposed to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time then assayed for antigen binding again. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to be capable of binding antigen the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the Fc variant s stability and solubility.

In a preferred embodiment the library is screened using one or more cell based or in vitro assays. For such assays Fc variants purified or unpurified are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to individual variants or groups of variants belonging to a library. These assays are typically but not always based on the biology of the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to bind to the target antigen and mediate some biochemical event for example effector functions like cellular lysis phagocytosis ligand receptor binding inhibition inhibition of growth and or proliferation apoptosisand the like. Such assays often involve monitoring the response of cells to Fc variant for example cell survival cell death cellular phagocytosis cell lysis change in cellular morphology or transcriptional activation such as cellular expression of a natural gene or reporter gene. For example such assays may measure the ability of Fc variants to elicit ADCC ADCP or CDC. For some assays additional cells or components that is in addition to the target cells may need to be added for example example serum complement or effector cells such as peripheral blood monocytes PBMCs NK cells macrophages and the like. Such additional cells may be from any organism preferably humans mice rat rabbit and monkey. Crosslinked or monomeric antibodies and Fc fusions may cause apoptosis of certain cell lines expressing the antibody s target antigen or they may mediate attack on target cells by immune cells which have been added to the assay. Methods for monitoring cell death or viability are known in the art and include the use of dyes fluorophores immunochemical cytochemical and radioactive reagents. For example caspase assays or annexin flourconjugates may enable apoptosis to be measured and uptake or release of radioactive substrates e.g. Chromium 51 release assays or the metabolic reduction of fluorescent dyes such as alamar blue may enable cell growth proliferationor activation to be monitored. In a preferred embodiment the DELFIA EuTDA based cytotoxicity assay Perkin Elmer MA is used. Alternatively dead or damaged target cells may be monitored by measuring the release of one or more natural intracellular proteins for example lactate dehydrogenase. Transcriptional activation may also serve as a method for assaying function in cell based assays. In this case response may be monitored by assaying for natural genes or proteins which may be upregulated or down regulated for example the release of certain interleukins may be measured or alternatively readout may be via a luciferase or GFP reporter construct. Cell based assays may also involve the measure of morphological changes of cells as a response to the presence of an Fc variant. Cell types for such assays may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic and a variety of cell lines that are known in the art may be employed. Alternatively cell based screens are performed using cells that have been transformed or transfected with nucleic acids encoding the Fc variants.

In vitro assays include but are not limited to binding assays ADCC CDC cytotoxicity proliferation peroxide ozone release chemotaxis of effector cells inhibition of such assays by reduced effector function antibodies ranges of activities such as 100 improvement or 100 reduction blends of receptor activation and the assay outcomes that are expected from such receptor profiles.

The biological properties of the Fc variants of the present invention may be characterized in cell tissue and whole organism experiments. As is know in the art drugs are often tested in animals including but not limited to mice rats rabbits dogs cats pigs and monkeys in order to measure a drug s efficacy for treatment against a disease or disease model or to measure a drug s pharmacokinetics toxicity and other properties. Said animals may be referred to as disease models. With respect to the Fc variants of the present invention a particular challenge arises when using animal models to evaluate the potential for in human efficacy of candidate polypeptides this is due at least in part to the fact that Fc variants that have a specific effect on the affinity for a human Fc receptor may not have a similar affinity effect with the orthologous animal receptor. These problems can be further exacerbated by the inevitable ambiguities associated with correct assignment of true orthologues Mechetina et al. 2002 54 463 468 and the fact that some orthologues simply do not exist in the animal for example humans possess an Fc RIIa whereas mice do not . Therapeutics are often tested in mice including but not limited to nude mice SCID mice xenograft mice and transgenic mice including knockins and knockouts . For example an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention that is intended as an anti cancer therapeutic may be tested in a mouse cancer model for example a xenograft mouse. In this method a tumor or tumor cell line is grafted onto or injected into a mouse and subsequently the mouse is treated with the therapeutic to determine the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to reduce or inhibit cancer growth and metastasis. An alterantive approach is the use of a SCID murine model in which immune deficient mice are injected with human PBLs conferring a semi functional and human immune system with an appropriate array of human Fc Rs to the mice that have subsequently been injected with antibodies or Fc polypeptides that target injected human tumor cells. In such a model the Fc polypeptides that target the desired antigen such as her2 neu on SkOV3 ovarian cancer cells interact with human PBLs within the mice to engage tumoricidal effector functions. Such experimentation may provide meaningful data for determination of the potential of said Fc variant to be used as a therapeutic. Any organism preferably mammals may be used for testing. For example because of their genetic similarity to humans monkeys can be suitable therapeutic models and thus may be used to test the efficacy toxicity pharmacokinetics or other property of the Fc polypeptides of the present invention. Tests of the Fc variants of the present invention in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs and thus of course these experiments are contemplated. Thus the Fc variants of the present invention may be tested in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy toxicity pharmacokinetics and or other clinical properties.

The Fc variants of the present invention may confer superior performance on Fc polypeptides therapeutics in animal models or in humans. The receptor binding profiles of such Fc variants as described in this specification may for example be selected to increase the potency of cytotoxic drugs or to target specific effector functions or effector cells to improve the selectivity of the drug s action. Further receptor binding profiles can be selected that may reduce some or all effector functions thereby reducing the side effects or toxicity of such Fc polypeptide drugs. For example an Fc variant with reduced binding to Fc RIIIa Fc RI and Fc RIIa can be selected to eliminate most cell mediated effector function or an Fc variant with reduced binding to C1q may be selected to limit complement mediated effector functions. In some contexts such effector functions are known to have potential toxic effects therefore eliminating them may increase the safety of the Fc polypeptide drug and such improved safety may be characterized in animal models. In some contexts such effector functions are known to mediate the desirable therapeutic activity therefore enhancing them may increase the activity or potency of the Fc polypeptide drug and such improved activity or potency may be characterized in animal models.

Optimized Fc variants can be tested in a variety of orthotopic tumor models. These clinically relevant animal models are important in the study of pathophysiology and therapy of aggressive cancers like pancreatic prostate and breast cancer. Immune deprived mice including but not limited to athymic nude or SCID mice are frequently used in scoring of local and systemic tumor spread from the site of intraorgan e.g. pancreas prostate or mammary gland injection of human tumor cells or fragments of donor patients.

In preferred embodiments Fc variants of the present invention may be assessed for efficacy in clinically relevant animal models of various human diseases. In many cases relevant models include various transgenic animals for specific tumor antigens. Relevant transgenic models such as those that express human Fc receptors e.g. Fc RIIIa including the gamma chain Fc RI Fc RIIa Fc RIIb and others could be used to evaluate and test the efficacy of Fc polypeptides of the present invention. Evaluation of Fc variants by the introduction of human genes which directly or indirectly mediate effector function in mice or other rodents may enable physiological studies of efficacy in tumor toxicity or other diseases such as autoimmune disorders and RA. Human Fc receptors such as Fc RIIIa may possess polymorphisms such as that at position 158 V or F as described which would further enable the introduction of specific and combinations of human polymorphisms into rodents. The various studies involving polymorphism specific Fc Rs is not limited to this section however and encompasses all discussions and applications of Fc Rs in general as specficied in throughout this application. Fc variants of the present invention may confer superior activity on Fc polypeptides in such transgenic models. In particular variants with binding profiles optimized for human Fc RIIIa mediated activity may show superior activity in transgenic CD16 Fc RIII mice. Similar improvements in efficacy in mice transgenic for the other human Fc receptors e.g. Fc RIIa Fc RI etc. may be observed for Fc variants with binding profiles optimized for the respective receptors. Mice transgenic for multiple human receptors would show improved activity for Fc variants with binding profiles optimized for the corresponding multiple receptors for example as outlined in Table 1.

The introduction of target tumor antigens such as human CD20 into rodent B cells in the form of a transgenic animal model can be used to provide a more relevant evaluation of efficacy. As such the target antigen need not be limited to a fully human construct but could be a fusion protein containing the relevant human epitope of the target antigen. In a preferred embodiment the testing of Fc polypeptides may include transgenic model systems which include the combination of but not limited to both human target antigen and human Fc receptors e.g. CD16 and other related receptors mediating effector functions to evaluate efficacy and tumoricidal activity.

In a preferred embodiment Fc polypeptides of the present invention that target the Her2 antigen e.g. Fc variants of mu4D5 or its humanized analogues may be assessed for efficacy in a clinically relevant mouse model of breast cancer. Examples of relevant models include but are not limited to 1 the HER2 neu neu N transgenic mice which are derived from the parental FVB N mouse strain and are transgenic for the rat form of the proto oncogene HER2 neu neu and 2 transgenic mice that overexpress human HER2 under the murine mammary tumor virus promoter Finkle et al. 2004 Clin Cancer Res. 10 7 2499 511 . Fc polypeptides of the present invention that show superior efficacy in these models represent likely candidates for further development.

Because of the difficulties and ambiguities associated with using animal models to characterize the potential efficacy of candidate therapeutic antibodies in a human patient some variant polypeptides of the present invention may find utility as proxies for assessing potential in human efficacy. Such proxy molecules would preferably mimic in the animal system the Fc R and or complement biology of a corresponding candidate human Fc variant. This mimicry is most likely to be manifested by relative association affinities between specific Fc variants and animal vs. human receptors. For example if one were using a mouse model to assess the potential in human efficacy of an Fc variant that has enhanced affinity for human Fc RIIIa an appropriate proxy variant would have enhanced affinity for mouse Fc RIII 2 mouse CD16 2 . Alternatively if one were using a mouse model to assess the potential in human efficacy of an Fc variant that has reduced affinity for the human inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb an appropriate proxy variant would have reduced affinity for mouse Fc RII. It should also be noted that the proxy Fc variants could be created in the context of a human Fc variant an animal Fc variant or both.

In a preferred embodiment the testing of Fc variants may include study of efficacy in primates e.g. cynomolgus monkey model to facilitate the evaluation of depletion of specific target cells harboring target antigen. Additional primate models include but not limited to that of the rhesus monkey and Fc polypeptides in therapeutic studies of autoimmune transplantation and cancer.

Toxicity studies are performed to determine the Fc polypeptide related effects that cannot be evaluated in standard pharmacology profile or occur only after repeated administration of the agent. Most toxicity tests are performed in two species a rodent and a non rodent to ensure that any unexpected adverse effects are not overlooked before new therapeutic entities are introduced into humans. In general these models may measure a variety of toxicities including genotoxicity chronic toxicity immunogenicity reproductive developmental toxicity and carcinogenicity. Included within the aforementioned parameters are standard measurement of food consumption bodyweight antibody formation clinical chemistry and macro and microscopic examination of standard organs tissues e.g. cardiotoxicity . Additional parameters of measurement are injection site trauma and the measurement of neutralizing antibodies if any. Traditionally monoclonal antibody therapeutics naked or conjugated are evaluated for cross reactivity with normal tissues immunogenicity antibody production conjugate or linker toxicity and bystander toxicity of radiolabeled species. Nonetheless such studies may have to be individualized to address specific concerns and following the guidance set by ICH S6 Safety studies for biotechnological products also noted above . As such the general principles are that the products are sufficiently well characterized and for which impurities contaminants have been removed that the test material is comparable throughout development and GLP compliance.

The pharmacokinetics PK of the Fc variants of the invention can be studied in a variety of animal systems with the most relevant being non human primates such as the cynomolgus rhesus monkeys. Single or repeated i.v. s.c. administrations over a dose range of 6000 fold 0.05 300 mg kg can be evaluated for the half life days to weeks using plasma concentration and clearance as well as volume of distribution at a steady state and level of systemic absorbance can be measured. Examples of such parameters of measurement generally include maximum observed plasma concentration Cmax the time to reach Cmax Tmax the area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to infinity AUC 0 inf and apparent elimination half life T1 2 . Additional measured parameters could include compartmental analysis of concentration time data obtained following i.v. administration and bioavailability. Examples of pharmacological toxicological studies using cynomolgus have been established for Rituxan and Zevalin in which monoclonal antibodies to CD20 are cross reactive. Biodistribution dosimetry for radiolabled antibodies or Fc fusions and PK studies can also be done in rodent models. Such studies would evaluate tolerance at all doses administered toxicity to local tissues preferential localization to rodent xenograft animal models depletion of target cells e.g. CD20 positive cells .

The Fc variants of the present invention may confer superior pharmacokinetics on Fc polypeptide therapeutics in animal systems or in humans. For example increased binding to FcRn may increase the half life and exposure of the Fc polypeptide. Alternatively decreased binding to FcRn may decrease the half life and exposure of the Fc polypeptide in cases where reduced exposure is favorable such as when such drug has side effects.

It is known in the art that the array of Fc receptors is differentially expressed on various immune cell types as well as in different tissues. Differential tissue distribution of Fc receptors may ultimately have an impact on the pharmacodynamic PD and pharmacokinetic PK properties of Fc variants of the present invention. Because Fc variants of the presentation have varying affinities for the array of Fc receptors further screening of the polypeptides for PD and or PK properties may be extremely useful for defining the optimal balance of PD PK and therapeutic efficacy conferred by each candidate polypeptide.

Pharmacodynamic studies may include but are not limited to targeting specific tumor cells or blocking signaling mechanisms measuring depletion of target antigen expressing cells or signals etc. The Fc variants of the present invention may target particular effector cell populations and thereby direct Fc polypeptides to recruit certain activities to improve potency or to increase penetration into a particularly favorable physiological compartment. For example neutrophil activity and localization can be targeted by an Fc variant that preferentially targets Fc RIIIb. Such pharmacodynamic effects may be demonstrated in animal models or in humans.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be used for various therapeutic purposes. As will be appreciated by those in the art the Fc variants of the present invention may be used for any therapeutic purpose for which antibodies Fc fusions and the like may be used. In a preferred embodiment the Fc variants are administered to a patient to treat disorders including but not limited to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases infectious diseases and cancer.

A patient for the purposes of the present invention includes both humans and other animals preferably mammals and most preferably humans. Thus the Fc variants of the present invention have both human therapy and veterinary applications. The term treatment in the present invention is meant to include therapeutic treatment as well as prophylactic or suppressive measures for a disease or disorder. Thus for example successful administration of an Fc variant prior to onset of the disease results in treatment of the disease. As another example successful administration of an optimized Fc variant after clinical manifestation of the disease to combat the symptoms of the disease comprises treatment of the disease. Treatment also encompasses administration of an optimized Fc variant after the appearance of the disease in order to eradicate the disease. Successful administration of an agent after onset and after clinical symptoms have developed with possible abatement of clinical symptoms and perhaps amelioration of the disease comprises treatment of the disease. Those in need of treatment include mammals already having the disease or disorder as well as those prone to having the disease or disorder including those in which the disease or disorder is to be prevented.

In one embodiment an Fc variant of the present invention is administered to a patient having a disease involving inappropriate expression of a protein or other molecule. Within the scope of the present invention this is meant to include diseases and disorders characterized by aberrant proteins due for example to alterations in the amount of a protein present protein localization posttranslational modification conformational state the presence of a mutant or pathogen protein etc. Similarly the disease or disorder may be characterized by alterations molecules including but not limited to polysaccharides and gangliosides. An overabundance may be due to any cause including but not limited to overexpression at the molecular level prolonged or accumulated appearance at the site of action or increased activity of a protein relative to normal. Included within this definition are diseases and disorders characterized by a reduction of a protein. This reduction may be due to any cause including but not limited to reduced expression at the molecular level shortened or reduced appearance at the site of action mutant forms of a protein or decreased activity of a protein relative to normal. Such an overabundance or reduction of a protein can be measured relative to normal expression appearance or activity of a protein and said measurement may play an important role in the development and or clinical testing of the Fc variants of the present invention.

Pharmaceutical compositions are contemplated wherein an Fc variant of the present invention and one or more therapeutically active agents are formulated. Formulations of the Fc variants of the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing said Fc variant having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate acetate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl orbenzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol sweeteners and other flavoring agents fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose lactose corn and other starches binding agents additives coloring agents salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG . In a preferred embodiment the pharmaceutical composition that comprises the Fc variant of the present invention may be in a water soluble form such as being present as pharmaceutically acceptable salts which is meant to include both acid and base addition salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt refers to those salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid and the like and organic acids such as acetic acid propionic acid glycolic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid maleic acid malonic acid succinic acid fumaric acid tartaric acid citric acid benzoic acid cinnamic acid mandelic acid methanesulfonic acid ethanesulfonic acid p toluenesulfonic acid salicylic acid and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium potassium lithium ammonium calcium magnesium iron zinc copper manganese aluminum salts and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium potassium sodium calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non toxic bases include salts of primary secondary and tertiary amines substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins such as isopropylamine trimethylamine diethylamine triethylamine tripropylamine and ethanolamine. The formulations to be used for in vivo administration are preferrably sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes or other methods.

The Fc variants disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle comprising various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant that is useful for delivery of a therapeutic agent to a mammal. Liposomes containing the Fc variant are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 1985 82 3688 Hwang et al. 1980 77 4030 U.S. Pat. No. 4 485 045 U.S. Pat. No. 4 544 545 and PCT WO 97 38731. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. A chemotherapeutic agent or other therapeutically active agent is optionally contained within the liposome Gabizon et al. 1989 81 1484 .

The Fc variant and other therapeutically active agents may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared by methods including but not limited to coacervation techniques interfacial polymerization for example using hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules or poly methylmethacylate microcapsules colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules and macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980. Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymer which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and gamma ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT which are injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid and ProLease commercially available from Alkermes which is a microsphere based delivery system composed of the desired bioactive molecule incorporated into a matrix of poly DL lactide co glycolide PLG .

Administration of the pharmaceutical composition comprising an Fc variant of the present invention preferably in the form of a sterile aqueous solution may be done in a variety of ways including but not limited to orally subcutaneously intravenously intranasally intraotically transdermally topically e.g. gels salves lotions creams etc. intraperitoneally intramuscularly intrapulmonary vaginally parenterally rectally or intraocularly. In some instances for example for the treatment of wounds inflammation etc. the Fc variant may be directly applied as a solution or spray. As is known in the art the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated accordingly depending upon the manner of introduction.

Subcutaneous administration may be preferable in some circumstances because the patient may self administer the pharmaceutical composition. Many protein therapeutics are not sufficiently potent to allow for formulation of a therapeutically effective dose in the maximum acceptable volume for subcutaneous administration. This problem may be addressed in part by the use of protein formulations comprising arginine HCl histidine and polysorbate see WO 04091658 . Fc polypeptides of the present invention may be more amenable to subcutaneous administration due to for example increased potency improved serum half life or enhanced solubility.

As is known in the art protein therapeutics are often delivered by IV infusion or bolus. The Fc variants of the present invention may also be delivered using such methods. For example administration may venous be by intravenous infusion with 0.9 sodium chloride as an infusion vehicle.

Pulmonary delivery may be accomplished using an inhaler or nebulizer and a formulation comprising an aerosolizing agent. For example AERx inhalable technology commercially available from Aradigm or Inhance pulmonary delivery system commercially available from Nektar Therapeutics may be used. Fc variants of the present invention may be more amenable to intrapulmonary delivery. FcRn is present in the lung and may promote transport from the lung to the bloodstream e.g. Syntonix WO 04004798 Bitonti et al. 2004 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 101 9763 8 . Accordingly antibodies or Fc fusions that bind FcRn more effectively in the lung or that are released more efficiently in the bloodstream may have improved bioavailability following intrapulmonary administration. Fc variants of the present invention may also be more amenable to intrapulmonary administration due to for example improved solubility or altered isoelectric point.

Furthermore Fc polypeptides of the present invention may be more amenable to oral delivery due to for example improved stability at gastric pH and increased resistance to proteolysis. Furthermore FcRn appears to be expressed in the intestinal epithelia of adults Dickinson et al. 1999 J Clin Invest 104 903 11 so Fc polypeptides of the present invention for example antibodies or Fc fusions with improved FcRn interaction profiles may show enhanced bioavailability following oral administration. FcRn mediated transport of Fc variants may also occur at other mucus membranes such as those in the gastrointestinal respiratory and genital tracts Yoshida et al. 2004 Immunity 20 769 83 .

In addition any of a number of delivery systems are known in the art and may be used to administer the Fc variants of the present invention. Examples include but are not limited to encapsulation in liposomes microparticles microspheres eg. PLA PGA microspheres and the like. Alternatively an implant of a porous non porous or gelatinous material including membranes or fibers may be used. Sustained release systems may comprise a polymeric material or matrix such as polyesters hydrogels poly vinylalcohol polylactides copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L gutamate ethylene vinyl acetate lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT and poly D 3 hydroxyburyric acid. It is also possible to administer a nucleic acid encoding the Fc variant of the current invention for example by retroviral infection direct injection or coating with lipids cell surface receptors or other transfection agents. In all cases controlled release systems may be used to release the Fc variant at or close to the desired location of action.

The dosing amounts and frequencies of administration are in a preferred embodiment selected to be therapeutically or prophylactically effective. As is known in the art adjustments for protein degradation systemic versus localized delivery and rate of new protease synthesis as well as the age body weight general health sex diet time of administration drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation by those skilled in the art.

The concentration of the therapeutically active Fc variant in the formulation may vary from about 0.1 to 100 weight . In a preferred embodiment the concentration of the Fc variant is in the range of 0.003 to 1.0 molar. In order to treat a patient a therapeutically effective dose of the Fc variant of the present invention may be administered. By therapeutically effective dose herein is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. Dosages may range from 0.0001 to 100 mg kg of body weight or greater for example 0.1 1 10 or 50 mg kg of body weight with 1 to 10 mg kg being preferred.

In some embodiments only a single dose of the Fc variant is used. In other embodiments multiple doses of the Fc variant are administered. The elapsed time between administrations may be less than 1 hour about 1 hour about 1 2 hours about 2 3 hours about 3 4 hours about 6 hours about 12 hours about 24 hours about 48 hours about 2 4 days about 4 6 days about 1 week about 2 weeks or more than 2 weeks.

In other embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention are administered in metronomic dosing regimes either by continuous infusion or frequent administration without extended rest periods. Such metronomic administration may involve dosing at constant intervals without rest periods. Typically such regimens encompass chronic low dose or continuous infusion for an extended period of time for example 1 2 days 1 2 weeks 1 2 months or up to 6 months or more. The use of lower doses may minimize side effects and the need for rest periods.

In certain embodiments the Fc variant of the present invention and one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents are cyclically administered to the patient. Cycling therapy involves administration of a first agent at one time a second agent at a second time optionally additional agents at additional times optionally a rest period and then repeating this sequence of administration one or more times. The number of cycles is typically from 2 10. Cycling therapy may reduce the development of resistance to one or more agents may minimize side effects or may improve treatment efficacy.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be administered concomitantly with one or more other therapeutic regimens or agents. The additional therapeutic regimes or agents may be used to improve the efficacy or safety of the Fc variant. Also the additional therapeutic regimes or agents may be used to treat the same disease or a comorbidity rather than to alter the action of the Fc variant. For example an Fc variant of the present invention may be administered to the patient along with chemotherapy radiation therapy or both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The Fc variant of the present invention may be administered in combination with one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents including but not limited to cytotoxic agents chemotherapeutic agents cytokines growth inhibitory agents anti hormonal agents kinase inhibitors anti angiogenic agents cardioprotectants immunostimulatory agents immunosuppressive agents agents that promote proliferation of hematological cells angiogenesis inhibitors protein tyrosine kinase PTK inhibitors additional Fc variants Fc RIIb or other Fc receptor inhibitors or other therapeutic agents.

The terms in combination with and co administration are not limited to the administration of said prophylactic or therapeutic agents at exactly the same time. Instead it is meant that the Fc variant of the present invention and the other agent or agents are administered in a sequence and within a time interval such that they may act together to provide a benefit that is increased versus treatment with only either the Fc variant of the present invention or the other agent or agents. It is preferred that the Fc variant and the other agent or agents act additively and especially preferred that they act synergistically. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. The skilled medical practitioner can determine empirically or by considering the pharmacokinetics and modes of action of the agents the appropriate dose or doses of each therapeutic agent as well as the appropriate timings and methods of administration.

In one embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are administered with one or more additional molecules comprising antibodies or Fc. The Fc variants of the present invention may be co administered with one or more other antibodies that have efficacy in treating the same disease or an additional comorbidity for example two antibodies may be administered that recognize two antigens that are overexpressed in a given type of cancer or two antigens that mediate pathogenesis of an autoimmune or infectious disease.

The immediate release and controlled release formulations could be administered separately or be combined into one unit dosage form. Administration of an Fc RIIb inhibitor may also be used to limit unwanted immune responses for example anti Factor VIII antibody response following Factor VIII administration to hemophiliacs.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other therapeutic regimens. For example in one embodiment the patient to be treated with an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may also receive radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can be administered according to protocols commonly employed in the art and known to the skilled artisan. Such therapy includes but is not limited to cesium iridium iodine or cobalt radiation. The radiation therapy may be whole body irradiation or may be directed locally to a specific site or tissue in or on the body such as the lung bladder or prostate. Typically radiation therapy is administered in pulses over a period of time from about 1 to 2 weeks. The radiation therapy may however be administered over longer periods of time. For instance radiation therapy may be administered to patients having head and neck cancer for about 6 to about 7 weeks. Optionally the radiation therapy may be administered as a single dose or as multiple sequential doses. The skilled medical practitioner can determine empirically the appropriate dose or doses of radiation therapy useful herein. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention the Fc variant of the present invention and one or more other anti cancer therapies are employed to treat cancer cells ex vivo. It is contemplated that such ex vivo treatment may be useful in bone marrow transplantation and particularly autologous bone marrow transplantation. For instance treatment of cells or tissue s containing cancer cells with Fc variant and one or more other anti cancer therapies such as described above can be employed to deplete or substantially deplete the cancer cells prior to transplantation in a recipient patient.

Radiation therapy may also comprise treatment with an isotopically labeled molecule such as an antibody. Examples of radioimmunotherapeutics include but Zevalin Y 90 labeled anti CD20 LymphoCide Y 90 labeled anti CD22 and Bexxar 1 131 labeled anti CD20 

It is of course contemplated that the Fc variants of the invention may employ in combination with still other therapeutic techniques such as surgery or phototherapy.

Pharmacogenomic approaches to clinical trials abd therapy are embodiments of the present invention. A number of the receptors that may interact with the Fc variants of the present invention are polymorphic in the human population. For a given patient or population of patients the efficacy of the Fc variants of the present invention may be affected by the presence or absence of specific polymorphisms in proteins. For example Fc RIIIs is polymorphic at position 158 which is commonly either V high affinity or F low affinity . Patients with the VN homozygous genotype are observed to have a better clinical response to treatment with the anti CD20 antibody Rituxan rituximab Carton et al. 2002 Blood 99 754 758 Weng et al. 2003 J Clin Oncol 21 3940 3947 Dall Ozzo et al. 2004 Cancer Res 64 4664 9 . Additional polymorphisms include but are not limited to Fc RIIa R131 or H131 and such polymorphisms are known to either increase or decrease Fc binding and subsequent biological activity depending on the polymorphism. Fc variants of the present invention may bind preferentially to a particular polymorphic form of a receptor for example F158 Fc RIIIa or to bind with equivalent affinity to all of the polymorphisms at a particular position in the receptor for example both the V158 and F158 polymorphisms of Fc RIIIa. In a preferred embodiment Fc variants of the present invention that provide equivalent binding to polymorphisms may be used in an antibody to eliminate the differential efficacy seen in patients with different polymorphisms. Such a property may give greater consistency in therapeutic response and reduce non responding patient populations. Such variant Fc with indentical binding to receptor polymorphisms may have increased biological activity such as ADCC CDC or circulating half life or alternatively decreased activity via modulation of the binding to the relevant Fc receptors. In a preferred embodiment Fc variants of the present invention may bind with higher or lower affinity to one of the polymorphisms of a receptor either accentuating the existing difference in binding or reversing the difference. Such a property may allow creation of therapeutics particularly tailored for efficacy with a patient population possessing such polymorphism. For example a patient population possessing an Fc RIIb polymorphism that binds with higher affinity to Fc could receive a drug containing an Fc variant with reduced binding to such polymorphic form of the receptor creating a more efficacious drug.

In a preferred embodiment patients are screened for one or more polymorphisms in order to predict the efficacy of the Fc variants of the present invention. This information may be used for example to select patients to include or exclude from clinical trials or post approval to provide guidance to physicians and patients regarding appropriate dosages and treatment options. For example the anti CD20 antibody rituximab is minimally effective in patients that are homozygous or heterozygous for F158 Fc RIIIa Carton et al. 2002 Blood 99 754 758 Weng et al. 2003 J Clin Oncol 21 3940 3947 Dall Ozzo et al. 2004 Cancer Res 64 4664 9 . Such patients may show an improved clinical response to antibodies comprising an Fc variant of the present invention. In one embodiment patients are selected for inclusion in clinical trials if their genotype indicates that they are likely to respond significantly better to an antibody of the present invention as compared to one or more currently used antibody therapeutics. In another embodiment appropriate dosages and treatment regimens are determined using such genotype information. In another embodiment patients are selected for inclusion in a clinical trial or for receipt of therapy post approval based on their polymorphism genotype where such therapy contains an Fc variant engineered to be specifically efficacious for such population or alternatively where such therapy contains an Fc variant that does not show differential activity to the different forms of the polymorphism.

Included in the present invention are diagnostic tests to identify patients who are likely to show a favorable clinical response to an Fc variant of the present invention or who are likely to exhibit a significantly better response when treated with an Fc variant of the present invention versus one or more currently used antibody therapeutics. Any of a number of methods for determining Fc R polymorphisms in humans known in the art may be used.

In a preferred embodiment patients are screened to predict the efficacy of the Fc polypeptides of the present invention. This information may be used for example to select patients to include or exclude from clinical trials or post approval to provide guidance to physicians and patients regarding appropriate dosages and treatment options. Screening may involve the determination of the expression level or distribution of the target antigen. For example the level of Her2 neu expression is currently used to select which patients will most favorably respond to trastuzumab therapy. Screening may also involve determination of genetic polymorphisms for example polymorphisms related to Fc Rs or Fc Rs. For example patients who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F158 polymorphic form of Fc RIIIa may respond clinically more favorably to the Fc polypeptides of the present invention. Information obtained from patient screening may be used to select patients for inclusion in clinical trials to determine appropriate dosages and treatment regimens or for other clinical applications. Included in the present invention are diagnostic tests to identify patients who are likely to show a favorable clinical response to an Fc polypeptide of the present invention or who are likely to exhibit a significantly better response when treated with an Fc polypeptide of the present invention versus one or more currently used biotherapeutics. Any of a number of methods for determining antigen expression levels antigen distribution and or genetic polymorphisms in humans known in the art may be used.

Furthermore the present invention comprises prognostic tests performed on clinical samples such as blood and tissue samples. Such tests may assay for effector function activity including but not limited to opsonization ADCC CDC ADCP or for killing regardless of mechanism of cancerous or otherwise pathogenic cells. In a preferred embodiment ADCC assays such as those described herein are used to predict for a specific patient the efficacy of a given Fc polypeptide of the present invention. Such information may be used to identify patients for inclusion or exclusion in clinical trials or to inform decisions regarding appropriate dosages and treatment regemins. Such information may also be used to select a drug that contains a particular Fc variant that shows superior activity in such an assay.

Examples are provided below to illustrate the present invention. These examples are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation.

For all positions discussed in the present invention numbering is according to the EU index or EU numbering scheme Kabat et al. 1991 5th Ed. United States Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda which refers to the numbering of the EU antibody Edelman et al. 1969 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 63 78 85 . Those skilled in the art of antibodies will appreciate that these conventions consist of nonsequential numbering in specific regions of an immunoglobulin sequence enabling a normalized reference to conserved positions in immunoglobulin families. Accordingly the positions of any given immunoglobulin as defined by EU index will not necessarily correspond to its sequential sequence. shows the sequential and EU index numbering schemes for the antibody alemtuzumab in order to illustrate this principal more clearly. It should also be noted that polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions including but not limited to Kabat 270 272 312 315 356 and 358 and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the scientific literature may exist.

Fc variants and Fc variant libraries were designed using computational and sequence based methods as described in U.S. Ser. No. 10 672 280 and U.S. Ser. No. 10 822 231. Experimental libraries were designed in successive rounds of computational and experimental screening. Design of subsequent Fc libraries benefitted from feedback from prior libraries and thus typically comprised combinations of Fc variants that showed favorable properties in the previous screen. shows residues at which amino acid modifications were made in the Fc variants of the present invention mapped onto the human Fc Fc RIIIb structure. The entire set of Fc variants that were constructed and experimentally tested is shown in .

The majority of experimentation on the Fc variants was carried out in the context of the anti cancer antibody alemtuzumab Campath a registered trademark of Ilex Pharmaceuticals LP . Alemtuzumab binds a short linear epitope within its target antigen CD52 Hale et al. 1990 35 118 127 Hale 1995 1 175 187 . Alemtuzumab has been chosen as the primary engineering template because its efficacy is due in part to its ability to recruit effector cells Dyer et al. 1989 73 1431 1439 Friend et al. 1991 23 2253 2254 Hale et al. 1998 92 4581 4590 Glennie et al. 2000 21 403 410 and because production and use of its antigen in binding assays are relatively straightforward. In order to evaluate the optimized Fc variants of the present invention in the context of other antibodies select Fc variants were evaluated in the anti Her2 antibody trastuzumab Herceptin a registered trademark of Genentech the anti CD20 antibody rituximab Rituxan a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation the anti EGFR antibody cetuximab Erbitux a registered trademark of Imclone and the anti CD20 antibody PRO70769 PCT US2003 040426 entitled Immunoglobulin Variants and Uses Thereof . The use of alemtuzumab trastuzumab rituximab cetuximab and PRO70769 for screening purposes is not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular antibody.

The IgG1 full length light V C and heavy V C 1 C 2 C 3 chain antibody genes for alemtuzumab campath 1 H James et al. 1999 289 293 301 trastuzumab hu4D5 8 Carter et al. 1992 89 4285 4289 Gerstner et al. 2002 321 851 862 rituximab C2B8 U.S. Pat. No. 6 399 061 and cetuximab C225 PCT US96 09847 were constructed using recursive PCR with convenient end restriction sites to facilitate subcloning. The genes were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. 1Zeo Invitrogen comprising the full length light kappa C and heavy chain IgG1 constant regions. The V C 1 C 2 C 3 clone in pcDNA3.1zeo was used as a template for mutagenesis of the Fc region. Mutations were introduced into this clone using PCR based mutagenesis or quick change mutagenesis Stratagene techniques. Fc variants were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the sequence. Plasmids containing heavy chain gene V C 1 C 2 C 3 wild type or variants were co transfected with plasmid containing light chain gene V C into 293T cells. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection. Expression of immunoglobulin was monitored by screening the culture supernatant of transfectomas by western using peroxidase conjugated goat anti human IgG Jackson ImmunoResearch catalog 109 035 088 . shows expression of wild type alemtuzumab and variants 1 through 10 in 293T cells. Antibodies were purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography Pierce Catalog 20334. shows results of the protein purification for WT alemtuzumab. Antibody Fc variants showed similar expression and purification results to WT. Some Fc variants were deglycosylated in order to determine their solution and functional properties in the absence of carbohydrate. To obtain deglycosylated antibodies purified alemtuzumab antibodies were incubated with peptide N glycosidase PNGase F at 37 C. for 24 h. presents an SDS PAGE gel confirming deglycosylation for several Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab.

In order to confirm the functional fidelity of alemtuzumab produced under these conditions the antigenic CD52 peptide fused to GST was expressed in BL21 DE3 under IPTG induction. Both un induced and induced samples were run on a SDS PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membrane. For western analysis either alemtuzumab from Sotec final concentration 2.5 ng ul or media of transfected 293T cells final alemtuzumab concentration about 0.1 0.2 ng ul were used as primary antibody and peroxidase conjugated goat anti human IgG was used as secondary antibody. presents these results. The ability to bind target antigen confirms the structural and functional fidelity of the expressed alemtuzumab. Fc variants that have the same variable region as WT alemtuzumab are anticipated to maintain a comparable binding affinity for antigen.

The gene encoding the extracellular region of human V158 Fc RIIIa was obtained by PCR from a clone obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection MGC 22630 . F158 Fc RIIIa was constructed by mutagenesis of the V158 Fc RIIIa gene. The genes encoding the extracellular regions of human Fc RI human Fc RIIa human Fc RIIb human Fc RIIc mouse Fc RIII and human FcRn chain and microglobulin chain were constructed using recursive PCR. Fc Rs and FcRn chain were fused at the C terminus with a 6 His tag and a GST tag. All genes were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1zeo vector. For expression vectors containing human Fc Rs were transfected into 293T cells FcRn chain and microglobulin chain were co transfected into 293T cells and mouse Fc RIII was transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Media containing secreted receptors were harvested 3 days later and purified using Nickel affinity chromatography. For western analysis membrane was probed with an anti GST antibody. presents an SDS PAGE gel that shows the results of expression and purification of human V158 Fc RIIIa. Purified human C1q protein complex was purchased commercially Quidel Corp. San Diego .

Binding to the human Fc ligands Fc RI Fc RIIa Fc RIIb Fc RIIc Fc RIIIa C1q and FcRn was measured for the designed Fc variants. Binding affinities were measured using an AlphaScreen assay Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay ALPHA PerkinElmer Wellesley Mass. a bead based luminescent proximity assay. Laser excitation of a donor bead excites oxygen which if sufficiently close to the acceptor bead generates a cascade of chemiluminescent events ultimately leading to fluorescence emission at 520 620 nm. WT alemtuzumab antibody was biotinylated by standard methods for attachment to streptavidin donor beads and GST tagged Fc Rs and FcRn were bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads. For the C1q binding assay untagged C1q protein was conjugated with Digoxygenin DIG Roche using N hydrosuccinimide NHS chemistry and bound to DIG acceptor beads. For the protein A binding assay protein A acceptor beads were purchased directly from PerkinElmer. The AlphaScreen assay was applied as a competition assay for screening Fc variants. In the absence of competing Fc variants WT antibody and Fc R interact and produce a signal at 520 620 nm. Addition of untagged Fc variant competes with the WT Fc Fc R interaction reducing fluorescence quantitatively to enable determination of relative binding affinities. Fc variants were screened in the context of either alemtuzumab or trastuzumab and select Fc variants were also screened in the context of rituximab and cetuximab.

Fc variants were also screened in parrallel for other Fc ligands. As discussed the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb plays an important role in effector function. Exemplary data for binding of select Fc variants of the invention to human Fc RIIb as measured by the AlphaScreen are provided in . Fc RIIa is an activating receptor that is highly homologous to Fc RIIb. Exemplary data for binding of select Fc variants to the R131 polymorphic form of human Fc RIIa are provided in . Another important Fc ligand is the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn. As discussed this receptor binds to the Fc region between the C 2 and C 3 domains because binding mediates endosomal recycling affinity of Fc for FcRn is a key determinant of antibody and Fc fusion pharmacokinetics. Exemplary data showing binding of select Fc variants to FcRn as measured by the AlphaScreen are provided in . The binding site for FcRn on Fc between the C 2 and C 3 domains is overlapping with the binding site for bacterial proteins A and G. Because protein A is frequently employed for antibody purification select variants were tested for binding to this Fc ligand. provides these AlphaScreen data. Although protein A was not included in the parrallel screen for all variants the ability of the Fc variants to be purified using protein A chromatography see Example 1 implies that for the majority of Fc variants the capacity to bind protein A and moreover the integrity of the C 2 C 3 hinge region are unaffected by the Fc substitutions.

The data for binding of Fc variants to Fc RI Fc RIIa Fc RIIb Fc RIIc Fc RIIIa C1q and FcRn were analyzed as described above for . The fold enhancement or reduction relative to WT for binding of each variant to each Fc ligand as measured by the AlphaScreen are provided in . The table presents for each variant the variant number Variant the substitution s of the variant the antibody context Context the fold affinity relative to WT Fold and the confidence Conf in the fold affinity for binding to each Fc ligand and the IIIa IIb specificity ratio IIIa IIb see below . Multiple data sets were acquired for many of the variants and all data for a given variant are grouped together. The context of the antibody indicates which antibodies have been constructed with the particular Fc variant a alemtuzumab t trastuzumab r rituximab c cetuximab and p PRO70769. The data provided were acquired in the context of the first antibody listed typically alemtuzumab although in some cases trastuzumab. An asterix indicates that the data for the given Fc ligand was acquired in the context of trastuzumab. A fold Fold above 1 indicates an enhancement in binding affinity and a fold below 1 indicates a reduction in binding affinity relative to the parent antibody for the given Fc ligand. Confidence values Conf correspond to the log confidence levels provided from the fits of the data to a sigmoidal dose response curve. As is known in the art a lower Conf value indicates lower error and greater confidence in the Fold value. The lack of data for a given variant and Fc ligand indicates either that the fits to the data did not provide a meaningful value or that the variant was not tested for that Fc ligand.

As discussed optimal effector function may result from Fc variants wherein affinity for activating Fc Rs is greater than affinity for the inhibitory Fc RIIb. Indeed a number of Fc variants have been obtained that show differentially enhanced binding to Fc RIIIa over Fc RIIb. AlphaScreen data directly comparing binding to Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIb for two Fc variants with this specificity profile A330L and A330Y are shown in and . This concept can be defined quantitatively as the fold enhancement or reduction of the activating Fc RIIa column 12 divided by the fold enhancement or reduction of the inhibitory Fc RIIb column 8 herein referred to as the Fc RIIIa fold Fc RIIb fold ratio or IIIa IIb ratio . This value is provided in column 18 of as IIIa IIb . Combination of A330L and A330Y with other variants for example A330L I332E A330Y I332 and S239D A330L I332E provide very favorable IIIa IIb ratios. shows that a number of Fc variants provide a positive favorable Fc RIIIa to Fc RIIb specificity profile with a IIIa IIb ratio as high as 86 1.

Some of the most promising Fc variants of the present invention for enhancing effector function have both substantial increases in affinity for Fc RIIIa and favorable Fc RIIIa fold Fc RIIb fold ratios. These include for example S239D I332E Fc RIIIa fold 56 192 Fc RIIIa fold Fc RIIb fold 3 S239D A330Y I332E Fc RIIIa fold 130 S239D A330L I332E Fc RIIIa fold 139 Fc RIIIa fold Fc RIIb fold 18 and S239D S298A I332E Fc RIIIa fold 295 Fc RIIIa fold Fc RIIb fold 48 . show AlphaScreen data monitoring binding of these and other Fc variants in the context of trastuzumab to human V158 Fc RIIIa and human Fc RIIb.

In addition to alemtuzumab and trastuzumab select Fc variants were screened in the context of other antibodies in order to investigate the breadth of their applicability. AlphaScreen data measuring binding of select Fc variants to human V158 Fc RIIIa in the context of rituximab and cetuximab are shown in and respectively. Together with the data shown previously for alemtuzumab and trastuzumab the results indicate consistent binding enhancements regardless of the antibody context and thus that the Fc variants of the present invention are broadly applicable to antibodies and Fc fusions.

As discussed above an important parameter of Fc mediated effector function is the affinity of Fc for both V158 and F158 polymorphic forms of Fc RIIIa. AlphaScreen data comparing binding of select variants to the two receptor allotypes are shown in V158 Fc RIIIa and F158 Fc RIIIa . As can be seen all variants improve binding to both Fc RIIIa allotypes. These data indicate that those Fc variants of the present invention with enhanced effector function will be broadly applicable to the entire patient population and that enhancement to clinical efficacy will potentially be greatest for the low responsive patient population who need it most.

The Fc R binding affinities of these Fc variants were further investigated using Surface Plasmon Resonance SPR Biacore Uppsala Sweden . SPR is a sensitive and extremely quantitative method that allows for the measurement of binding affinities of protein protein interactions and has been used to effectively measure Fc Fc R binding Radaev et al. 2001 276 16478 16483 . SPR thus provides an excellent complementary binding assay to the AlphaScreen assay. His tagged V158 Fc RIIIa was immobilized to an SPR chip and WT and Fc variant alemtuzumab antibodies were flowed over the chip at a range of concentrations. Binding constants were obtained from fitting the data using standard curve fitting methods. Table 3 presents dissociation constants Kd for binding of select Fc variants to V158 Fc RIIIa and F158 Fc RIIIa obtained using SPR and compares these with IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen assay. By dividing the Kd and IC50 for each variant by that of WT alemtuzumab the fold improvements over WT Fold WT are obtained.

The SPR data corroborate the improvements to Fc RIIIa affinity observed by AlphaScreen assay. Table 3 further indicates the superiority of V264I I332E and I332E over S298A and S298A E333A K334A whereas S298A E333A K334A improves Fc binding to V158 and F158 Fc RIIIa by 1.7 fold and 4.7 fold respectively I332E shows binding enhancements of 2.2 fold and 10.1 fold respectively and V264I I332E shows binding enhancements of 4.0 fold and 14 fold respectively. Also worth noting is that the affinity of V264I I332E for F158 Fc RIIIa 52 nM is better than that of WT for the V158 allotype 68 nM suggesting that this Fc variant as well as those with even greater improvements in binding may enable the clinical efficacy of antibodies for the low responsive patient population to achieve that currently possible for high responders. The correlation between the SPR and AlphaScreen binding measurements are shown in . and show the Kd IC50 correlations for binding to V158 Fc RIIIa and F158 Fc RIIIa respectively and and show the fold improvement correlations for binding to V158 Fc RIIIa and F158 Fc RIIIa respectively. The good fits of these data to straight lines r 0.9 r 0.84 r 0.98 and r 0.90 support the accuracy the AlphaScreen measurements and validate its use for determining the relative Fc R binding affinities of Fc variants.

SPR data were also acquired for binding of select trastuzumab Fc variants to human V158 Fc RIIIa F158 Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIb. These data are shown in Table 4. The Fc variants tested show substantial binding enhancements to the activating receptor Fc RIIIa with over 100 fold tighter binding observed for interaction of S239D I332E S298A with F158 Fc RIIIa. Furthermore for the best Fc RIIIa binders F158 Fc RIIIa Fc RIIb ratios of 3 4 are observed.

As discussed although there is a need for greater effector function for some antibody therapeutics reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. Several Fc variants in substantially reduce or ablate Fc R binding and thus may find use in antibodies and Fc fusions wherein effector function is undesirable. AlphaScreen data measuring binding of some exemplary Fc variants to human V158 Fc RIIIa are shown in and . These Fc variants as well as their use in combination may find use for eliminating effector function when desired for example in antibodies and Fc fusions whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen. Based on the data provided in preferred positions for reducing Fc ligand binding and or effector function that is positions that may be modified to reduce binding to one or more Fc ligands and or reduce effector function include but are not limited to positions 232 234 235 236 237 239 264 265 267 269 270 299 325 328 329 and 330.

In order to determine the effect on effector function cell based ADCC assays were performed on select Fc variants. ADCC was measured using the DELFIA EuTDA based cytotoxicity assay Perkin Elmer Mass. with purified human peripheral blood monocytes PBMCs as effector cells. Target cells were loaded with BATDA at 1 10cells ml washed 4 times and seeded into 96 well plate at 10 000 cells well. The target cells were then opsonized using Fc variant or WT antibodies at the indicated final concentration. Human PBMCs isolated from buffy coat were added at the indicated fold excess of target cells and the plate was incubated at 37 C. for 4 hrs. The co cultured cells were centrifuged at 500 g supernatants were transferred to a separate plate and incubated with Eu solution and relative fluorescence units were measured using a Packard Fusion FP HT reader Packard Biosciences IL . Samples were run in triplicate to provide error estimates n 3 S.D. . PBMCs were allotyped for the V158 or F158 Fc RIIIa allotype using PCR.

ADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab using DoHH 2 lymphoma target cells. is a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 10 ng ml antibody. Results show that alemtuzumab Fc variants I332E V264I and I332E V264I have substantially enhanced ADCC compared to WT alemtuzumab with the relative ADCC enhancements proportional to their binding improvements to Fc RIIIa as indicated by AlphaScreen assay and SPR. The dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration is shown in . The binding data were normalized to the minimum and maximum fluorescence signal for each particular curve provided by the baselines at low and high antibody concentrations respectively. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose response model using nonlinear regression represented by the curve in the figure. The fits enable determination of the effective concentration 50 EC50 i.e. the concentration required for 50 effectiveness which provides the relative enhancements to ADCC for each Fc variant. The EC50s for these binding data are analogous to the IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen competition data and derivation of these values is thus analogous to that described in Example 2 and . In the log EC50 s obtained from the fits to the data for WT V264I I332E and S239D I332E alemtuzumab are 0.99 0.60 and 0.49 respectively and therefore their respective EC50s are 9.9 4.0 and 3.0. Thus V264I I332E and S239E I332E provide a 2.5 fold and 3.3 fold enhancement respectively in ADCC over WT alemtuzumab using PBMCs expressing heterozygous V158 F158 Fc RIIIa. These data are summarized in Table 5 below.

In order to determine whether these ADCC enhancements are broadly applicable to antibodies select Fc variants were evaluated in the context of trastuzumab and rituximab. ADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT trastuzumab using two breast carcinoma target cell lines BT474 and Sk Br 3. shows a bar graph illustrating ADCC at 1 ng ml antibody. Results indicate that V264I and V264I I332E trastuzumab provide substantially enhanced ADCC compared to WT trastuzumab with the relative ADCC enhancements proportional to their binding improvements to Fc RIIIa as indicated by AlphaScreen assay and SPR. and show the dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration for select Fc variants. The EC50s obtained from the fits of these data and the relative fold improvements in ADCC are provided in Table 6 below. Significant ADCC improvements are observed for I332E trastuzumab when combined with A330L and A330Y. Furthermore S239D A330L I332E provides a substantial ADCC enhancement greater than 300 fold for PBMCs expressing homozygous F158 F158 Fc RIIIa relative to WT trastuzumab and S298A E333A K334A consistent with the Fc R binding data observed by the AlphaScreen assay and SPR.

ADCC assays were run on V264I I332E WT and S298A D333A K334A rituximab using WIL2 S lymphoma target cells. presents a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 1 ng ml antibody. Results indicate that V264I I332E rituximab provides substantially enhanced ADCC relative to WT rituximab as well as superior ADCC to S298A D333A K334A consistent with the Fc RIIIa binding improvements observed by AlphaScreen assay and SPR. and show the dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration for select Fc variants. The EC50s obtained from the fits of these data and the relative fold improvements in ADCC are provided in Table 7 below. As can be seen S239D I332E A330L rituximab provides greater than 900 fold enhancement in EC50 over WT for PBMCs expressing homozygous F158 F158 Fc RIIIa. The differences in ADCC enhancements observed for alemtuzumab trastuzumab and rituximab are likely due to the use of different PBMCs different antibodies and different target cell lines.

Thus far ADCC data has been normalized such that the lower and upper baselines of each Fc polypeptide are set to the minimal and maximal fluorescence signal for that specific Fc polypeptide typically being the fluorescence signal at the lowest and highest antibody concentrations respectively. Although presenting the data in this matter enables a straightforward visual comparison of the relative EC50s of different antibodies hence the reason for presenting them in this way important information regarding the absolute level of effector function achieved by each Fc polypeptide is lost. and present cell based ADCC data for trastuzumab and rituximab respectively that have been normalized according to the absolute minimal lysis for the assay provided by the fluorescence signal of target cells in the presence of PBMCs alone no antibody and the absolute maximal lysis for the assay provided by the fluorescence signal of target cells in the presence of Triton X1000. The graphs show that the antibodies differ not only in their EC50 reflecting their relative potency but also in the maximal level of ADCC attainable by the antibodies at saturating concentrations reflecting their relative efficacy. Thus far these two terms potency and efficacy have been used loosely to refer to desired clinical properties. In the current experimental context however they are denoted as specific quantities and therefore are here explicitly defined. By potency as used in the current experimental context is meant the EC50 of an Fc polypeptide. By efficacy as used in the current experimental context is meant the maximal possible effector function of an Fc polypeptide at saturating levels. In addition to the substantial enhancements to potency described thus far and show that the Fc variants of the present invention provide greater than 100 enhancements in efficacy over WT trastuzumab and rituximab.

Select Fc variants were validated for their Fc R binding and ADCC improvements in the context of two antibodies alemtuzumab and trastuzumab. Binding to human V158 Fc RIIIa was measured using both AlphaScreen and SPR as described above. Exemplary AlphaScreen data measuring Fc RIIIa binding are provided in . ADCC was carried out in the context of trastuzumab using Sk Br 3 target cells and LDH detection as described above. Exemplary ADCC data are provided in . Table 8 provides a summary of the fold Fc RIIIa binding affinities to relative to WT as determined by AlphaScreen and SPR and the fold ADCC relative to WT for a series of Fc variants in the context of alemtuzumab alem and trastuzumab trast .

A critical parameter governing the clinical efficacy of anti cancer antibodies is the expression level of target antigen on the surface of tumor cells. Thus a major clinical advantage of Fc variants that enhance ADCC may be that it enables the targeting of tumors that express lower levels of antigen. In order to test this hypothesis WT and Fc variant trastuzumab antibodies were tested for their ability to mediate ADCC against different cell lines expressing varying levels of the Her2 neu target antigen using the the DELFIA EuTDA method. Four cell lines cell lines expressing amplified to low levels of Her2 neu receptor were used including Sk Br 3 1 10copies SkOV3 1 10 OVCAR3 1 10 and MCF 7 3 10copies . Target cells were loaded with BATDA in batch for 25 minutes washed multiple times with medium and seeded at 10 000 cells per well in 96 well plates. Target cells were opsonized for 15 minutes with various antibodies and concentrations final conc. ranging from 100 ng ml to 0.0316 ng ml in log steps including no treatment control . Human PBMCs isolated from buffy coat and allotyped as homozygous F158 F158 Fc RIIIa were then added to opsonized cells at 25 fold excess and co cultured at 37 C. for 4 hrs. Thereafter plates were centrifuged supernatants were removed and treated with Eu3 solution and relative fluorescence units correlating to the level of cell lysis were measured using a Packard Fusion FP HT reader Perkin Elmer Boston Mass. . The experiment was carried out in triplicates. shows the ADCC data comparing WT and Fc variant trastuzumab against the four different Her2 neu cell lines. The S239D I332E and S239D I332E A330L variants provide substantial ADCC enhancements over WT trastuzumab at high moderate and low expression levels of target antigen. This result suggests that the Fc variants of the present invention may broaden the therapeutic window of anti cancer antibodies.

Natural killer NK cells are a subpopulation of cells present in PBMCs that are thought to play a significant role in ADCC. Select Fc variants were tested in a cell based ADCC assay in which natural killer NK cells rather than PBMCs were used as effector cells. In this assay the release of endogenous lactose dehydrogenase LDH rather than EuTDA was used to monitor cell lysis. shows that the Fc variants show substantial ADCC enhancement when NK cells are used as effector cells. Furthermore together with previous assays the results indicate that the Fc variants of the present invention show substantial ADCC enhancements regardless of the type of effector cell or the detection method used.

Another important Fc R mediated effector function is ADCP. Phagocytosis of target cancer cells may not only lead to the immediate destruction of target cells but because phagocytosis is a potential mechanism for antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells enhanced ADCP may also improve the capacity of the Fc polypeptide to elicit an adaptive immune response. The ability of the Fc variants of the present invention to mediate ADCP was therefore investigated. Monocytes were isolated from heterozygous V158 F158 Fc RIIIa PBMCs using a Percoll gradient. After one week in culture in the presence of 0.1 ng ml differentiated macrophages were detached with EDTA PBS and labeled with the lipophilic fluorophore PKH26 according to the manufacturer s protocol Sigma St Louis Mo. . Sk Br 3 target cells were labeled with PKH67 Sigma St Louis Mo. seeded in a 96 well plate at 20 000 cells per well and treated with designated final concentrations of WT or Fc variant trastuzumab. PKH26 labeled macrophages were then added to the opsonized labeled Sk Br 3 cells at 20 000 cells per well and the cells were co cultured for 18 hrs before processing cells for analysis of dual label flow cytometry. Percent phagocytosis was determined as the number of cells co labeled with PKH76 and PKH26 macrophage Sk Br 3 over the total number of Sk Br 3 in the population phagocytosed non phagocytosed after 10 000 counts. shows data comparing WT and Fc variant trastuzumab at various antibody concentrations. The results indicate that the S239D I332E A330L variant provides a significant enhancement in ADCP over WT trastuzumab.

Complement protein C1q binds to a site on Fc that is proximal to the Fc R binding site and therefore it was prudent to determine whether the Fc variants have maintained their capacity to recruit and activate complement. The AlphaScreen assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to the complement protein C1q. The assay was carried out with biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2 and using C1q coupled directly to acceptor beads. Binding data of V264I I332E S239E and V264I I332E rituximab shown in indicate that C1q binding is uncompromised. Cell based CDC assays were also performed on select Fc variants to investigate whether Fc variants maintain the capacity to activate complement. Alamar Blue was used to monitor lysis of Fc variant and WT rituximab opsonized WIL2 S lymphoma cells by human serum complement Quidel San Diego Calif. . The data in show that CDC is uncompromised for the Fc variants S239E V264I and V264I I332E rituximab. In contrast shows that CDC of the Fc variant S239D I332E A330L is completely ablated whereas the S239D I332E variant mediates CDC that is comparable to WT rituximab. These results indicate that protein engineering can be used to distinguish between different effector functions. Such control will not only enable the generation of Fc polypeptides including antibodies and Fc fusions with properties tailored for a desired clinical outcome but also provide a unique set of reagents with which to experimentally investigate effector function biology.

In order to evaluate the capacity of the Fc variants to enhance effector function in vivo a pre clinical study was carried out wherein B cell depletion was used to measure antibody cytotoxicity in cynomogus monkeys . Three monkeys per sample were injected intravenously with WT or S239D I332E rituximab antibody with injections given once daily over days 1 4 in approximate dose ranges of 40 g kg WT control or 1 4 10 or 40 g kg S239D I332E and or WT . Actual concentrations were determined experimentally. B cell and natural killer cell levels were monitored from days 5 to 28 and cell populations were counted using flow cytometry using B cell markers CD20 and CD40 and natural killer cell markers CD3 CD16 and CD3 CD8 .

Optimization of Fc to nonhuman Fc Rs may be useful for experimentally testing Fc variants in animal models. For example when tested in mice for example nude mice SCID mice xenograft mice and or transgenic mice antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse Fc Rs may provide valuable information with regard to clinical efficacy mechanism of action and the like. In order to evaluate whether the Fc variants of the present invention may be useful in such experiments affinity of select Fc variants for mouse Fc RIII was measured using the AlphaScreen assay. The AlphaScreen assay was carried out using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2 and GST tagged mouse Fc RIII bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads expressed and purified as described in Example 2. These binding data are shown in for Fc variants in the context of alemtuzumab and in and in the context of trastuzumab. Results show that some Fc variants that enhance binding to human Fc RIIIa also enhance binding to mouse Fc RIII. The enhancement of mouse effector function by the Fc variants was investigated by performing the aforementioned cell based ADCC assays using mouse rather than human PBMC s. shows that the S239D I332E A330L trastuzumab variant provides substantial ADCC enhancement over WT in the presence of mouse immune cells. This result indicates that the Fc variants of the present invention or other Fc variants that are optimized for nonhuman Fc Rs may find use in experiments that use animal models.

Whereas the Fc variants of the present invention were expressed in 293T cells for screening purposes large scale production of antibodies is typically carried out by expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cell lines. In order to evaluate the properties of CHO expressed Fc variants select Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab were expressed in CHO cells and purified as described in Example 1. shows AlphaScreen data comparing binding of CHO and 293T expressed Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab to human V158 Fc RIIIa. The results indicate that the Fc variants of the present invention show comparable Fc R binding enhancements whether expressed in 293T or CHO.

Combinations of the Fc variants of the present invention with other Fc modifications are contemplated with the goal of generating novel Fc polypeptides with optimized properties. It may be beneficial to combine the Fc variants of the present invention with other Fc modifications including modifications that alter effector function or interaction with one or more Fc ligands. Such combination may provide additive synergistic or novel properties in Fc polypeptides. For example a number of methods exist for engineering different glycoforms of Fc that alter effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by a variety of methods known in the art many of these techniques are based on controlling the level of fucosylated and or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region. One method for engineering Fc glycoforms is to express the Fc polypeptide in a cell line that generates altered glycoforms for example Lec 13 CHO cells. In order to investigate the properties of Fc variants combined with engineered glycoforms WT and V209 S239D I332E A330L trastuzumab were expressed in Lec 13 CHO cells and purified as described above. shows AlphaScreen binding data comparing the binding to human V158 Fc RIIIa by WT and V209 trastuzumab expressed in 293T CHO and Lec 13 cells. The results show that there is substantial synergy between the engineered glycoforms produced by this cell line and the Fc variants of the present invention. The cell based ADCC assay shown in supports this result. Together these data indicate that other Fc modifications particularly engineered glycoforms may be combined with the Fc variants of the present invention to generate Fc polypeptides for example antibodies and Fc fusions with optimized effector functions.

As discussed one goal of the current experiments was to obtain optimized aglycosylated Fc variants. Several Fc variants provide significant progress towards this goal. Because it is the site of glycosylation substitution at N297 results in an aglycosylated Fc. Whereas all other Fc variants that comprise a substitution at N297 completely ablate Fc R binding N297D I332E has significant binding affinity for Fc RIIIa shown in and illustrated in . The exact reason for this result is uncertain in the absence of a high resolution structure for this variant although the computational screening predictions suggest that it is potentially due to a combination of new favorable Fc Fc R interactions and favorable electrostatic properties. Indeed other electrostatic substitutions are envisioned for further optimization of aglycosylated Fc. shows that other aglycosylated Fc variants such as N297D A330Y I332E and S239D N297D I332E provide binding enhancements that bring affinity for Fc RIIIa within as much as 0.4 and 0.8 respectively of glycosylated WT alemtuzumab. Combinations of these variants with other Fc variants that enhance Fc R binding are contemplated with the goal of obtaining aglycosylated Fc variants that bind one or more Fc Rs with affinity that is approximately the same as or even better than glycosylated parent Fc. Preferred Fc variants for enhancing Fc ligand binding and or effector function in an aglycosylated Fc polypeptide include but are not limited to N297D N297D I332E N297D I332D S239D N297D S239D N297D I332E N297D A330Y I332E and S239D N297D A330Y I332E. The present invention of course contemplates combinations of these aglycosylated variants with other Fc variants described herein which also enhance Fc ligand binding and or effector function.

An additional set of promising Fc variants provide stability and solubility enhancements in the absence of carbohydrate. Fc variants that comprise substitutions at positions 241 243 262 and 264 positions that do not mediate Fc R binding but do determine the interface between the carbohydrate and Fc ablate Fc R binding presumably because they perturb the conformation of the carbohydrate. In deglycosylated form however Fc variants F241 E F243R V262E V264R F241 E F243Q V262T V264E F241 R F243Q V262T V264R and F241 E F243Y V262 T V264R show stronger binding to Fc RIIIa than in glycosylated form as shown by the AlphaScreen data in . This result indicates that these are key positions for optimization of the structure stability solubility and function of aglycosylated Fc. Together these results suggests that protein engineering can be used to restore the favorable functional and solution properties of antibodies and Fc fusions in the absence of carbohydrate and pave the way for aglycosylated antibodies and Fc fusions with favorable solution properties and full functionality that comprise substitutions at these and other Fc positions.

Taken together the data provided in the present invention indicate that Fc variants that provide optimized Fc R binding properties also provide enhanced effector function. Substitutions at a number of positions including but not limited to 236 239 246 246 249 255 258 260 264 267 268 272 274 281 283 304 324 326 327 330 332 333 334 and 334 provide promising candidates for improving the effector function and therefore the clinical properties of Fc polypeptides including antibodies and Fc fusions. Because combinations of Fc variants of the present invention have typically resulted in additive or synergistic binding improvements and accordingly additive or synergistic enhancements in effector function it is anticipated that as yet unexplored combinations of the Fc variants provided in will also provide favorable results. Preferred Fc variants of the present invention for enhancing Fc ligand binding and or effector function are provided in Table 9.

This list of preferred Fc variants is not meant to constrain the present invention. Indeed all combinations of the any of the Fc variants provided in are embodiments of the present invention. Furthermore combinations of any of the Fc variants of the present invention with other discovered or undiscovered Fc variants may also provide favorable properties and these combinations are also contemplated as embodiments of the present invention. Finally it is anticipated from these results that other substitutions at positions mutated in present invention may also provide favorable binding enhancements and specificities and thus substitutions at all positions in are contemplated.
