Formerly known as NAVSTAR the GPS incorporates a plurality of satellites which work with the earth in extremely precise orbits. Based on these precise orbits GPS satellites can relay their location to any number of receiving units.

The GPS system is implemented when a device specially equipped to receive GPS data begins scanning radio frequencies for GPS satellite signals. Upon receiving a radio signal from a GPS satellite the device determines the precise location of that satellite via one of a plurality of different conventional methods. The device will continue scanning in most instances for signals until it has acquired at least three different satellite signals noting that position is not normally but can be determined with only two signals using other triangulation techniques . Implementing geometric triangulation the receiver utilizes the three known positions to determine its own two dimensional position relative to the satellites. This can be done in a known manner. Additionally acquiring a fourth satellite signal will allow the receiving device to calculate its three dimensional position by the same geometrical calculation in a known manner. The position and velocity data can be updated in real time on a continuous basis by an unlimited number of users.

As shown in the GPS system is denoted generally by reference numeral . A plurality of satellites are in orbit about the earth . The orbit of each satellite is not necessarily synchronous with the orbits of other satellites and in fact is likely asynchronous. A GPS receiver usable in embodiments of navigation devices of the present application is shown receiving spread spectrum GPS satellite signals from the various satellites .

The spread spectrum signals continuously transmitted from each satellite utilize a highly accurate frequency standard accomplished with an extremely accurate atomic clock. Each satellite as part of its data signal transmission transmits a data stream indicative of that particular satellite . It is appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art that the GPS receiver device generally acquires spread spectrum GPS satellite signals from at least three satellites for the GPS receiver device to calculate its two dimensional position by triangulation. Acquisition of an additional signal resulting in signals from a total of four satellites permits the GPS receiver device to calculate its three dimensional position in a known manner.

According to embodiments of the present application a navigation device includes a receiver to receive multiple traffic message channels an input device to receive a user input indicating a frequency and a processor to select a traffic message channel based on a signal strength starting with the indicated frequency.

According to embodiments of the present application a navigation device includes a receiver to receive multiple traffic message channels an input device to receive a user input indicating a frequency and a processor to select a traffic message channel based on a planned route starting with the indicated frequency.

According to embodiments of the present application a method includes receiving multiple traffic message channels receiving a user input indicating a frequency and selecting a traffic message channel based on a signal strength starting with the indicated frequency.

According to embodiments of the present application a method includes receiving multiple traffic message channels receiving a user input indicating a frequency and selecting a traffic message channel based on a planned route starting with the indicated frequency.

According to embodiments of the present application a navigation device includes means for receiving multiple traffic message channels means for receiving a user input indicating a frequency and means for selecting a traffic message channel based on a signal strength starting with the indicated frequency.

According to embodiments of the present application a navigation device includes means for receiving multiple traffic message channels means for receiving a user input indicating a frequency and means for selecting a traffic message channel based on a planned route starting with the indicated frequency.

According to another aspect of the present application a navigation device includes a receiver for receiving multiple traffic message channels. A traffic message channel provides traffic and or travel information. The navigation device also includes an input device to receive a user input indicating a frequency. An example display for indicating a frequency is shown in and generally referenced . Example display is displayed on the navigation device . The user indicates using arrows and a starting frequency for the navigation device to select a traffic message channel. The frequency can be any frequency within the band in which the navigation device operates. The frequency may or may not be a frequency associated with a traffic message channel.

The navigation device includes a processor to select a traffic message channel based on a signal strength starting with the indicated frequency. After receiving the indicated frequency the processor included in the navigation device evaluates the signal strength of the indicated frequency. If no traffic message channel is associated with the indicated frequency or the signal strength is too weak the processor tunes to the next frequency at which a traffic message channel is available. The process continues until the processor selects a traffic message channel with sufficient signal strength. Accordingly the selected traffic message channel is not necessarily the strongest signal available to the navigation device .

It should be noted that each of the aforementioned aspects of an embodiment of the present application have been described with regard to the navigation device of the present application. However at least one embodiment of the present application is directed to a method for selecting a traffic message channel. The method includes receiving multiple traffic message channels receiving a user input indicating a frequency and selecting a traffic message channel based on a signal strength starting with the indicated frequency. Such a method can be used in one or more implementations of a navigation device as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. Thus further explanation is omitted for the sake of brevity.

In another embodiment of the present application a processor included in a navigation device can select a traffic message channel based on a planned route starting with the indicated frequency. In some applications of at least one embodiment the receiver to receive multiple traffic channels provides the processor with additional information in selecting a traffic message channel. In one example the processor can select the one of the multiple traffic message channels based on a current location of a user along the planned route. The processor selects the traffic message channel based on the indicated frequency the current location of the user and information included in the navigation device regarding traffic message channels. As such the navigation device can select a traffic message channel without measuring the signal strength of one or more traffic message channels.

In other implementations a receiver can be integrated with other components of the navigation device such as processor as shown in . The receiver includes a traffic message channel antenna internal to the navigation device as shown. In one implementation of at least one embodiment an antenna included in receiver can extend beyond the navigation device . Accordingly the antenna can be mounted to an automobile window or a different location to maximize reception of a traffic message channel depending on the particular implementation of the navigation device . In other implementations a traffic message channel antenna receiver can be a modular addition to a navigation device such that the traffic message channel antenna receiver can be acquired separately from a navigation device . The modular traffic message channel antenna receiver can subsequently be incorporated or installed into the navigation device .

In another example the processor can select the one of the multiple traffic message channels based on an expected signal strength along the planned route. If the navigation device includes information associated with the multiple traffic message channels the navigation device can predict the signal strength of a traffic message channel along a planned route. By selecting a traffic message channel based on this information the navigation device can select a traffic message channel to minimize the number of traffic message channel changes along a planned route.

Example display also includes an input option to manage traffic message channels. When the navigation device receives an input to manage channels the navigation device displays example display as shown in . Example display illustrates options available to a user of the navigation device to manage traffic message channels. Managing the traffic message channel includes designating at least one traffic message channel as preferred or blocked. When a channel is designated preferred the user may have determined the preferred traffic message channel provides better information or more relevant information to the user s particular preferences. In one implementation of at least one embodiment the processor can select the one of the multiple traffic message channels based on at least the designation. The designation can be either preferred or blocked. For example a processor can select a frequency associated with a preferred traffic channel. Additional other designations may be incorporated in other implementations. For example a designation may include a degree of preferred such that a processor can select one preferred traffic message channel over another preferred traffic message channel.

In further reference to example display a user can remove a designation of a traffic message channel by providing an input to either remove a preferred channel or unblock a blocked channel. In response to the input the navigation device displays example display as shown in . The example display allows the user to scroll up down to view the preferred blocked traffic message channels. As shown in each entry of a preferred blocked traffic message channel can include a user defined name description and or a country designator such as a flag as shown. The user can select one of the traffic message channels to undesignate the traffic message channel. In response to the user input the navigation device removes the designation of the traffic message channel.

In some embodiments of the present application a display device can be included in a navigation device to display information about a traffic message channel selected by a processor . For example a display device can display a name associated with the selected traffic message channel. As shown in example display the name of the traffic message channel is Sky radio. Displaying the name of a traffic message channel is one aspect of at least one embodiment because the name associated with a traffic message channel is often easier to remember and recall than a frequency of a traffic message channel. The name of the traffic message channel can be provided to the navigation device from the user or via the traffic message channel. In one example a navigation device includes an input device to receive an input indicating a name to a traffic message channel. Example display illustrated an input keyboard for a user to type in the name of a traffic message channel. The name is stored in memory associated with the navigation device . When the channel is selected the navigation device displays the name of the traffic message channel as entered by the user on a display device . As illustrated in example display the input device and the display device can be included in an integrate input and display device .

In another example the name is extracted from the traffic messages received from the traffic message channel. When the selected traffic message traffic channel provides multiple traffic messages each traffic message includes multiple segments. The processor determines the name of the selected traffic message based on a number of like segments in multiple traffic messages received via the receiver. In other words a traffic message channel includes its name in a segment of each traffic message sent. The processor increments a counter for each like segment. Because the name is included in most and or every traffic message the corresponding counter will have the highest value after an interval. Accordingly the processor determines the name of the traffic message channel based on the counters the segment with the highest count being associated with the name of the traffic message channel.

In another implementation of at least one embodiment a navigation device can use a counter to select a different traffic message channel. As stated above traffic message channels send multiple traffic messages. Generally as traffic or travel information is updated additional traffic messages are sent. A processor included in a navigation device increments a counter for each traffic message received. As multiple traffic messages are received the value in the counter grows. Also the processor decrements the counter for each interval in which no traffic message is received. The processor can also decrement the counter at the interval if a traffic message is received. When the counter reaches a value the processor selects a different traffic message channel. The value can be any value depending on the implementation of the navigation device . For example the value can be zero. The processor essentially prevents the navigation device from being stuck on a traffic message channel that is not transmitting traffic messages.

In one example a counter can be incremented by 1 for each traffic message received and the counter can also be decremented by 1 every two seconds. The counter is set to a value of 60 when a traffic message channel is selected and the maximum value of the counter is one hundred 100 . If no traffic messages are received the counter will reach zero in two minutes causing the processor to select a different channel. If the traffic message channel provides ten messages in five seconds the counter will be incremented by ten and decremented by five leaving the counter at 65. And so on. The counter will continue incrementing decrementing until a value is reached and a different traffic message channel is selected. Again the counter continually ensures a navigation device does not become stuck on a traffic message channel providing little or not traffic or travel information. In another example the processor can compare the traffic messages received from a traffic message channel. If the traffic messages are the same the processor may not increment the counter i.e. receiving the same information over and over is essentially receiving no information. If the traffic message continues to be redundant the processor will eventually select a different traffic message channel.

A traffic message channel generally provides information in a uniform standard. In one implementation of at least one embodiment a navigation device receives traffic messages from a traffic message channel according to a radio data system RDS standard. In another implementation of at least one embodiment a navigation device receives traffic messages from a traffic message channel according to a radio broadcast data system RBDS standard. In still other implementation of at least one embodiment other systems standards can be included such as DAB SDARS GPRS etc.

According to another aspect of the present application a navigation system for selecting a traffic message channel includes a receiver to determine a signal strength of a traffic message channel at at least one location and a memory to store information representing the signal strength of a traffic message channel. The navigation system also includes at least one processor to correlate the information stored in memory to compile a traffic message channel resource and select a traffic message channel based on the traffic message channel resource and a location associated with a navigation device . As the amount of correlated information increases the traffic message resource becomes increasingly useful as a basis for the at least one processor to select the traffic message channel.

It should be noted that each of the aforementioned aspects of an embodiment of the present application have been described with regard to the navigation device of the present application. However at least one embodiment of the present application is directed to a method for selecting a traffic message channel. The method includes determining a signal strength of a traffic message channel at a location storing information representing the signal strength of a traffic message channel correlating the information stored in memory to compile a traffic message channel resource and selecting a traffic message channel based on the traffic message channel resource and a location associated with a navigation device . Such a method can be used in one or more implementations of a navigation device as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. Thus further explanation is omitted for the sake of brevity.

In one implementation of at least one embodiment the at least one processor can be a first processor to correlate information stored in memory to compile the traffic message channel resource. The at least one processor can also be a second processor to select a traffic message channel based on the traffic message channel resource and a current location of a navigation device . The first processor and second processor can be the same processor in a navigation device . In another embodiment the first processor can be a processor included in a central system and the second processor can be a processor included in a navigation device . In other embodiments the first processor and second processor can be included in another device of the navigation system. For example a first processor can be included in a first navigation device and the second device can be included in a second navigation device.

The at least one processor selects a traffic message channel based on a location associated with a navigation device . The location can be a number of locations. In one implementation of at least one embodiment the location is a current location of a navigation device . The traffic message channel resource and the current location of the navigation device allow the processor to select a traffic message signal without measuring a signal strength of the selected traffic message channel. The navigation device can also measure the signal strength of the traffic message channel and or provide a traffic message counter as described above. In another implementation of at least one embodiment the location associated with the navigation device can be an expected location of a navigation device . The expected location can be used to select a traffic message channel to among other things minimize traffic message channel changes along a planned route.

The at least one processor may also select a traffic message channel based on one or more of a radio station location a radio station coverage a planned route information provided by another navigation device user and information provided by the traffic message channel. A traffic message channel is broadcast from a radio station. A location and a coverage of a radio station can indicate without measuring a sufficient signal strength of a traffic message channel. This information and other relevant information can be provided by the traffic message channel provider. Other information may include a PI code a country code a service provider ID an AF supplied in RDS and or TMC channel an access rights a subscription a price associated with a traffic message channel a message geographical scope etc. Additionally a user of a navigation device can provide information such as measured signal strengths at particular locations.

According to another aspect of the present application a navigation system for providing a traffic message channel resource includes an input device to receive information relating to multiple traffic message channels from each traffic message channel provider and a processor to create a traffic message channel resource from the information. The traffic message channel resource designates at least one preferred traffic message channel for multiple locations in a coverage area.

It should be noted that each of the aforementioned aspects of an embodiment of the present application have been described with regard to the navigation device of the present application. However at least one embodiment of the present application is directed to a method for providing a traffic message channel resource. The method includes receiving information relating to multiple traffic message channels from each traffic message channel provider and creating a traffic message channel resource from the information. The traffic message channel resource designates at least one preferred traffic message channel for multiple locations in a coverage area. Such a method can be used in one or more implementations of a navigation device as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. Thus further explanation is omitted for the sake of brevity.

The traffic message resource is created from the information about the multiple traffic message channels. As the amount of information increases the traffic message resource becomes increasingly useful to a user of a navigation device included in the navigation system. The navigation device can select a traffic message channel based on the traffic message channel resource and one of a current location and a location associated with the navigation device such as a planned route described above.

Based on the information provided the traffic message channel resource designates at least one traffic message channel as preferred. Designating the traffic message channel as preferred can be based on at least one of a radio station location a radio station coverage a planned route and information provided by a user of a navigation device . Any of these types of information can be used singly or in combination in a number of implementations. Also a particular implementation may depend on one type of information over another. For example a traffic message channel resource based on radio station location may have little or no use for information related to a planned route of a user. In another implementation of at least one embodiment a user of a navigation device can also designate at least one traffic channel as one of preferred and blocked. The designation can even be provided by a user of a different navigation device .

In one implementation of at least one embodiment a navigation system can provide the traffic message channel resource to at least one user. In such an implementation the traffic message channel resource would be correlated by a central system . A user of the navigation system is a user of a navigation device . The navigation device utilizes the traffic message channel resource provided by the central system to select a traffic message channel. For example the navigation device can select a traffic message channel based on the traffic message channel resource and the user s location within the coverage area. The navigation system can provide the traffic message channel resource as an optional feature to the user of a navigation device . As an additional feature the traffic message channel resource can be updated at regular intervals e.g. monthly or semi annually.

In another implementation of at least one embodiment the navigation system can include a navigation device which includes the input device to receive information and the processor to create a traffic message channel resource from the information. The creation of the traffic message resource on a navigation device allows the user to customize the traffic message channel resource. The user can provide any of the information disclosed above such as a user designation or a radio station coverage from which the traffic message channel resource is created.

The methods of at least one embodiment expressed above may be implemented as a computer data signal embodied in the carrier wave or propagated signal that represents a sequence of instructions which when executed by a processor such as processor of server and or processor of navigation device for example causes the processor to perform a respective method.
