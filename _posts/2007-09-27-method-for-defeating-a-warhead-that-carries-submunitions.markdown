Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119 the benefit of priority from provisional application 60 854 460 with a filing date of Sep. 29 2006 is claimed for this non provisional application.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to damage infliction on target structures. In particular the invention relates to enhanced damage to submunitions and rupture of warhead targets carrying submunitions.

The United States Missile Defense Agency MDA is developing defense systems to intercept threat re entry vehicles in their terminal stage of flight. The vehicle payloads may contain a large number of submunitions to be spread over a targeted territory. A typical submunition is a small breakable metal container filled with a chemical or biological agent. Several approaches are considered by the MDA to defeat the reentry vehicles.

Conventional methods yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Such disadvantages include external impact causing breakage of a number of submunitions. In particular various embodiments provide for damaging the warhead s outer shell to rupture so as to compromise its aerodynamic characteristics and thereby cause its submunitions to be scattered prior to reaching the target.

Various exemplary embodiments provide a method for destroying a target that includes dispersing pressure releasing fragments in an array that is directed to intercept the target and engaging the fragments to collide against an outer shell of the target wherein the array distributes the fragments as having a ratio between a characteristic length of the fragments and a separation distance of at most 2.5 and a collision velocity of between 1.8 km s and 2.0 km s.

In various other embodiments the ratio is preferably at most 1.9. The characteristic length corresponds to an equivalent spherical radius of the fragment. Each fragment has a mass between 150 grains and 300 grains. The array is preferably aligned to intercept the target at an angle offset by between 15 and 45 from perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the target. Each fragment has a preferable shape of a prism a trapezoid or a pyramid.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Conventional methods of defeating submunition filled payloads are based on kinetic kill vehicles KKV . A solid object namely the KKV strikes the target at optimal angle and location to inflict damage to a maximum number of submunitions. This method has several limitations including lack of operational flexibility in view of sparse intelligence information regarding foreign submunitions development. Some submunitions are made of thin aluminum shells and require only modest collision to destroy while others are robust thick walled steel containers.

Another difficulty involves definining optimal angles and locations for the KKV impact. Conventionally a large KKV is desired to ensure target destruction but the KKV s inertia at a typical speed near 2 km s adversely influences maneuverability.

Various exemplary embodiments can be used as enhancement to the existing KKV based defeat systems. Also these can be used against other thin walled structures and vehicles including boats and ships where perforation of a large hole is desirable. As described herein various exemplary embodiments incorporate arrays of pressure releasing penetrators hitting the target almost simultaneously. The penetrators may be spaced to form a row or another pattern maximizing the extent of the impact region. Several damage mechanisms can be thereby produced.

Advantages from these embodiments include 1 Perforation of the vehicle skin and submunitions due to direct hit by the penetrators. 2 Submunition damage due to inter impacts. 3 Rupture and opening of aeroshell skin along the perforated holes due to internal overpressure. 4 Submunition expulsion through the skin openings under overpressure. 5 Loss of the target aerodynamic properties due to the structural damage.

Various exemplary embodiments provide for improved disabling of a target by multiple projectiles. In particular these embodiments enable stress concentrations from the projectiles to produce structural failure of the target. shows an elevation view of a target being approached by several submunitions . shows an elevation view of the target after colliding with the submunitions with portions of its outer shell or sheath being opened thereby causing premature release of its delivery contents as well as disruption of its aerodynamic characteristics. Arrays of pressure releasing fragments can be used to induce cracking and petal unfurling of the target s aeroshell skin. Such submunitions can be contained and dispersed by a launched projectile directed to intercept the target .

Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that collision damage to a target depends on impact speed based on its relationship to momentum. shows a graph that provides experimental data for number of cracks in a target shell as a function of impact speed in m s . The abscissa represents the impact speed whereas the ordinate represents the cracks number. A dash line represents a curve fit for the measured data. As can be observed below about 45 m s at most only one crack develops whereas a plateau of six cracks appear above 50 m s which represents a threshold for the conditions tested.

The experimental data were obtained for spheroid target and projectile geometries all approximately one inch in diameter. The projectile spheroid is directed towards the target spheroids disposed on a rigid flat surface.

Example values for aluminum structures is 0.11 505 MPa 291 kg m C 1.2 for aluminum C 0.3 for an example sub munition Ccan range from 0.8 to 1.1 for a single sub munition between 41 m s and 55 m s and from 1.4 to 1.9 two to four submunitions between 68 m s and 95 m s .

Although a variety of geometric shapes can be employed for fragments greater damage to a target s shell typically results from shapes with sharp corners at which stress concentrations can be initiated upon contact with the target. Such preferable shapes include the prism trapezoid and pyramid.

To propagate a crack within the target shell an analysis provides information on stress concentration for a plate in an infinite plane shown in with uniform tensile stress applied. An elliptical opening is disposed amid the horizontal and vertical axes xand x. A line representing a potential crack extends from one side of the opening extending to an end point at which may be calculated. The opening has a longitudinal length of along the xaxis. The line for the potential crack has a length r.

The tensile stresses can be calculated in the horizontal and vertical directions with the Westergaard s stress function Zfor each mode i 1 2 representing the axes. Shear stress and the Mode I stress intensity factor Kcan also be calculated. Square diagrams and illustrate the respective horizontal vertical and shear stress orientations. These functional relations can be expressed as Re Z xIm Z a 2r cos 2 1 sin 2 sin 3 2 Re Z xIm Z a 2r cos 2 1 sin 2 sin 3 2 xRe Z a 2r sin 2 cos 2 cos 3 2 K a Iim Z a where a represents opening longitudinal length r represents crack length is a complex variable representing length of the line from the closet end of the opening to the end point on the plate is the angle from the xaxis at the edge of the opening to the point on the plate and represents the uniform static load. The complex stress function Zdepends on variable as an independent parameter while Z represents the first derivative of Zwith respect to . The real and imaginary portions are denoted by Re and Im functions. Stress intensity factor for Mode I Kis proportional to the stress and the square root of crack length.

Stress rapidly increases with decreased distance between cracks. Desired distance b between openings is less than the opening length a multiplied by a factor of 1.5 or b 1.5a. This analytical solution suggests that the stress concentration can be enhanced by increasing the crack length and reducing the distance between the cracks.

Similarly in a target with its intersection is approached by a projectile on a collision course angularly offset from the intersection by 45 . The projectile has an inertia defined by mValong an intercept direction . Upon contact with the target the projectile produces an opening . Tests were conducted with angular offsets of alternately 15 and 45 .

For these tests fragment speed was between about 1.8 and 2.0 km s. Tests results show that impact obliquity produces greater stress concentration for the elliptical opening at 45 angle than the near round opening at 15 angle. Spherical fragments are measured in grains in which 100 grains 6.5 grams. The spherical fragments had masses of 150 grains and 300 grains. The number of fragments ranged from 1 through 8 and the fragments were arranged as one row and two rows.

These data represent point for 4 300 for 8 150 for 3 300 for 4 150 as well as 6 300 and for 2 300. From this information increasing the probability of target failure correlates with increasing overpressure P which is achievable by increasing the number and size of penetrators using more efficient materials and to decrease the distances between perforated openings.

Cracking between closely positioned holes appears to be due to direct impact or after release of a moderate amount of pressurized gas. Petal opening or complete skin stripping after releasing large amount of pressurized gas. From the tests cracking occurred between closely located larger holes. Small cracks or no cracks occurred between the holes located at a larger distance from each other. The target contained a surrogate structure inside and was perforated by fragments line cracking small crack and indentation from small fragments.

Six 150 grain fragments having impact speed of 1.8 2.0 km s with fairly large spacing caused minor damage. Minor damage was produced after impact by four 150 grain fragments with large spacing in a single row array and impact speed of 1.8 2.0 km s. Catastrophic damage after impact was produced by eight 150 grain fragments with large spacing in a two row array and impact peed of km s. Partial skin pealing after impact by three 300 grain fragments with impact speed of 1.9 2.0 km s. Catastrophic failure of the target with the skin blown fifty yards away resulted from impact by four 300 grain fragments at impact speed of 1.9 2.0 km s. Maximum damage to the target was achieved using four 300 grain fragments at 45 obliquity and eight 150 grain fragments at 15 obliquity. The skin was completely stripped off in these cases.

Small spacing between penetators and increased penetrator size are important for inducing crack propagation between perforated openings. Angles of obliquity 15 and 45 do not seem to influence the damage level. This can be explained by the contribution from the two opposite trends at 15 impact fragments tend to transfer less impulse to the target skin and probably deliver a smaller amount of penetrator material inside of the target s shell. However the perforated opening is a longer ellipse with a higher stress concentration as compared to rounder openings seen from the 45 impacts.

To correlate the fragments with the openings analogous length parameters can be determined. A characteristic length dimension of a typical fragment e.g. a mean diameter within a distribution of fragments can be compared to the length of the punctured openings in the target s shell. An average distance between fragments can be assumed to correspond to the distance between opening centers. Photographs of openings in the shell at collision velocity i.e. relative difference between fragments and target of 1.9 km s show a typical opening length of a 1 inch 2.5 cm and array distances of b 2 inches 5 cm where cracks connected the openings and b 3.5 to 4 inches 9 to 10 cm without cracks connecting the openings. Empirically this indicates a ratio of opening to distance lengths of b a 2 for producing cracks but that for b a

Fragment dimensions can be analyzed with respect to the masses of fragments tested. Fragments of 150 grains and 300 grains were used. These correspond to 9.75 grams and 19.5 grams respectively. Aluminum has a material density of 291 kg m 0.291 g cm. A sphere has a volume defined by v 4 r 3 m p where r is fragment radius m is fragment mass and is material density. Thus r 3m 4 2 cm for this example.

The relationship between fragment radius and opening length can be characterized as a ratio of r a 0.8 and cracks appear to be preferably propagated when b 5 cm as a ratio r b 0.4 in which crack length is assumed to be substantially synonymous with the separation distance i.e. spacing between fragments. The previously obtained correlation b 1.5a can also be supplemented as by dividing the relations between opening and fragment as b a r a1.5 0.8 1.9 for the stress calculations. This is confirmed by the absence of cracks in photographs with larger spacing between fragments in which the ratio as b a r a b r

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
