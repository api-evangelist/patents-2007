This invention claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 762 561 filed Jan. 13 2006 and which is entitled ANTI BALLISTIC COMPOSITE STRUCTURE FOR ORDNANCE by Khosrow Nematollahi and Brian Ream.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates to an explosive ordnance handling and transport system and more particularly to a composite structure and shipping container that is ballistic resistant and protects the ordnance.

Recently there has been an emphasis on compliance with Insensitive Munitions IM standards as part of an effort to improve the safety of explosives and energetic materials. Military products are manufactured shipped and stored at various locations throughout the world. The increasing threat of terrorist attacks on military installations and public infrastructure has driven all branches of the military to assess the safety of existing ordnance handling and transport systems and products under their area of responsibility.

Tests that address the various threats to explosive ordnance transport include the impact of bullets on the Insensitive Munitions fragment impact slow cook off fast cook off and sympathetic detonation. IM compliance and hazard classification testing addresses the safety of the product relative to transportation storage and system vulnerability over the entire life cycle of the product.

The bullet impact test is considered the most difficult to pass with the Insensitive Munitions because of the severity of the test. More particularly one aspect of Insensitive Munitions compliance is to assess the reaction of the device relative to the standard attack threat of a 0.50 caliber M2 armor piercing bullet.

As such a need exists to improve the IM compliance for handling of explosive ordnance and energetic material especially ballistic resistance to M2 armor piercing bullets.

Accordingly it is a primary object and general purpose of the present invention to provide a composite structure that improves IM compliance for explosive ordnance and energetic material.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a composite structure that is ballistic resistant to armor piercing bullets.

It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a composite structure that maintains a comparatively safer environment for the transportation handling and storage of explosive and ordnance energetic materials.

It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a comparatively thin and lightweight anti ballistic composite structure.

It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a comparatively thin and lightweight and anti ballistic composite structure capable of stopping a 0.50 caliber armor piercing bullet.

In order to attain the objects described above there is provided a composite structure that can be used in conjunction with a similarly designed shipping container to protect explosive ordnance or an explosive device. The composite structure comprises a first inner ceramic layer with a first polyurethane layer encompassing the inner ceramic layer. A third layer is a 316L stainless steel layer encompassing the first polyurethane layer. A fourth layer is a second polyurethane layer encompassing the stainless steel layer. A fifth layer is an outer ceramic layer and a sixth layer through a tenth layer comprises five layers of interconnected aramid fiber fabric i.e. Kevlar available from DuPont impregnated with polyurethane.

Since the explosive ordnance is typically transported inside a shipping container the composite structure may be part of an explosive handling system to include a complimentary designed shipping container. In design the shipping container comprises additional layers to encompass the composite structure. A first layer of the shipping container is made of steel encompassing the composite structure.

A second layer through a fifteenth layer of the shipping container is each KEVLAR in which each layer is impregnated with polyurethane. Both the composite structure and the shipping container can be made from commercially available off the shelf products known to those skilled in the art.

The application of the composite structure of the present invention can result in cost savings for shipping tracking and logistics. With minor modifications recognizable by those skilled in the art the technology of the composite structure of the present invention can be customized for other weapon systems requiring Insensitive Munitions IM compliance.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to a composite structure is shown that is used to protect explosive ordnance or a device . The composite structure shown in the figures generally comprises concentric cylindrical layers of ceramic polyurethane stainless steel and interconnected aramid fiber fabric layers i.e. Kevlar available from DuPont . The composite structure may be other shapes than cylindrical with minor modifications recognizable by those ordinarily skilled in the art.

As shown in the cross sectional view of a first layer is an inner ceramic layer with a thickness of at least 0.46 inches. The inner ceramic layer is preferably ninety percent high density alumina. In a cylindrical form the inner ceramic layer preferably has an inside diameter ID of 3.25 inches however a nominal dimension of 3.0 inches ID and a 4.0 inch outside diameter OD with a tolerance of 1 16 inches can be used for the inner ceramic layer.

A second layer is a first polyurethane layer encompassing the inner ceramic layer . The first polyurethane layer has a thickness of at least 0.09 inches and is preferably a polyether based polyurethane resin i.e. Conathane EN 1556 available from Cytec Industries Inc. however suitable and commercially available materials known to those skilled in the art may be substituted.

A third layer is a 316L stainless steel layer with a thickness of at least 0.40 inches. The stainless steel layer encompasses the first polyurethane layer . In a cylindrical form the stainless steel layer preferably has an inside diameter of 4.10 inches and an outside diameter of 4.90 inches.

A fourth layer is a second polyurethane layer encompassing the stainless steel layer with a thickness of at least 0.03 inches. The second polyurethane layer is preferably CONATHANE EN 1556 polyurethane.

A fifth layer is a second or outer ceramic layer of preferably ninety percent high density alumina with a thickness of at least 1.00 inch. In a cylindrical form the second ceramic layer preferably has an ID of 4.96 inches however a nominal dimension of 5.0 inches ID and 7.0 inches O.D. with a tolerance of 1 16 inch can be used for the outer or second ceramic layer.

A sixth layer through a tenth layer comprises five layers of KEVLAR fabric impregnated with polyurethane. The sixth through tenth layers are KEVLAR polyurethane layers and . The thickness of each of the layers is at least 0.08 inches. Five layers of KEVLAR fabric with polyurethane are the least amount of layers that can be applied however additional layers of KEVLAR with polyurethane may be used.

Since the explosive ordnance is typically transported inside a shipping container the composite structure may be part of an explosive handling system to include a complimentary designed shipping container . The role of the shipping container is to decelerate a bullet by about twenty five percent and to decelerate any other projectiles approaching the explosive device . In design the shipping container comprises additional layers to encompass the composite structure .

A first layer of the shipping container is made of steel with a thickness of approximately 0.10 inches. The first layer encompasses the composite structure . In a cylindrical form the first layer of steel preferably has an ID of 10.5 inches.

A second layer through a fifteenth layer of the shipping container including a third layer a fourth layer a fifth layer a sixth layer a seventh layer an eighth layer a ninth layer a tenth layer an eleventh layer a twelfth layer a thirteenth layer and a fourteenth layer are each KEVLAR fabric in which each layer is impregnated with polyurethane. Each of the layers through has a thickness of 0.08 inches with a total thickness of 1.20 inches. Both the composite structure and the shipping container can be made from commercially available off the shelf products known to those skilled in the art.

The composite structure and the shipping container whether alone or in combination provide an effective thin and lightweight and anti ballistic or ballistic resistant structure for the protection of explosive ordnance or devices.

The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching.
