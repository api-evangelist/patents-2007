title: Air cushion vehicle bow skirt retraction system
abstract: A system and method retracts and lets-out a laterally extending flexible bow seal on an air cushion vehicle having a bow ramp. Attachment loops on the forward outside surface of the bow seal receive a skirt cable. A separate cable routing system is connected to opposite ends of the skirt cable for selectively retracting and letting-out the bow seal. The cable routing systems also include ramp cables connected to the bow ramp to raise or lower the bow ramp. The cable routing systems retract the bow seal with the skirt cable simultaneously as the bow ramp is lowered by letting out the ramp cables, and the cable routing systems let-out the bow seal with the skirt cable simultaneously as the bow ramp is raised by drawing in the ramp cables.

This invention relates to high speed marine vehicles utilizing air cushion principles to increase performance. More particularly this invention is for an air cushion vehicle such as a surface effect ship or hovercraft having a bow ramp and forward flexible seal provided with means for mechanically retracting the forward flexible seal to prevent its contact and damage between the vehicle and an off loading surface.

Both the surface effect ship SES and hovercraft are types of high speed marine vehicles referred to as air cushioned vehicles ACV . They ride on pressurized cushions of air that separate the vehicle from the surface over which it operates. This permits much lower drag and allows greater speeds to be achieved when compared to conventional displacement hulls of equivalent power. The air cushion is contained beneath the vehicle by a flexible skirt seal system which conforms to the irregular operating surface. The seal provided by this skirt reduces the flow of air escaping from the cushion. These vehicles may also utilize a swinging bow ramp for entry and exit of cargo.

In order to maintain performance in increasing sea states the height of the skirt and total amount of skirt material must be increased to prevent contact between the vehicle and the waves to avoid creating additional drag. Also in order to maintain proper forward cushion stability during impacts of waves the laterally extending bag or seal at the bow must increase in diameter as well. The technology push into operation at higher sea states is causing the skirt seals of the craft to be made even larger. This direction in the design of air cushion vehicles creates a problem during landing and loading unloading operations as the skirt deflates and the excess bag material of the front seal comes to rest along the sides and front of the vehicle. When the bow ramp is lowered to allow transit of vehicles on or off the craft the landing pads of the lowered bow ramp can contact and rest on the slack bow bag resulting in significant wear and or puncture damage. The traversing of heavy vehicles such as tanks going on and off the craft increase this damage rate and create possible further damage by pinching the flexible seal between the ramp and underlying land or dock surface. As the performance envelope for ACVs continues to drive toward increasing sea states and increasing skirt heights the vulnerability of skirt damage due to ramp systems and the corresponding costs to replace damaged skirts will increase.

Some vehicles are currently equipped with skirt retraction aids utilizing elastic cords that extend across and are attached on the inside of the skirt. The elastic cords develop tension by being elongated during inflation of the skirt seal. Once the flow of air is stopped the skirt will deflate under its own weight and the residual tension in the elastic cords causes the bow seal to fold over on itself away from the lowering bow ramp thus providing the necessary clearance. However these currently deployed skirt retraction systems have limited life due to the operating environment. The constant exposure to salt and vibration of the skirt while underway plus vibration due to wave impacts degrades the material of the elastic cords over time. Another problem with the current system is that elastic materials stretch linearly as a function of displacement. As the diameter of bow skirt seals become larger and more massive the length and required tension must increase accordingly to effectively function. Depending on the specific geometry of the bow seal corrosion and oil resistance elastic materials may or may not be able to satisfy the elongation verses tension requirements particularly on the larger seals.

Thus in accordance with this inventive concept a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a system for reliably retracting the flexible seal at the bow of an air cushion vehicle during off loading at the water land interface to reduce the possibility of damage and or undue wear of the seal.

The present invention provides a system and method for retracting and letting out a laterally extending flexible bow seal on an air cushion vehicle having a bow ramp. Attachment loops on the forward outside surface of the laterally extending flexible bow seal receive an elongate skirt cable. A separate cable routing system is connected to opposite ends of the elongate skirt cable for retracting and letting out the laterally extending flexible bow seal. Cable routing systems also connect ramp cables to the bow ramp to draw in ramp cables to raise the bow ramp or let out the ramp cables to lower the bow ramp onto a surface. Cable routing systems retract the flexible bow seal with the skirt cable simultaneously as the bow ramp is lowered with let out ramp cables or the cable routing systems let out the flexible bow seal with the skirt cable simultaneously as the bow ramp is raised with drawn in ramp cables. Each cable routing system includes a fixed pulley and a moveable pulley displaceable toward and away from the fixed pulley by a linear actuator. Each moveable pulley is displaced by a separate linear actuator of each cable routing system toward its associated fixed pulley to simultaneously retract the laterally extending flexible bow seal with the skirt cable and lower the bow ramp with let out ramp cables to allow the bow ramp to rest on a support surface. Each moveable pulley can also be displaced by a separate linear actuator of each cable routing system away from its associated fixed pulley to simultaneously let out the laterally extending flexible bow seal with the skirt cable and raise the bow ramp with drawn in ramp cables to a position above the vehicle.

An object of the invention is to provide a system and method for preventing damage to a flexible seal laterally extending from port to starboard across the bow of an air cushion vehicle.

These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.

Referring to bow skirt seal retraction system of the invention extends across the bow from port side to starboard side of an air cushion vehicle . Retraction system selectively retracts an elongate essentially tubular shaped laterally extending flexible bow seal connected along elongate juncture to the bow from port to starboard side to prevent pinching or excessive abrading of flexible bow seal during on loading or off loading of vehicle .

Tubular shaped flexible bow seal is an enlarged portion of a coextensive tubular flexible seal connected around the lower periphery of vehicle and depending overlapping finger shaped strips connected to seals and help contain a pressurized air cushion that supports vehicle . Flexible bow and coextensive seals and and strips are typically made from rubber coated or rubber impregnated strong flexible fabric materials or equivalent compositions to interface with water surface and land surface to maintain air cushion on water or land. Sufficient volumes of pressurized air are created and maintained for air cushion by well known machinery on vehicle to support propel vehicle across water and land.

Referring also to a bow ramp laterally extends from port to starboard across the bow of vehicle for off loading or on loading vehicles and personnel between vehicle and land surface . Bow ramp is hinged or pivotally mounted at its opposite ends and to vehicle in at least one hinge structure to permit bi directional rotation of ramp to an upward extending position during on cushion transit of vehicle as shown in or to a lowered position during off loading or on loading while vehicle is off cushion as shown in .

Bow skirt seal retraction system of the invention has two separate cable routing systems each located at opposite ends of ramp and mounted on vehicle via a base portion . Each routing system extends and secures a ramp cable to an outboard end of bow ramp from around a fixed pulley rotatably mounted on base portion . Each ramp cable is also wrapped about a displaceable pulley of each routing system and secured to base portion at an anchor point .

A separate bidirectional actuator is secured to each base portion of each routing system and is each connected to a separate displaceable pulley to linearly displace it in opposite directions toward and away from each fixed pulley . Actuators might be appropriately coupled hydraulic piston mechanisms that can be actuated to forcefully displace displaceable pulleys either toward or away from the interconnected fixed pulley and in the process pay out or reel in lengths of ramp cable . Since both ramp cables are connected to outboard ends of ramp ramp is selectively raised and lowered by this displacement by actuators . By wrapping multiple turns of each of ramp cables around their associated pairs of fixed and displaceable pulleys and the length of the displacements created by actuators can be magnified and or adjusted to correlate with extensions and retractions of an elongate skirt cable of bow skirt seal retraction system .

Skirt cable has a first end connected at the axis of one of displaceable pulleys of one of the pair of routing systems and its opposite second connected at the axis of the other displaceable pulley of the other of the pair of routing systems . In between the first and second ends and skirt cable is routed to longitudinally extend past load guiding pulleys secured to base portions and through a series of belt style attachment loops on the essentially forward outside surface of tubular shaped flexible bow seal . The series of attachment loops are preferably flexible but can be rigid to guide and retain skirt cable on forward outside surface of tubular shaped flexible bow seal . Loops extend in a laterally extending roughly line shaped strip that is located at a forward most location on outer surface on bow seal to position skirt cable and limit its motion along forward outside surface . This retention of skirt cable allows skirt cable to laterally slide through attachment loops in strip to respond to dynamic motions of flexible bow and coextensive seals and while vehicle is underway and to assure a controlled retraction and letting out of flexible bow seal .

Referring to the controlled retraction and letting out of flexible bow seal by skirt retraction system of the invention assures protection of bow seal from pinching and other debilitating damage between bow ramp and land surface when vehicle is off cushion during loading operations. Retraction of flexible bow seal is selectively initiated via skirt cable and both routing systems . Displaceable pulleys are simultaneously displaced toward fixed pulleys by actuators of both routing systems . This displacement pulls in lengths of skirt cable and the tightened skirt cable in strip causes a compression or folding in and retraction of flexible bow seal toward vehicle to its retracted position. Simultaneously during the drawing in of skirt cable and retraction of flexible bow seal the simultaneous displacement of displaceable pulleys toward fixed pulleys unwinds or extends ramp cables . The unwinding ramp cables lower bow ramp to the lowered position and place ramp landing pads on an exposed land surface . Since flexible bow seal is retracted placement of pads of bow ramp proceeds without damaging bow seal during subsequent loading operations.

Referring to bow skirt retraction system of the invention provides controlled letting out of flexible bow seal to allow vehicle to efficiently proceed underway after loading operations have been completed and volumes of pressurized air are being appropriately vented to recreate air cushion . Extension or letting out of flexible bow seal is selectively initiated via skirt cable and both routing systems . Displaceable pulleys are simultaneously displaced away from fixed pulleys by actuators of both routing systems . This displacement lets out lengths of skirt cable and the slackened skirt cable in strip allows flexible bow seal to inflate to its normal geometry at its extended position as vehicle delivers volumes of pressurized air to seals and for on cushion operation. Simultaneously during the letting out of skirt cable and flexible bow seal the simultaneous displacement of displaceable pulleys away from fixed pulleys winds or pulls in ramp cables . The wound in cables raise bow ramp to the raised position above and behind flexible bow seal to allow vehicle to proceed underway after inflation of air cushion .

Air cushion vehicle having the bow skirt retraction system in place with skirt cable extending across the outer forward surface of flexible bow seal can travel across water or land surfaces and can proceed with loading operations with reduced risk of damage to the skirt seal structures. The host air cushion vehicle for bow skirt seal retraction system of the invention can rely on many different means to raise and lower ramp and skirt cables and including but not limited to electric motors or hydraulic and or pneumatic pressure responsive mechanisms. Skirt retraction cable and the ramp cable are preferred to be mechanically coupled and operate dependently on each other for reliable operation. However the selected mechanisms need not have deployment of the ramp and skirt cables coordinated as specifically disclosed herein but may have a wide variety of actuation sequences and control devices and arrangements to retract and deploy differently configured variations of flexible bow seal and ramp to prevent damage to bow seal .

Having the teachings of this invention in mind bow skirt seal retraction system improves the efficiency of operation of an air cushion vehicle in terms of reliability and ease of operation. Bow skirt seal retraction system of the invention prevents pinching and undue Wear of the bow seal of an air cushion vehicle and eliminates unreliable internal arrangements of elastomeric members as presently designed that have proven unreliable for long term operation. The essentially protuberance free uncomplicated design does not interfere with operational dynamics and improves operation of vehicle . Bow skirt seal retraction system of the invention can be continuously monitored for real time repair if ever needed to allow this improvement to be maintained throughout the operational cycle of vehicle .

Modifications and alternate embodiments of bow skirt seal retraction system of the invention may be adapted and differently configured cables in the form of natural or man made straps or lines can be used for cables and mesh or net like slings can be across seal instead of a single cable and a wide variety of different mechanisms can be used as the constituents of routing systems to draw in or let out the cables. All components of system can be made from a wide variety of tough non corrosive or corrosion resistant materials that will hold up in the harsh marine environment. In addition to the uncomplicated highly functional systems described bow skirt seal retraction system of the invention could have different shapes sizes and materials to create hydrodynamically acceptable structures that accommodate different harsh operational conditions.

The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Bow skirt seal retraction system of the invention as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting but rather is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept. It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
