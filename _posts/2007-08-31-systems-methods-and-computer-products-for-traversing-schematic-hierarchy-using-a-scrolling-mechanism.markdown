The present invention relates generally to design development and manufacturing of integrated circuits ICs on semiconductor chips for use in automated computing systems. More particularly the present invention relates to an integrated circuit IC schematic layout debugging and editing scrolling method and tool.

When conducting hierarchical design and physical development of ICs circuit designers often face the problem of having voluminous smaller designs at various levels of the IC topological design hierarchy. When a layout designer needs to trace signal paths which traverse numerous design hierarchies within the same design window for various levels of the IC topological design hierarchy the designer user usually has to select a menu item and verify that they wish to descend i.e. scroll through one level in the hierarchy. Furthermore while attempting to debug the IC and or edit circuit schematics that traverse numerous design hierarchies within the same design window all the viewable hierarchical design levels distract and may confuse the circuit designer conducting the editing process involving only a few targeted hierarchical levels. Such electronic design automation tools fail to offer an easy interface to allow the user to traverse debug and edit schematics involving multiple levels of design hierarchies.

Therefore the need exists for a hierarchical design navigation method and a navigation apparatus for use in debugging layout induced electrical characteristics and layout to schematic verification LVS violations as well as editing and other schematic modifications that are typical for those of ordinary skill in the art.

An additional need exists for a convenient design hierarchy method and device which can save time and effort in viewing editing and modifying design elements.

Furthermore the need exists for a scroll mechanism to traverse through schematic hierarchical levels of design giving circuit designers users control over traversing a definable viewable scope at different levels of design hierarchy up and down quickly and smoothly which in turn will aid the debugging and editing processes.

A schematic hierarchy traversing scrolling and displaying method and apparatus are disclosed for displaying on a computer display device a viewable scope of an at least one hierarchical level of design from a plurality of hierarchical levels of design of a plurality of graphical hierarchical design applications including card design auto plane design computer aided design CAD and integrated circuit design. However the exemplary embodiment is not limited to any one design application or discipline. A user using an input device of a computer causes the computer to open a main debugging and editing screen. Using the input device the user causes the computer to assign a viewable scope of a block element desired for traversing in a first hierarchical level of design of a plurality of hierarchical levels of design in an integrated circuit under test by holding down a predefined keyboard key selecting the block element desired for traversing by causing a cursor to be positioned over the block element desired for traversing and highlighting the block element desired for traversing. Using the input device the user causes the computer to open the viewable scope of the block element desired for traversing by rolling the input device down. Using the input device the user causes the computer to descend and or scroll through at least one hierarchical level of design of the integrated circuit by scrolling through the block element desired for traversing in the main debugging and editing screen. Still using the input device the user causes the computer to close the viewable scope of the block element and reverse traverse to the first hierarchical level of design by causing the computer to position the cursor in an empty area of the schematic while holding down an other predefined keyboard key and rolling the input device up. The schematic hierarchy traversing scrolling and displaying method can be repeated for the plurality of hierarchical levels of design of the integrated circuit or the schematic hierarchy traversing scrolling and displaying method can be ended by the user when the user determines that the desired levels of hierarchical design have been traversed. Thus the user controls the input device causing the computer to perform a useful concrete and tangible result of traversing the viewable scope of the at least one hierarchical level of design and conducting a debugging and or an editing operation of the integrated circuit under test without distractions from voluminous levels of IC topological information of the plurality of hierarchical levels of design.

Also the direction of the scroll mouse movement could be defined in many different ways including scroll down to traverse by descending scroll up to traverse by ascending or scroll up to traverse by descending or scroll down to traverse by ascending. In the exemplary embodiment the cell A block element can be a clickable block element . When the user clicks on the cell A block element with the mouse scrolling device then rolls the mouse scrolling device down over the cell A block element program receives signals from keyboard and mouse scrolling device that when communicated to program executed by computer workstation processor program causes cell A block element to be selected and opened as part of the viewable scope of design of the hierarchical level of design L as illustrated as highlighted block element in schematic S. Element items A A and A are first second and third instances of the hierarchical level of design L included in the hierarchical cell A block element and are illustrated in Schematic S of .

At operation the user using keyboard and or mouse scrolling device communicatively interacts with program which enables the user to descend and or scroll through at least one hierarchical level of design of the integrated circuit by scrolling through the cell A block element items A A and A desired for traversing in the main debugging and editing screen into the at least one hierarchical level of design of the plurality of hierarchical levels of design P of the integrated circuit simulator and causes the computer workstation processor to perform the useful concrete and tangible results of traversing the viewable scope of the at least one hierarchical level of design and conducting a debugging and or an editing operations of the integrated circuit under test without distractions from voluminous levels of IC topological information of the plurality of hierarchical levels of design.

At operation using keyboard or mouse scrolling device the user communicatively interacts with program thereby causing the computer to close the viewable scope of the block element and reverse traverse to the first hierarchical level of design by causing the computer workstation processor to position the cursor in an empty area of the schematic S while holding down an other predefined key of keyboard and rolling the mouse scrolling device in an upward direction.
