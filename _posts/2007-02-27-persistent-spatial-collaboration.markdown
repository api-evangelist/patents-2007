title: Persistent spatial collaboration
abstract: Persistent, spatial collaboration on the web supports a free-form, user-intuitive approach to a variety of projects and activities. Users can place differing object types at any time any where on a web page and/or the system can automatically, and with no user effort, affect object placement based on one or more meta data characteristics. A user can, in real-time, see changes made by another user to a web page, and, if desired, react accordingly, enabling true collaboration even if the various users are at remote locations. The flexibility of the methodology and system provides a platform for users to engage in projects and activities in a manner and environment suited to the users' mind sets, creativity, and natural proclivities.

In our increasingly technologically based society people are communicating and collaborating with each other using their computers and computer based devices e.g. BLACKBERRY hand held devices computer based cell phones etc. collectively referred to herein as computing devices. And as people situated in remote locations from each other desire to work collaboratively there is increasingly an interest in effective and efficient mechanisms to use share create and view relevant information simultaneously and also asynchronously. Thus it would be advantageous to support computing device users by providing and supporting a persistent shared environment for the users to in an intuitive user friendly manner create share and collaborate on relevant information.

A wiki is a known type of website that allows users to share and edit content hosted on the website. Wikis however are primarily textual in nature. Moreover wikis are generally awkward to format. Additionally wikis are document based and thus rely on and are restricted to the flow of the document to organize and present user information.

There are also various photo oriented websites that allow users to share and in some cases collaborative on photo displays. However existing photo oriented websites are as their title suggests geared towards photo display and editing and thus have limited usages. Moreover known photo oriented websites use grid based layout schemes which do not allow for free form layout or easy customization.

There are a multitude of scenarios in which various computing device users could beneficially employ an easily accessible persistent collaborative format such as but not limited to working on development projects sharing thoughts on purchase choices e.g. home furniture or landscape options collaborating on scrapbook page designs designing a presentation writing and illustrating a story developing a map creating an electronic journal etc.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Embodiments discussed herein include technology that provides for persistent spatial based projects activities and or collaboration on one or more web pages hosted on the internet.

In an embodiment a persistent spatial collaboration system is implemented to allow one or more users to work and collaborate on a web page in a user intuitive free form style with no object characteristic boundaries.

In an aspect of an embodiment a user can access a web page and render one or more changes to the web page e.g. add an object modify an object etc. unhampered by any spatial boundaries affecting object placement based on the object type and or other object characteristics. In an aspect of an embodiment changes made to a web page by one user can be viewed by and reacted to in real time by other users currently accessing the same web page.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the invention. Any and all titles used throughout are for ease of explanation only and are not for use in limiting the invention.

An embodiment persistent spatial collaboration system depicted in uses a spatial layout metaphor for generating modifying sharing collaborating on and persisting a spatial based webpage among one or more computing device users. In an embodiment the persistent spatial collaboration system also referred to herein as a PSC system uses a two dimensional canvas or pasteboard or whiteboard metaphor to provide easy addition placement and arrangement of text images audio visual and audio collectively referred to as objects on one or more web pages. Computing device users also referred to herein simply as users can add or delete objects move scale orient modify and view objects on a web page. New web pages can be linked to existing web pages in the embodiment PSC system . In an embodiment automated actions e.g. placement deletion modification extraction etc. are performed on objects based on object characteristics and or properties.

The embodiment PSC system is compelling because it is a platform for a diverse number of user and user collaborative activities. In an embodiment the PSC system is not limited to a text flow based metaphor and thus supports any task that employs a spatial arrangement metaphor much in the way that users currently employ existing whiteboards.

As shown in in an embodiment information properties on objects added to a web page in the PSC system are stored as various characteristics in a database that is accessible by a web service application server . In an embodiment the web service application server supports a programmatic API application programming interface for enabling web page layout.

In the embodiment PSC system a web browser interacts with the web service application server and provides a user interface UI for a user to view add delete modify etc. objects on a web page supported by the PSC system . In an embodiment the web browser can receive one or more of a variety of input feeds including RSS i.e. a family of web feed formats used to publish updates to a website image queries user manual inputs database driven inputs etc. The utilization of a web browser for providing a UI for a user to view add delete modify etc. objects on a web page supported by the PSC system allows the user to work on such a web page without the need to make any additional installations e.g. program installs on their computing device.

In the embodiment PSC system the web browser and the web service application server communicate to generate and maintain the layout of a web page. In an aspect of this embodiment the web browser and the web service application server use a combination of XML and JAVASCRIPT to communicate information about the supported web page s . In an alternate aspect of this embodiment the web browser and the web service application server use a combination of JSON Javascript Object Notation and JAVASCRIPT to communicate information about the supported web page s . In still other alternative aspects of this embodiment the web browser and the web service application server employ other data transport protocols for communicating information about the supported web page s .

In an embodiment PSC system one or more other web browsers can communicate with the web service application server for enabling user shared viewing and collaboration on one or more various web pages.

In an embodiment a PSC system also supports a rich client hosted on a user computing device for generating modifying sharing collaborating on and persisting a spatial based web page among one or more computing device users. In an embodiment the rich client communicates with the web service application server to generate and maintain the layout of a web page. In an aspect of this embodiment the rich client and the web service application server communicate using a combination of XML and rich client supported applications languages to share information about the supported web page s . In other alternative aspects of this embodiment the rich client and the web service application server use other data transport protocols to enable sharing information about a supported web page s .

In an embodiment PSC system a supported rich client can communicate with one or more other rich clients hosted on the user s or other users computing devices for enabling shared viewing and collaboration on one or more various web pages. In an aspect of this embodiment peer to peer connections are established for the rich client and the one or more other rich clients to enable real time computing for the rich client and rich client s .

Referring to in an embodiment when a first user makes a change to a web page of a PSC system the first user s view of the web page is updated to reflect the change . In an embodiment the first user s computing device web browser passes information regarding the change to the web service application server . In an embodiment the web service application server in turn stores information regarding the change in a related database . In an embodiment when a second user is viewing and or collaborating on the same web page the second user s computing device web browser periodically polls the web service application server for any changes made to the web page since the second user accessed the web page or their web browser polled for changes to the web page . At decision block the web service application server makes a determination as to whether there has been a change made to the web page since the second user s view of the web page was generated or updated.

If there has been a change as shown in in an embodiment the web service application server retrieves the necessary information stored in the database for rendering the change and forwards the information to the web browser hosted by the second user s computing device . The second user s computing device web browser uses the forwarded information to generate the appropriate change to the second user s view of the same web page .

In an embodiment the second user can also make changes to the collaborative web page . Upon the second user making a change to the web page in an embodiment the second user s view of the web page is updated to reflect the change . In an embodiment the second user s computing device web browser passes information regarding the change to the web service application server . In an embodiment the web service application server in turn stores information regarding the change in a related database . The first user s computing device web browser periodically polls the web service application server for any changes made to the web page since the first user accessed the web page or their web browser last polled for changes to the web page .

Referring to at decision block the web service application server makes a determination as to whether there has been any change made to the web page since the first user s view of the web page was generated or last updated. If there has been a change in an embodiment the web service application server retrieves the necessary information stored in the database for rendering the change and forwards the information to the web browser hosted by the first user s computing device . The first user s computing device web browser uses the forwarded information to generate the appropriate change to the first user s view of the same web page .

At decision block a determination is made as to whether the first user has made a change to the web page. If yes as shown in the first user s view of the web page is updated to reflect the change and the first user s computing device web browser passes information regarding the change to the web service application server which in turn stores information regarding the change in a related database .

If at decision block a determination is made that the first user has not made a change to the web page then at decision block a determination is made as to whether the second user has made a change to the web page. If yes as shown in the second user s view of the web page is updated to reflect the change and the second user s computing device web browser passes information regarding the change to the web service application server which in turn stores information regarding the change in a related database .

The simplified flow of this process continues with each user capable of making changes to the collaborative web page and each user s web browser periodically polling the web service application server to determine if a change has been rendered to the collaborative web page.

Thus for example and referring to assume a first user A is working on a spatial web page supported by a PSC system via their computing device . Also assume user A has placed or otherwise positioned an image i.e. picture on the web page at a first position . If a second user B accesses or otherwise loads the web page via the web browser hosted by their computing device user B will see the picture as placed on the web page by user A in position .

Now assume that user A moves the picture from its original first position to a second position on the web page . In an embodiment user B sees the picture move on the web page on user B s computing device display from its first position to its second position .

In an embodiment the PSC system provides for this real time property sharing of objects hosted on the exemplary web page between user A and user B by having the web browser hosted by user B s computing device poll the web service application server periodically to retrieve any changes made to the web page since its view was last generated or updated on user B s computing device display.

In an embodiment to support real time viewing and web page collaboration only changes to a currently shared web page are propagated via the polling technique discussed with reference to to user s simultaneously collaborating i.e. viewing and or working on the web page. In this manner the entire web page need not be refreshed on each collaborating user s computing device display every time a change to the web page is generated by any one collaborating user.

In an embodiment there can be one user accessing i.e. viewing and or editing a web page supported by the PSC system two users simultaneously accessing a collaborative web page supported by the PSC system as exemplified in the processing flow of or more than two users simultaneously accessing a collaborative web page. If there are two or more users simultaneously accessing a collaborative web page in an embodiment each user s computing device web browser periodically polls the web service application server to determine if a change has been rendered to the web page since the respective user s view of the web page was generated or last updated.

In an embodiment if a user s computing device is using a rich client to collaborate i.e. view and or work on a web page supported by a PSC system the rich client also uses the polling technique discussed with reference to to access any changes made to the web page since it was last updated on the user s computing device display. Thus referring again to in this embodiment when a first user makes a change to a web page of a PSC system the rich client processing on the user s computing device passes information regarding the change to the web service application server . In an embodiment the web service application server in turn stores information regarding the change in a related database . In an embodiment when a second user is simultaneously collaborating on the same web page the rich client processing on the second user s computing device periodically polls the web service application server for any changes made to the web page since the second user accessed the web page or the rich client processing on the second user s computing device polled for changes to the web page . At decision block a determination is made as to whether a change has been made to the web page since the second user s view of the web page was generated or updated.

If there has been such a change in an embodiment the web service application server retrieves the necessary information stored in the database for generating the changes and forwards the information to the rich client processing on the second user s computing device . The rich client processing on the second user s computing device uses the forwarded information to render appropriate changes to the second user s view of the same web page .

In an embodiment a second user s computing device can also use a rich client to collaborate i.e. view and or work on the same web page. In an embodiment the second user can also make changes to the collaborative web page as indicated in . Upon the second user making a change to the web page in an embodiment the rich client processing on the second user s computing device passes information regarding the change to the web service application server which in turn stores information regarding the change in a related database . The rich client processing on the first user s computing device periodically polls the web service application server for any changes made to the web page since the first user accessed the web page or the rich client processing on their computing device last polled for changes to the web page .

In this embodiment and as shown in at decision block the web service application server makes a determination as to whether there has been any change made to the web page since the first user s view of the web page was generated or last updated. If there has been a change in an embodiment the web service application server retrieves the necessary information stored in the database for rendering the change and forwards the information to the rich client processing on the first user s computing device . The rich client processing on the first user s computing device uses the forwarded information to generate the appropriate change to the first user s view of the same web page .

At decision block a determination is made as to whether the first user has made a change to the web page. If yes in this embodiment and as shown in the rich client processing on the first user s computing device passes information regarding the change to the web service application server which in turn stores information regarding the change in a related database .

If at decision block a determination is made that the first user has not made a change to the web page then at decision block a determination is made as to whether the second user has made a change to the web page. If yes in this embodiment and as shown in the rich client processing on the second user s computing device passes information regarding the change to the web service application server which in turn stores information regarding the change in a related database .

The simplified flow of this process continues with each user capable of making changes to the collaborative web page and the rich client processing on each user s computing device periodically polling the web service application server to determine if a change has been rendered to the collaborative web page.

In an alternative embodiment if two or more users computing devices are running rich clients to access a collaborative web page supported by an embodiment PSC system changes made by one user can be pushed to the computing devices of the other users. For example assume user A and user B of are both accessing the same collaborative web page via rich clients processing on their respective computing devices and . Also assume that user A moves the picture from its first position to a second position . In this alternative embodiment the rich client processing on user A s computing device sends the necessary change information to the rich client processing on user B s computing device negating the need for the rich client operating on the computing device to poll a web service application server for any changes made since the view displayed on computing device was last generated or updated. The rich client processing on user B s computing device uses the change information it receives from the rich client processing on user A s computing device to render the necessary change and view for user B i.e. in the example of the rich client processing on user B s computing device uses the positional change information of picture to display on user B s computing device picture in new location .

In an embodiment a user accessing a collaborative web page supported by an embodiment PSC system can also and or additionally refresh the web page or perform some action that causes the web page to be refreshed. In this embodiment the entire web page is redrawn on the respective user s computing device display and the redrawn web page includes any changes made to the web page since the web page view was last updated on the user s computing device display.

As noted above an embodiment PSC system uses a two dimensional canvas or pasteboard or whiteboard metaphor to provide easy addition placement and arrangement of objects on one or more web pages. An embodiment PSC system is not limited to the traditional document flow generally used in currently known systems. Thus for example and referring to a user can position a new picture anywhere on the exemplary web page . The user can also add any other object e.g. picture text audio audio visual anywhere on the web page .

For example a user can click on position on the web page to create a text box . The user can then begin to type text into the text box . In an embodiment the original created text box is a predetermined width with its length increasing as necessary to accommodate the user s input text. In an embodiment the user can at any time after the text box is first created reformat the size width and or length of the text box . The user can also at any time after the text box is first created reposition it on the web page e.g. from its initial start position to a new start position .

In an embodiment other users with the proper authority can reposition modify add delete etc. objects on a collaborative web page. In an embodiment however a second user cannot reposition modify or delete a text box that a first user is currently working in. Thus for example and referring to in an embodiment if a first user is currently inputting text to text box no other user with any access to the collaborative web page can reposition modify or delete text box at this time. However once the first user is finished inputting and or modifying text in text box and is no longer working in text box the text box becomes available to other users with the proper authority for modification repositioning or even deleting.

Likewise in an embodiment a second user cannot reposition modify or delete any other object type e.g. picture audio audio visual that a first user is currently working on a collaborative web page. In this embodiment again however once the first user is finished working on the object the object then becomes available to other users with the proper authority for modification repositioning or deleting.

In an embodiment more than one user can add modify reposition or delete alternative objects simultaneously on a collaborative web page. Thus for example a first user can be inputting text to text box while a second user adds text box to the same web page and is inputting text to text box . As another example a first user can be inputting text to text box while a second user is simultaneously moving picture from its original first position to a second position on the web page .

In an embodiment there is no limit to the number of users that can simultaneously collaborate on a web page supported by an embodiment PSC system . In an alternative embodiment a predetermined number of users can simultaneously collaborate on a web page supported by an embodiment PSC system .

In an embodiment the objects added to a web page supported by an embodiment PSC system can be assigned or otherwise designated various access levels. depicts an embodiment of various access levels that can be assigned any one object on such a collaborative web page. A view only access level assigned an object on a collaborative web page ensures that the object can only be viewed by users other than the user that added the object to the web page. All users other than the user that added an object with a view only access level cannot modify reposition delete or in any other manner affect the object on the web page. The user that originally added the object to the web page however can modify reposition or delete an object with a view only access level .

A hidden access level assigned to an object on a collaborative web page causes the object to be hidden i.e. not displayed to any user of the collaborative web page other than the user that added the object to the web page. In an embodiment if a second user tries to add or reposition a second object that will hide or partially hide an object with an assigned hidden access level the second user will get an error code and be denied the ability to add or reposition the second object as attempted. In an alternative embodiment if a second user attempts to add or reposition a second object that will hide or partially hide an object with an assigned hidden access level the action is allowed and performed. In an aspect of this alternative embodiment if the second object totally obscures the object with the assigned hidden access level the view displayed to the user who added the object with the hidden access level to the web page will see the object with the hidden access level on their computing device display behind a shadow of the second object that has been positioned over it.

A modify only access level assigned to an object on a collaborative web page allows all users with the proper authority to view and modify the object. In an embodiment an object with a modify only access level cannot be repositioned or deleted by any other user but the user that originally added the object to the web page.

A reposition only access level assigned to an object on a collaborative web page allows all users with the proper authority to view and reposition the object on the web page. In an embodiment an object with a reposition only access level cannot be otherwise modified or deleted by any other user but the user that originally added the object to the web page.

A delete only access level assigned to an object on a collaborative web page allows all users with the proper authority to view the object and delete the object from the web page. In an embodiment an object with a delete only access level cannot be modified or repositioned by any other user but the user that originally added the object to the web page.

A full collaboration access level assigned to an object on a collaborative web page allows all users with the proper authority to view modify reposition delete or in any other manner affect the object on the web page.

In an embodiment there are various limited collaboration access levels that can be assigned to an object on a collaborative web page. For example in an embodiment one limited collaboration access level assigned to an object allows all users with the proper authority to view modify and reposition the object on the web page. In this embodiment limited collaboration access level such an assigned object cannot be deleted by any user but the user that originally added the object to the web page. In an embodiment a second limited collaboration access level assigned to an object allows all users with the proper authority to view modify and delete the object on the web page. In this second embodiment limited collaboration access level such an assigned object cannot be repositioned by anyone other than the user that originally added the object to the web page. In an embodiment a third limited collaboration access level assigned to an object allows all users with the proper authority to view reposition and delete the object on the web page. In this third embodiment limited collaboration access level such an assigned object cannot be otherwise modified by anyone other than the user that originally added the object to the web page.

In alternative embodiments various subsets of the access levels can be assigned to objects added to a collaborative web page. In other alternative embodiments additional and or different access levels can be assigned to objects added to a collaborative web page.

In an embodiment the default access level assigned to objects added to a collaborative web page is the full collaboration access level . In an embodiment the user who adds an object to a collaborative web page can assign an access level to the object that is different than the default access level assigned objects by the embodiment PSC system .

In an embodiment users with access to an embodiment PSC system are assigned or otherwise designated various authority levels. In one embodiment a user is assigned one authority level for all collaborative web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system . In another embodiment a user is assigned a unique authority level for each collaborative web page supported by an embodiment PSC system .

In an embodiment the creator of a web page designates the authority levels assigned to the other users with access to the PSC system supporting the web page. In an alternative embodiment a system administrator designates authority levels assigned to users for each web page supported by a PSC system . In an aspect of this alternative embodiment a user who generates a web page in a PSC system can override the system administrator authority designation for any particular user and assign a new authority level to the user.

A view authority level assigned a user for one or more web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system means that the user can only view the one or more web pages. A user with a view authority level cannot add modify reposition delete or in any other manner alter any object on any of the one or more web pages to which the user has such an assigned view authority level .

In an embodiment a limited collaboration authority level assigned a user for one or more web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system means that the user can only view and add objects to the one or more web pages. In this embodiment a user with an assigned limited collaboration authority level for a web page cannot modify reposition or delete objects added to the web page by any other user of the web page. In an aspect of this embodiment a user with an assigned limited collaboration authority level can modify reposition and delete objects that the user has added to the web page.

In a second embodiment a limited collaboration authority level assigned a user for one or more web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system means that the user can view add and modify objects on the one or more web pages. In this second embodiment a user with an assigned limited collaboration authority level for a web page cannot reposition or delete objects added to the web page by any other user of the web page. In an aspect of this second embodiment a user with an assigned limited collaboration authority level can modify reposition and delete objects that the user has added to the web page.

In a third embodiment a limited collaboration authority level assigned a user for one or more web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system means that the user can view add modify and reposition objects on the one or more web pages. In this third embodiment a user with an assigned limited collaboration authority level for a web page cannot delete objects added to the web page by any other user of the web page. In an aspect of this third embodiment a user with an assigned limited collaboration authority level can modify reposition and delete objects that the user has added to the web page.

In other embodiments a limited collaboration authority level assigned a user for one or more web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system means the user can perform various combinations of actions on objects on the one or more web pages although the user cannot perform all actions on the objects. For example in one such alternative embodiment a user assigned a limited collaboration authority level for one or more web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system can view add modify and delete objects on the one or more web pages but the user cannot reposition any objects added by any other user on the one or more web pages. In an aspect of this alternative embodiment a user can modify reposition and delete objects that the user has added to the web page.

A full collaboration authority level assigned a user for one or more web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system means the user has complete access to all objects on the one or more web pages. Thus a user with an assigned full collaboration authority level can view add modify reposition and delete any object on the one or more web pages whether or not the user or any other user originally added the object to the respective web page.

In an embodiment a full collaboration authority with exceptions level assigned a user for one or more web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system means the user has complete access to all objects on the one or more web pages except for objects in one or more designated regions or areas on the one or more web pages. For example and referring to in this embodiment assigning a user full collaboration authority with exceptions level for exemplary web page can dictate that the user can view add modify reposition and delete any objects in a first region of the web page but the user can only view objects positioned in a second region of the same web page .

As another example in this embodiment assigning a user full collaboration authority with exceptions level for exemplary web page can dictate that the user can view add modify reposition and delete any objects in a first region of the web page but the user can only view objects positioned in a second region or a third region of the same web page .

In an alternative aspect of this embodiment a user assigned a full collaboration authority with exceptions level for a particular web page has no authority to even view objects positioned in one or more designated areas on the web page. Thus for example and again referring to in this alternative aspect of this embodiment assigning a user full collaboration authority with exceptions level for exemplary web page can dictate that the user can view add modify reposition and delete objects in a first region of the web page but the user cannot even view let alone add modify reposition or delete objects positioned in a second region of the same web page .

In other alternative aspects of this embodiment a user assigned a full collaboration authority with exceptions level for a particular web page has full access to objects positioned in one or more regions of the one or more web pages and limited access to objects positioned in one or more other regions of the one or more web pages. For example in one such other alternative aspect of this embodiment assigning a user full collaboration authority with exceptions level for exemplary web page can dictate that the user can view add modify reposition and delete objects in a first region of the web page but the user can only view and add objects in a second region or a third region of the same web page . As another example in this alternative aspect of this embodiment assigning a user full collaboration authority with exceptions level for exemplary web page can dictate that the user can view add modify reposition and delete objects in a first region of the web page but the user can only view add and reposition objects in a second region and can only view objects in a third region of the same web page .

In still other alternative embodiments various subsets of the authority levels can be assigned to users for web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system . In yet other alternative embodiments additional and or different authority levels can be assigned to users for web pages supported by an embodiment PSC system .

In an embodiment an object s access level supersedes a user s authority level . Thus for example and referring to assume a user A who has added picture to the web page has assigned the picture object an access level of view only access . Further assume a second user C has full collaboration authority for the web page . In this embodiment even though user C has full collaboration authority for web page meaning that user C can in general add modify reposition and delete objects on web page user C is limited to only viewing picture object . This is because in this embodiment the picture object s view only access level supersedes user C s full collaboration authority for the web page hosting the picture object .

In an embodiment new web pages can be added to a PSC system and linked to a current web page supported by the PSC system . In an embodiment a link from a first web page to one or more other web pages of a PSC system can be assigned or otherwise associated with any object on the first web page any annotation of any object on the first web page and or one or more positions established for linkage on the first web page e.g. position on web page of can be established by a user as a link to one or more other web pages.

In an embodiment PSC system filtering is available for a user to define which objects on a respective web page are to be exhibited in the user s view of the web page. For example a user can filter or otherwise hide from their current view of a web page objects created or otherwise added to the web page before a certain date objects created or otherwise added to the web page by one or more identified users objects positioned in a particular x y coordinate region on the web page objects that have one or more identified properties e.g. are picture objects are text objects are of a certain size etc. As another example a user can filter or otherwise only show in their current view of a web pages objects created or otherwise added to the web page after a certain date objects created or otherwise added to the web page by one or more identified users objects positioned in a particular x y coordinate region on the web page objects that have one or more identified properties e.g. are picture objects are text objects are of a certain size etc.

In an embodiment one user s filtering of objects on a collaborative web page does not affect any other user s simultaneous view of the same web page. Thus for example a user A s filtering of all objects created or otherwise added to a web page before a certain date in effect hiding these objects from user A s view of the web page does not affect a user B s simultaneous view of the same web page which in user B s view continues to show the objects filtered by user A.

In an embodiment PSC system zooming in and out on a web page is available to a user who wants to look at just one x y coordinate region of a web page or who alternatively wants to zoom out from just one x y coordinate region of a web page to the full web page view. In an embodiment one user s action of zooming in or out on a collaborative web page does not affect any other user s simultaneous view of the same web page. Thus for example if a user A zooms in on region of web page in in effect only viewing region of the web page on their computing device display this action will not affect a user B s simultaneous view of the same web page . In this example user B will continue to view the entire web page on their respective computing device display at the same time that user A is viewing only region of the same web page .

In an embodiment PSC system users can sort objects on one or more web pages. For example in this embodiment one user can sort objects of a particular web page based on the time each object was generated or otherwise added to the web page while another user can sort objects of the same web page based on one or more object metadata characteristics e.g. object size object position on the web page and or object type etc.

An embodiment PSC system has an option i.e. an age option that causes objects on one or more web pages supported by the PSC system to visually age based on each object s meta data. In an aspect of this embodiment the age option when employed fades objects that have been created or otherwise added to the web page before an established date and or time i.e. aged objects. In another aspect of this embodiment the age option when employed yellows i.e. tints objects yellow in the various users views of the web page which were created or otherwise added to the web page before an established date and or time i.e. aged objects. In yet other alternative aspects of this embodiment the age option when employed affects the view of objects with predefined meta data in various other manners e.g. tints identified aged objects other colors e.g. blue green etc. resizes aged objects to a predefined minimized size relocates aged objects to a predefined region on the web page etc.

In an embodiment a system administrator of an embodiment PSC system can activate the age option. In an embodiment the user who originally created or otherwise started a web page in an embodiment PSC system can activate the age option. In an embodiment any user with full collaboration authority for a web page in an embodiment PSC system can activate the age option for objects of the respective web page. In other embodiments other users and or combinations of users and or the system administrator of an embodiment PSC system can activate the age option for a web page.

In an alternative embodiment the age option is a default option that can be overrode i.e. turned off or otherwise disabled by either the system administrator of an embodiment PSC system the user who originally created or otherwise started the web page any user with full collaboration authority for the web page or other users or combinations of users and or the system administrator of an embodiment PSC system .

In an embodiment once the age option is enabled for a web page all users views of the web page are affected by the age option. In an alternative embodiment if one user with the proper authority enables the age option for a web page only that user s view of the web page is affected by the age option operation. In this alternative embodiment all other users views of the same web page are unaffected by and therefore do not reflect the enabling of the age option.

An embodiment PSC system supports web page versioning in which various versions of a single web page can be maintained accessed and worked on at any one time.

An embodiment PSC system provides undo redo support for additions modifications and deletions performed on a respective web page.

An embodiment PSC system provides the capability for time history playback of editing performed on a respective web page. In this embodiment one or more users have access to i.e. can view or otherwise playback a time history of the editing i.e. additions modifications and deletion of objects performed on a particular web page. In an aspect of this embodiment a system administrator for the PSC system has access to the time history of the editing performed on all web pages supported by the PSC system . In an aspect of this embodiment only users with one or more particular authority levels for the respective web page e.g. only users with full collaboration authority or only users with limited collaboration authority or full collaboration authority can access the time history of the editing performed on the web page. In an alternative aspect of this embodiment any user can access the time history of the editing performed on the web pages supported by a PSC system .

In an embodiment templates are employed as an aid to controlling the editing and or presentation of objects on web pages supported by a PSC system . In an aspect of this embodiment templates are created for and hosted by an embodiment PSC system for use by users of web pages supported by the PSC system . In another aspect of this embodiment users can also create templates for assistance in controlling the editing and or presentation of objects on one or more web pages supported by a PSC system . In this aspect of this embodiment user created templates can be shared among one or more users of the one or more web pages supported by the PSC system .

In an embodiment only users with one or more particular authority levels for a respective web page e.g. only users with full collaboration authority or only users with limited collaboration authority or full collaboration authority can author templates for aid in controlling the editing and or presentation of objects on the web page. In an alternative embodiment any user can author a template for assistance in controlling the editing and or presentation of objects on a web page.

In an embodiment only users with one or more particular authority levels for a respective web page can access the templates generated for assistance in controlling the editing and or presentation of objects on the web page. In an alternative embodiment only users with one or more particular authority levels for a respective web page can access user created templates generated for assistance in controlling the editing and or presentation of objects on the web page. In this alternative embodiment these same users with one or more particular authority levels for a respective web page can access the templates created for and hosted by the PSC system for web pages supported by the PSC system . In a second alternative embodiment any user can access any template associated or otherwise useable with any web page supported by the PSC system . In this second alternative embodiment however access to a template does not supersede a user s web page authority level or any object s access level.

In an embodiment temporal i.e. time sensitive templates are created for and hosted by an embodiment PSC system . In an aspect of this embodiment one or more users can also generate temporal templates for assistance with editing and or presenting objects on one or more web pages supported by a PSC system .

In an embodiment PSC system slide shows can be created for one or more web pages. In an embodiment a slide show for a web page in a PSC system can be temporal i.e. time sensitive in nature. In an embodiment a slide show for a web page in a PSC system can be determined by one or more metadata characteristics of the objects on the respective web page e.g. object size object position on the web page and or object type etc.

In an embodiment various users can each simultaneously access different views of the same web page supported by a PSC system . For example one user can request or otherwise define a first layout for the objects of a web page that are presented in a first view to this user while simultaneously a second user can request or otherwise define a second layout for the objects of the same web page that are simultaneously presented in a second view to this second user. As another example a first user can request a first sort order for objects of a web page while a second user can simultaneously request a second sort order for the objects of the same web page. With this embodiment among other benefits two or more users can collaborate simultaneously on the same web page each viewing the objects of the web page in a manner most pertinent to or otherwise understandable meaningful or even aesthetically pleasing to each user.

In addition to manual user driven layout of web page objects an embodiment PSC system supports automatic programmatic layout of web page objects. In this embodiment temporal considerations e.g. when an object was added to the web page when a web page object was last edited etc. sort orders object metadata and or object type etc. can be used by a program to automatically layout objects on a respective web page. With this embodiment a large number of objects can be quickly and easily rearranged on a web page based on user identified criteria.

An embodiment PSC system supports entity identification and extraction in which one or more web pages are automatically examined for the presence of pre identified entities which if they exist on the searched web page s are tagged and or copied to another location e.g. another web page a predefined database location etc. In this embodiment an entity can be anything of any object type. Examples of entities include but are not limited to phone numbers emails addresses specifications for e.g. products architectural designs etc. black and white photographic pictures audio files containing pre identified melodies audio visual files containing pre identified images and or sound bites etc. Among other benefits entity identification and extraction enables the generation of rich metadata for describing one or more web pages.

An embodiment PSC system supports automatic web page generation and web page view generation of pre existing entities located on one or more existing web pages. For example in this embodiment a web page can be automatically generated by the PSC system or a view of an existing web page can be automatically created by the PSC system containing pre identified entities located on one or more existing web pages. Examples of such pre identified entities include but are not limited to phone numbers emails addresses specifications for e.g. products architectural designs etc. black and white photographic pictures audio files containing pre identified melodies audio visual files containing pre identified images and or sound bites etc. Among other benefits automatic web page generation and web page view generation allows for quick and user effortless access to a collection of entities that are otherwise spread out across various web pages supported by the embodiment PSC system .

Referring to at decision block a determination is made as to whether a user is attempting to work on and or view a PSC system supported web page. If yes at decision block a determination is made as to whether the web page currently exists. If no a web page is created and made accessible to the user . If however at decision block it is determined that the web page the user is attempting to work on and or view exists at decision block a determination is made as to whether the user has a proper authority level for accessing the web page. If yes the web page is made accessible to the user . If no the user is denied access to the web page .

At decision block a determination is made as to whether a user is trying to add a picture object to a web page they currently have access to.

Referring to the added text box object is displayed in the user s view of the web page . At decision block a determination is made as to whether the user who added the text box object to the web page is attempting to change the size and or shape of the text box object. If yes the text box size and or shape is altered based on the user s input .

After a text box object is added to a web page the text is displayed in other current users views of the web page i.e. in the views of the other users currently accessing the web page if the text box object access level allows for this e.g. the text box object access level is not hidden access .

At decision block a determination is made as to whether based on predetermined criteria an automatic link is to be established from the newly added text box object to a second web page. If yes the proper link between the text box object and the second web page is established .

If no automatic link is to be established at decision block a determination is made as to whether the user who added the text box object to the web page is attempting to create a link from the text box object to a second web page. If yes the user requested link between the text box object and the second web page is established .

Referring to at decision block a determination is made as to whether a user is trying to add another object type e.g. an audio visual file or an audio file to a web page they currently have access to. If yes at decision block a determination is made as to whether the user has a proper authority level for adding the object to the web page. If no the user is not allowed to add the object to the web page . If however the user has a proper authority level for adding the new object to the web page at decision block a determination is made as to whether automatic placement is currently enabled i.e. whether or not the system is enabled to automatically position the object type based on one or more object meta data characteristics.

If automatic placement is currently enabled the object the user wishes to add to the web page is automatically positioned on the web page based on one or more meta data characteristics of the object and is displayed or otherwise indicated in the user s web page view . If however automatic placement is not currently enabled the object the user wishes to add to the web page is positioned on the web page as directed by the user and is displayed or otherwise indicated in the user s web page view . In either case the newly added object is then displayed or otherwise indicated in other current users views of the web page i.e. in the views of the other users currently accessing the web page if the object access level allows for this e.g. the object access level is not hidden access .

At decision block a determination is made as to whether based on predetermined criteria an automatic link is to be established from the newly added object to a second web page. If yes the proper link between the object and the second web page is established .

If no automatic link is to be established at decision block a determination is made as to whether the user who added the object to the web page is attempting to create a link from the object to a second web page. If yes the user requested link between the object and the second web page is established .

Referring to at decision block a determination is made as to whether a user wishes to change their view of the web page currently being accessed e.g. zoom filter etc. If yes the view for that user is changed accordingly on their respective computing device display .

At decision block a determination is made as to whether a user is attempting to modify delete reposition or in any other manner alter a currently existing object on the web page. If yes at decision block a determination is made as to whether the user has a proper authority level for the attempted action. If no the user is not allowed to modify delete reposition or otherwise alter the object on the web page . If however the user has a proper authority level for the action attempted on the web page object at decision block a determination is made as to whether the object access level allows the user to perform the desired action on the object. If no the user is not allowed to modify delete reposition or otherwise alter the object on the web page .

If however the object access level allows for the user to modify delete reposition or otherwise alter the web page object the object is modified deleted repositioned or otherwise altered per the user input . The change is then reflected in the user s view of the web page . The change is also reflected in other current users views of the web page i.e. in the views of the other users currently accessing the web page if the respective object access level allows for this e.g. the object access level is was not hidden access .

Referring to at decision block a determination is made as to whether a user has requested a time history playback of the web page. If yes the user is provided access to view a time history of the editing e.g. additions modifications etc. of the web page .

At decision block a determination is made as to whether a user has requested to enable an aging option for the web page. If yes the user s view of the web page is altered to reflect the age of the web page objects . In an embodiment the web page views of one or more other current users i.e. other users currently accessing the web page are also correspondingly altered to reflect the age of the web page objects .

At decision block a determination is made as to whether entity identification and extraction has been enabled. If yes one or more web pages are examined for predefined entities which if located are then tagged and or copied to another location e.g. a new web page a database location etc.
