title: Computerized medical self-diagnostic and treatment advice system
abstract: A system and method for providing computerized, knowledge-based medical diagnostic and treatment advice. The medical advice is provided to the general public over a telephone network. Two new authoring languages, interactive voice response and speech recognition are used to enable expert and general practitioner knowledge to be encoded for access by the public. “Meta” functions for time-density analysis of a number of factors regarding the number of medical complaints per unit of time are an integral part of the system. A semantic discrepancy evaluator routine along with a mental status examination are used to detect the consciousness level of a user of the system. A re-enter feature monitors the user's changing condition over time. A symptom severity analysis helps to respond to the changing conditions. System sensitivity factors may be changed at a global level or other levels to adjust the system advice as necessary.

No. 08 176 041 filed Dec. 29 1993 now U.S. Pat. No. 5 660 176. The above referenced applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to medical knowledge systems and more particularly to systems for giving medical advice to the general public over a telephone network.

Health care costs currently represent 14 of the United States Gross National Product and are rising faster than any other component of the Consumer Price Index. Moreover usually because of an inability to pay for medical services many people are deprived of access to even the most basic medical care and information.

Many people delay in obtaining or are prevented from seeking medical attention because of cost time constraints or inconvenience. If the public had universal unrestricted and easy access to medical information many diseases could be prevented. Likewise the early detection and treatment of numerous diseases could keep many patients from reaching the advanced stages of illness the treatment of which is a significant part of the financial burden attributed to our nation s health care system. It is obvious that the United States is facing health related issues of enormous proportions and that present solutions are not robust.

One prior attempt at a solution to the health care problem is called Ask A Nurse wherein a group of nurses provide health information by telephone around the clock. A person with a medical problem calls an 800 number and describes the problem to the nurse. The nurse uses a computer for general or diagnostic information on the ailment or complaint mentioned by the caller. The nurse may then refer the caller to a doctor from a computerized referral list for a contracting hospital or group of hospitals. Client hospitals contract with Ask A Nurse to provide patient referrals. A managed care option called Personal Health Advisor is similar and adds the capability for the caller to hear prerecorded messages on health topics 24 hours a day. Several problems exist with these prior medical advice systems. First these systems have high costs associated with having a nurse answer each telephone call. Second the caller may have to belong to a participating health plan to utilize the service. Third if for some reason all nurses on a particular shift happen to be busy and the caller has an emergency condition that is not known by the caller to be an emergency precious time in getting emergency services may be lost during the delay.

Another prior health system was developed by InterPractice Systems which provides a computerized service that answers health care questions and advises people in their homes. A health maintenance organization HMO may provide this service to its members in a particular geographic area. To get advice at home an HMO member connects a toaster sized box to a telephone and calls a toll free 800 number. Using a keyboard that is part of the box the user answers questions displayed on a screen of the box relating to the user s symptoms. Depending on the answers the user might be told to try a home remedy be called by a nurse or doctor or be given an appointment to be examined. A limitation of this system is the additional expense of the electronics box which could either be purchased by the user for approximately 300 or purchased by the health organization with the expense to be passed on to the users. Another limitation is that this service is directed to members of a particular contracting health organization such as an HMO. What is desired is a system that does not require additional hardware for the basic service but that utilizes the existing communication network. The desired system should be available for use by any person not just members of a certain organization.

A prior attempt at a health care solution for a limited set of conditions is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 712 562. A patient s blood pressure and heart rate are measured and the measurements are sent via telephone to a remote central computer for storage and analysis. Reports are generated for submission to a physician or the patient. U.S. Pat. No. 4 531 527 describes a similar system wherein the receiving office unit automatically communicates with the physician under predetermined emergency circumstances.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 838 275 discloses a device for a patient to lay on or sit in having electronics to measure multiple parameters related to a patient s health. These parameters are electronically transmitted to a central surveillance and control office where a highly trained observer interacts with the patient. The observer conducts routine diagnostic sessions except when an emergency is noted or from a patient initiated communication. The observer determines if a nonroutine therapeutic response is required and if so facilitates such a response. As previously mentioned highly trained people are needed by this system along with the special measurement apparatus embedded in a bed or chair .

Other prior attempts at a health care solution are typified by U.S. Pat. No. 5 012 411 which describes a portable self contained apparatus for measuring storing and transmitting detected physiological information to a remote location over a communication system. The information is evaluated by a physician or other health professional. As before highly trained people are necessary to utilize such an apparatus.

Several services to provide medical or pharmaceutical advice are now available via 1 900 telephone numbers e.g. Doctors by Phone. These services are available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. A group of doctors including some specialties is available to answer questions about health care or medical conditions for people anywhere in the United States who call the 1 900 telephone of one of the services. A group of registered pharmacists answers questions about medications for the 1 900 pharmaceutical service.

The present solution to the health care problem is a computerized medical diagnostic and treatment advice MDATA system that is a medical knowledge based system designed to give medical advice to the general public over the telephone network. The goal of the MDATA system is to provide everyone with equal access to high quality 100 consistent medical advice at a reasonable cost. The MDATA system provides callers with extremely fast and virtually unlimited access to health care information twenty four hours a day from any location around the world. Health care advice is made available to an entire spectrum of users from elderly patients confined to their homes to travelers in a foreign country with telephones in their cars.

The central ideas leading to the development of the MDATA system are based on the following assumptions 

A goal of the MDATA system is to give better medical advice than a family practitioner who is unfamiliar with a patient e.g. an on call physician. A person seeking medical advice frequently will not be able to see or speak with his or her personal physician in a timely manner. The MDATA system provides medical advice whenever desired by the caller seven days a week 24 hours a day.

All previous medical algorithms including those used in the military are designed for face to face interactions. Self help books generally do not consider age and sex in their algorithms. Furthermore a book cannot take into account how many times a person has consulted the same algorithm within a short period of time for the same problem. The medical algorithms used by the MDATA system are designed for use in a telecommunications setting and overcome the deficiencies of self help books.

Previous medical advice systems do not do a time density analysis for a number of factors with regard to the number of complaints per unit of time. The MDATA system uses meta functions to perform these analyses.

Previous medical advice algorithms do not have a way of detecting the consciousness level of the person seeking consultation. The MDATA system invokes a mental status examination whenever a complaint or problem has the possibility of an altered level of consciousness. In addition the MDATA system uses semantic discrepancy evaluator loops which allow the system to invoke the mental status exam if there are differences in answers to the parallel threads of thought that are woven or embedded into the system.

Other medical advice systems do not have a re enter feature to monitor a patient s progress or worsening over time. The MDATA system checks for and responds to changing conditions over time.

Prior medical advice systems suffer from the inability to be nearly instantly up dated as new medical information is made available. The MDATA system regularly and frequently updates the treatment aspect of the system.

The computerized medical diagnostic and treatment advice MDATA system is a medical knowledge based system designed to give medical advice to the general public over the telephone network. Using a new authoring language interactive voice response and speech recognition technology the MDATA system encodes a highly useful core of expert and general practitioner diagnostic and treatment knowledge into a computerized system for access by non medically trained personnel.

The MDATA system does not provide advice for every medical problem nor does it make an exhaustive study of one vertical cross section of medicine. Instead the MDATA system provides up to date medical advice for approximately one hundred of the most commonly encountered problems in general practice and emergency medicine. It also provides valuable information to the public on any number of other medical topics.

As another embodiment of the MDATA system a person desiring medical advice and having access to a personal computer PC loads a program into the PC to produce a stand alone medical diagnostic and treatment advice SA MDATA system. Rather than listening to questions and responding via touch tone keypresses or via voice the user responds to questions and directions displayed on the computer screen via a computer input device such as a keyboard or mouse. The diagnosis and or treatment recommendations provided by the MDATA system are the same as that provided by the SA MDATA system. The user of the SA MDATA system can procure updates by contacting the MDATA system sponsor administrator to obtain the most current treatment table information for a particular diagnosis.

In one embodiment there is a computerized medical diagnostic system comprising a memory configured to store a data structure wherein data in the data structure can be referenced by specification of a plurality of attributes representative of a medical condition of a patient wherein a first attribute corresponds to a cause of disease and a second attribute corresponds to an anatomic system and a processor in data communication with the memory configured to make a diagnosis based on the data in the data structure.

In another embodiment there is a computerized method of medical diagnosis the method comprising ascertaining a plurality of attributes of a medical condition of a patient wherein a first attribute is associated with a cause of disease and a second attribute is associated with an anatomic system modifying a data structure based on the attributes and diagnosing the medical condition of a patient based on the data structure.

In yet another embodiment there is a computerized method of medical diagnosis the method comprising associating a data structure stored in a memory on a computer with a patient wherein data in the data structure can be referenced by specification of a plurality of attributes representative of a medical condition of the patient wherein a first attribute corresponds to a cause of disease and a second attribute corresponds to an anatomic system ascertaining a plurality of attributes of a first medical condition of the patient modifying the stored data structure based on the plurality of attributes of the first medical condition ascertaining a plurality of attributes of a second medical condition of the patient modifying the stored data structure based on the plurality of attributes of the second medical condition and outputting a diagnosis based on the data in the data structure.

The following detailed description of the preferred embodiments presents a description of certain specific embodiments to assist in understanding the claims. However the present invention can be embodied in a multitude of different ways as defined and covered by the claims.

For convenience the following description will be outlined into the following 22 principal sections Introduction System Overview Operating Features of the MDATA System Authoring Language Run Time Operation Software Structure Top Level Flow Login Process Registration Process Evaluation Process The Meta Function Mental Status Examination Semantic Discrepancy Evaluator Routine Past Medical History Routine Physical Self Examination Symptom Severity Analysis Treatment Table The MDATA System Paradigm Video Imaging Benefits of the MDATA System Optional System Configuration and Summary of Advantages of the Present Invention.

A consultation for a person seeking medical advice begins with a telephone call to the medical diagnostic and treatment advice MDATA system of the present invention. The MDATA system asks the caller specific questions and then analyzes each response.

Voice recognition and interactive voice response technology allow callers to respond to yes no and multiple choice questions either by speaking directly into the telephone or by using the touch tone pad of their telephone.

Easy access to the information in the MDATA system is made possible by a natural user interface. The computer driven dialogue consists of simple yes no and multiple choice questions. The questions and treatment recommendations are very simply worded yet skillfully designed to reflect the accumulated experience of many physicians in conducting patient interviews.

Although all the MDATA system s questions are designed to be easily understood unforeseen situations will inevitably arise. For this reason hierarchical staffing is implemented. As an example for every 10 telephone lines one operator fully trained in triage and the MDATA system will be available. For every 10 operators there will be one registered nurse in attendance and for every 10 registered nurses there will be one physician in attendance. Staffing requirements are adjusted as the system is refined toward optimal efficiency. The MDATA system does not require the operator or the registered nurse to make any medical decisions.

Referring to the components of a presently preferred embodiment of the computerized medical diagnostic and treatment advice MDATA system of the present invention are shown. A personal computer PC includes a plurality of components within an enclosure . A plurality of telephone lines interface the public telephone network to the computer . As an example one of telephone lines is shown to be switched via network to connect with a telephone that is used by a person desiring medical advice user . Throughout this document the words user caller and patient are used interchangeably. However it will be understood that the caller may be acting as a proxy for the patient. If this is the case the caller will be registered as an assistant for the patient.

The hardware and system software were assembled with two basic concepts in mind portability to other operating systems and the use of industry standard components. In this way the system can be more flexible and will allow free market competition to continuously improve the product while at the same time decrease costs. While specific hardware and software will be referenced it will be understood that a panoply of different components could be used in the present system.

The system currently runs on the PC with an Intel 80486 microprocessor. Telephony functions use Dialogic Corporation s D 41D voice processing board based on a digital signal processor DSP . The voice processing VP board performs several functions including interfacing the telephone lines decoding touch tone signals speech recording and speech playback. Touch tone signals are also known as dual tone multiple frequency DTMF signals. A group of one to four telephone lines connect to the VP board . The computer may include a plurality of VP boards based on how many phone line connections are desired for the system . Speech recognition is achieved using Voice Processing Corporation s speech recognition VPRO 4 board also DSP based . The voice recognition VR board performs several functions including recognizing utterances and returning an index number of a recognition confidence level. The VR board and the VP board both connect to an industry standard architecture ISA bus . The ISA bus interconnects the microprocessor with a plurality of peripherals through controller circuits chips or boards .

The VP board also connects to a VPRO Adapt board via an analog audio bus that is called Analog Extension Bus. Four simultaneous channels provide a 96 kbit second data transfer rate. Each channel corresponds to a telephone line connected to the VP board and is associated with a current patient consultation. The Adapt board further connects to a digital audio bus . The VR board also connects to the digital audio bus . The Adapt board performs analog to digital signal conversion to a VPC proprietary digital pulse code modulation PCM format. The digital bus can accommodate 32 channels and has a data transfer rate of 2.048 Mbits second.

The computer ISA bus has a plurality of peripherals connected to it through adapters or controllers. A video adapter board preferably at VGA or better resolution interconnects to a video monitor . A serial communication circuit interfaces a pointing device such as a mouse . A parallel communication circuit may be used in place of circuit in another embodiment. A keyboard controller circuit interfaces a keyboard . A small computer systems interface SCSI adapter such as model 1542C made by Adaptec provides a SCSI bus to which a 500 Mb or greater hard disk drive and dual Bernoulli 150 Mb disk drives are preferably attached. The hard drive stores database files such as the patient files speech files and binary support files.

A main memory connects to the microprocessor . In the presently preferred embodiment the MDATA system operates under DOS version 5.0 operating system . The system software is written in Microsoft C C version 7.0 using structured programming techniques. An algorithm processor includes a parser and supporting functions that manipulate a memory variable symbol table and a run time stack which will be described hereinbelow. Sequiter Software Inc. Codebase 5.0 allows access to X base compatible database records stored on the hard drive . The MDATA system also includes two new authoring languages one each is used in two embodiments of the system which will be discussed hereinbelow.

The Voice Processing Corporation VPC VPro 4 VR board has eight voice recognition channels which by default are associated one to one with the Dialogic D 41D channels. VPC s pioneering work in the voice processing field is in the area of continuous speech. This allows a person to speak a multiple digit number in a natural manner without pausing after each digit. VPC supplies two continuous speech vocabularies one vocabulary contains the digits 1 through 9 plus zero and oh and the other contains just the two words yes and no . The vendor supplied digits continuous speech vocabulary is used by the system . In the presently preferred embodiment if the score is 75 or better the response is unconditionally accepted. If the score is between 20 and 74 the digits recognized are read back and the caller is asked to accept or reject the digits. In another embodiment of the system the above score thresholds are implemented as tunable parameters. The scoring parameters are stored in a configuration file that is manipulated off line by a utility program and is read by the run time system at initialization.

VPC also provides a few discrete vocabularies. Discrete vocabularies contain one or two word utterances. The vendor supplied discrete speech vocabulary of the months of the year is used in the on line patient registration process. A speaker independent discrete speech vocabulary consisting of the words yes no backup continue help operator pause quit and repeat has been developed using a very powerful set of utilities supplied by VPC Scripter and Trainer. These utilities are for collecting samples and training the vocabulary.

The VR board has the minimum of two MB memory installed. The default memory configuration has a partition for both continuous vocabularies and a partition for one discrete vocabulary. Additional discrete vocabularies may be downloaded if the on board memory is reconfigured.

The VR board has four digital signal processors DSP s from which VPC derived eight voice recognition channels. Each of these eight recognition resources is referred to as a VPro Speech Processor VSP . Discrete vocabulary recognition requires one VSP continuous vocabulary recognition requires two adjacent VSP s. The MDATA system has a VSP resource manager in the resp.c software module. This resource manager allocates VSP s in a dynamic manner to VP board channels on a demand basis. As soon as the system receives a response voice or DTMF it releases the VSP s associated with the caller s VP board channel.

The MDATA system uses VPC s application programming interface API for the C programming language. This makes the application vendor specific to VPC but also allows the system to utilize all the powerful API features e.g. on line creation of discrete speaker dependent vocabularies used for voice pattern matching or voice printing.

The VPC API supports both continuous speech vocabulary CSV and discrete speech vocabulary DSV recognition.

The voice processing VP board supports speech recording and playback as well as touch tone DTMF signal detection and decoding. A device driver associated with the VP board is loaded into system memory during load operations. The device driver supports communications between the VP board and the application code at run time e.g. when a person is seeking medical advice . Through a shared memory segment the device driver sends event and status data to the application code in real time as events occur on the associated telephone line. These events include the ring of an incoming call touch tone key pressed by the caller and the hang up signal. The VP board plays back speech messages that are stored on the hard drive . The algorithm processor sends a selected speech file having an encoded speech message that is retrieved from the hard drive to the VP board at the appropriate time for speech message playback. A speech message can be of variable length with a typical message about one to two minutes in length. Several speech messages may be chained together to produce an extended spoken message e.g. giving instructions to the patient. During speech file playback the VP board is monitoring touch tone response from the caller. The VP board may be configured to interrupt speech file playback when a touch tone signal is detected.

System Operating Contexts The system has an activity flag in the port status block for each patient currently using the system to keep track of which state the associated VP board channel is in 

Voice Keywords and DTMF Command Keys The system is responsive to the following voice keywords and DTMF keys when it is in a prompting state i.e. not in response to a menu message 

One of the MDATA system s main objectives is to bring together highly qualified medical experts encode their knowledge in a central location and make it available to everyone. A new and unique authoring language is used by the MDATA system to help accomplish this objective.

Each day specialists perform the same tasks over and over. They enact the same diagnostic ritual of solving a familiar problem. At the same time however primary care physicians attempt to find the best path through the diagnostic maze of an unfamiliar problem. This process is inefficient and fraught with error.

In medicine there is generally one best way to do things. Instead of physicians spending valuable time duplicating tasks the MDATA system utilizes medical experts from each medical specialty who write detailed algorithms for the treatment of the 100 or so most commonly encountered complaints in family practice and emergency medicine. These algorithms are carefully and specifically designed to elicit historical data and physical findings over the telephone rather than in face to face interactions.

Several experts could work together to thoroughly research one particular complaint as well as to anticipate the full spectrum of possible problems and patient responses. These experts could also provide and maintain the MDATA system treatment table as well as the imaging modality of choice and laboratory test of choice tables. These concepts will be described hereinbelow.

Carefully crafted questions used in the taking of a medical history are the main tools that the MDATA system uses to assess the problems of patients. The key to getting a good history is to ask the right questions. In a sense in the diagnostic process questions are like tests. It is important to note that the right questions are basically always right they don t change. Although they may be refined over time in general once excellent and well crafted questions are developed they are good for a very long time. Of course as new diseases are discovered e.g. toxic shock syndrome and AIDS new sets of diagnostic questions are developed that are disease specific.

The questions used by an earlier generation of physicians who did not have any of the latest imaging modalities types or methods are far more sensitive and precise in diagnosing a patient s problem than the questions used by doctors today. The MDATA system makes use of fine nuances of language to diagnose patients as well as to determine when certain tests or imaging studies are necessary.

The MDATA system s statistic generating capabilities enable the system to analyze the effectiveness of the questions used in the diagnostic process. As a result physicians benefit from the immense amount of statistical information that is gathered regarding the wording of questions asked in taking medical histories. For example exactly what percentage of patients who answer yes to the question Is this the worst headache of your life actually have a subarachnoid hemorrhage Although this is a classic description of this problem the exact probability of having this kind of brain hemorrhage after answering yes to this question is not presently known.

Currently doctors can only estimate the probability of certain conditions based on history. By applying the statistical information that is generated the MDATA system not only provides the patient with advice that is continually improving but it will also be able to pass along these probabilities to the entire medical community.

To function optimally the MDATA system tries to gain as much medical information about its patients as possible. Although a first time caller is given excellent advice more specific advice can be given if the system has more information. Therefore the MDATA system asks patients for their complete medical history. The MDATA system can either obtain the patient s medical record over the telephone or it can mail or fax a detailed questionnaire to each patient. The patient can then gather the necessary information at their convenience. The MDATA system will always be available by telephone to clarify any questions the patient may have.

The MDATA system uses the International Classification of Diseases ICD 9 CM codes to help summarize the information it has about a patient. This world standard is a comprehensive numerical system used to classify the entire spectrum of medical diseases. ICD 9 CM codes are also used to classify specific procedures performed e.g. appendectomy as well as the morphology of neoplasm i.e. tissue diagnosis of a cancer .

In addition the MDATA system uses ICD 9 CM E Codes to classify environmental events circumstances and conditions as the cause of injury poisoning and other adverse effects. These codes are particularly helpful for storing information about what drugs the patient has taken or is currently taking as well as the context e.g. therapeutic use accident poisoning suicide attempt in which they were or are being taken. For example E942.1 is the code for the therapeutic use of digoxin. Medications are also cross categorized according to the classification done by the American Hospital Formulary Service List AHFS Numbers. The MDATA system also uses V Codes to classify other types of circumstances or events such as vaccinations potential health hazards related to personal and family history and exposure to toxic chemicals.

It is estimated that the alphanumeric component of a patient s medical history will not exceed 1 000 atoms or pieces of information. An atom is considered herein to be a separate identifiable data item or point. With this assumption the medical records of every person on the planet could currently be stored on approximately 1 000 optical disks.

While a patient interacts with the MDATA system the system is constantly determining what questions to ask based upon the information it has about the patient. Just as a physician gathers relevant pieces of information from his or her dialogue with a patient the MDATA system flags and later stores all pertinent pieces of information that it learns from each interaction with its patient. Therefore certain questions because their answers remain the same need not be repeated. For example if the MDATA system learns that a patient s mother has suffered from migraine headaches it will never have to ask for this information again.

Again the more information the MDATA system has about a patient the more specific is its advice. It is not uncommon for the MDATA system to give different advice to different patients calling for the same complaint. In other words the advice given is patient specific. Not only can the MDATA system s advice be different for different patients but there are times when the advice given to the same patient calling for the same complaint but at different times is different. For example one of a group of functions called meta keeps track of the number of times the MDATA system has been consulted for the same problem. Once a threshold is reached the MDATA system advises the patient that the number of consultations alone for the same complaint may signify a problem. The system then makes an appropriate recommendation.

Before the MDATA system stores any information the system verifies its accuracy. To accomplish this task confirmation loops are used. Any piece of information that will become a part of the patient s medical record is sent through a confirmation loop where the system asks the patient to verify the accuracy of the information that the system has collected. The confirmation loop enables the system to verify new patient information and make corrections before it enters this information into the patient s medical record.

The MDATA system uses a new authoring language that is specifically designed to allow medical knowledge to be encoded into a usable computer program. The presently preferred voice response or telephony version of the MDATA system is written in object oriented Microsoft C C version 7.0. This allows the MDATA system to easily interface with industry standard database programs including those that are SQL based as well as to be portable to other operating systems. The operating system is transparent to the user.

Before the development of the MDATA system s authoring language there was no practical way for medical experts to encode their knowledge into a meaningful useful and accessible structure. Although other computer languages have been used to build medical expert systems they have almost always required a knowledge engineer and a programmer to be involved. Quite often the knowledge encoded in these systems could only be accessed and fully understood by physicians. Typically the programmer would try to translate the doctor s diagnostic skills and treatment rules into computer code. This separation of the physician s knowledge from the encoded treatment recommendations often engendered anxiety in the physician and has at times led to inaccurate treatment recommendations.

The MDATA system s authoring language however is designed to allow physicians to transfer their knowledge into a computer program that can be directly accessed by non medically trained personnel. Recursive and iterative techniques are used to acquire the knowledge from the expert and assemble it in a way that allows it to be immediately transposed into the MDATA system s algorithms. Because of the simple interface of the language and because a formula for writing the algorithms has already been developed physicians who are not computer literate can encode their knowledge as well as understand exactly how that process takes place.

The MDATA system s authoring language allows flat information to be restructured into a hierarchical or layered format in which the arrangement of the knowledge conveys meaning. Thus a textbook description of a disease can be transposed into a form that allows useful treatment recommendations to be made.

The new language also allows the formation of a structure in which multiple overlays of screening questions combined with the application of recursive techniques sequentially exclude some diagnoses while at the same time reaching treatment recommendations. The MDATA system s simplicity and elegance would not be possible without the new language.

The MDATA system s authoring language allows an algorithm programmer to retrieve information from a patient s medical record request additional information from the patient and guide the flow of algorithm execution based on medical history and the patient s responses. The language allows the programmer to implement an algorithm in a natural scripted style.

The course of an algorithm is determined by caller responses to questions that the MDATA system asks. For simple yes no questions the flow of interaction can be described by a binary tree. Multiple choice questions e.g. menus provide multiple branches in the tree. Each question can be considered a node and the acceptable responses to this question are branches leading to the next question node . Using this abstraction of an algorithm one can draw a directed graph also known as a node map of the nodes and branches of an algorithm beginning with the initial question and ending with all possible terminal points.

Referring to a process for translating a medical algorithm written in the authoring language will be described. illustrates an ASCII American Standard Code for Information Interchange format text file as an input to a translation utility . An ASCII file can be created by use of a text editor or a word processing program may need to export to the ASCII format . The ASCII file contains node definitions conforming to the syntax briefly described hereinbelow.

The purpose of the ASCII node definition translator utility xlat.exe along with functions in pars.c and util.c is to convert a human readable document into a machine readable format that the MDATA system reads at run time to process an algorithm. This utility may be considered to be a preprocessor the translation must be accomplished prior to run time.

The output of the utility is a set of binary NOD BLK records written to a node table filename of node.fos and a set of binary list files in a subdirectory list listxx xxyy where xx is the first two digits of the node number and yy are the last two digits . Four list files are shown as an example. Each list file e.g. contains a next table i.e. the next node after this one a message play list for this node and a work list i.e. one or more things to do at this node before beginning speech playback . The binary record written to the node table node.fos has fields containing the node number which is redundant the record s position in this file also indicates the node number the node s type attribute Menu Link Prompt Yes No Return Hangup and a parent node number.

The node table is a table of 10 000 NOD BLK records. This table is indexed by a node number e.g. the fiftieth record corresponds to node . The contents of the individual node records may be viewed by selecting Display Node while running the ednode utility. The node records are modified by either using the ednode utility or when translating node definitions from ASCII to the node file with the xlat utility.

One of the following keywords is necessary as the first item on each line but only one keyword is accepted per line any excess information will be discarded.

A select set of math functions relational operators and nested if then else statements are supported. A pound sign or a hyphen in the first position on a new line will cause the translator to skip over the rest of the line. This is useful for inserting comments or delimiting between individual node definitions. The translator also disregards blank lines.

In order for a node to be properly defined a minimum number of keywords must be present for each node and other keywords must be included depending on the node type. The minimum keyword set for a properly defined node is 

The first keyword in a node definition must be Node. The other keywords may be given in any order. The next occurrence of the Node keyword will invoke a completeness test. If the completeness test is successful then the node definition is saved in machine readable binary format and translation continues with the new Node line. A set of reserved language keywords is listed in Table 1.

Referring to the run time interaction among the hardware and software components of the MDATA system will be described. As previously mentioned algorithm processor includes the parser and supporting functions that manipulate the memory variable symbol table and the run time stack. For a selected medical algorithm a node record is read from the node table and a list file is read from the plurality of list files . The algorithm processor also interacts with the Vpro voice recognition VR board for speech recognition and with the Dialogic voice processing VP board for speech playback and DTMF detection. The VP board further is interconnected with a set of speech files that are stored on a portion of hard disk and with one of the telephone lines that connects via the telephone network to the patient s telephone . The VR board further connects with the voice print vocabularies previously described also stored on a portion of hard disk . The algorithm processor utilizes the speech recognition speech playback and DTMF detection resources as directed by the medical algorithm that is retrieved from the node table and the list files .

Referring to and several data structures are utilized at run time. These data structures are described as follows 

The work list has the non playback tasks that are performed at each node. There is one work list for each node and it is identified with the work keyword in the ASCII node definition file. The work list may be empty. Each time the system transits to a new node it will execute the work list. If the patient repeats a node the system will not execute the work list again it will simply replay the message s . If the patient requests the system to back up the node map the system will execute the work list of the node it backs up to. Typical tasks in the work list involve manipulating objects on the run time stack or in the symbol table testing for the presence of memory variables configuring past medical history or current medical condition objects or writing database records. An example of a complex work list follows 

Each node has the next table or list. The next list indices range from 1 to 9 inclusive. The next list contains either a single node number or an if expression. For all node types except the Hangup node there will be at least one next list 

Speech files may be of an arbitrary length. A message may be informational a list of menu options or a yes no question. A two paragraph or under one minute limit has been adopted as a style convention for the presently preferred embodiment. Typically a node is programmed as a sequence of Yes No nodes with informational Link nodes interspersed as needed. When there is a lengthy discussion the speech is recorded in multiple files. To simplify algorithm programming and enhance readability viz. eliminate long chains of link nodes the Link node s play list may contain up to ten message numbers.

Upon arrival at a Link node the system positions a current message pointer at the beginning of the play list trivial case single message play list interesting case multiple message play list . As playback proceeds the current message pointer moves down the play list. After the system plays the last message on the list it moves on to the next node.

If the caller issues a backup command the system will move the current message pointer back one message and resume playback. If the pointer was at the beginning of the list e.g. trivial case the system backs up to the previous node and places the current message pointer at the beginning of the play list. If there is more than one message in the list the system cues the pointer to the last message in the list. The system then resumes playback. In the pause mode when the caller issues the continue command the system will resume playback at the current message.

One of the drawbacks of the traditional doctor patient relationship is the short amount of time that physicians are able to spend with patients. The MDATA system however allows patients as much time as they wish to learn about their problem as well as to obtain information on any number of other medical topics.

Through the Information mode feature of the MDATA system callers can learn about a disease process an illness or the latest treatment for any disease without adding any information to their personal medical record. Although the system keeps track of the interaction it is labeled as an Information mode session. The record of the caller s path through the system is not used as the basis for any future advice nor is it considered in generating system statistics.

The Information mode is not limited to complaints for which the MDATA system offers medical advice. Information about early detection and treatment of many other diseases as well as the latest advances in medicine can be made available through the Information mode.

Referring to through as an example a run time sequence of steps of how a patient may traverse a main menu node map several steps into a chest pain algorithm node map will be described. Six nodes with a portion of an associated symbol table will be discussed.

At the algorithm processor loads the first node represented by node block . The variables for Age Sex and Real mode were loaded into the symbol table during the login process which will be described hereinbelow . Throughout this example the help list is empty i.e. no help information is played for the patient. The work list sets the Problem variable of the symbol table to be Menu. Then the system begins playback of message . This message gives the patient a menu of choices to choose from. The Digits entry equal to one means that a one digit response is expected from the patient. The patient may respond by pressing a touch tone DTMF key on the telephone or speak the choice response into the telephone handset microphone. In this example the patient selects menu option 1 . The parser evaluates the Next list based on the patient selection and branches to node .

At the algorithm processor loads node represented by node block . The work list is empty so the system goes right to playing back message which presents another menu of choices to the user. The Next list has four nodes for possible branch points. In this example the patient selects menu option 1 for a chest pain complaint. The parser evaluates the Next list based on the patient selection and branches to node .

At the algorithm processor loads node represented by node block . The work list command is to update the value of Problem in symbol table to CCHP chest pain . Then the system begins playback of message . No response is required from the patient for a Link type node. The Next list has two nodes for possible branch points depending on the value of symbol table variable Real. The parser evaluates the If expression in the Next list for the value of Real and in this example branches to node .

At the algorithm processor loads node represented by node block . The work list command is to write a Meta consultation record for future use by a Meta function. The play list is empty so no message is played. No response is required from the patient for a Link type node. The main purpose of this node is to write the Meta consultation record because the system is currently in Real mode for this patient . The Next list has only one node so no decisions are necessary by the parser which in this example branches to node .

At the algorithm processor loads node represented by node block . The work list is empty in this node so the system goes right to playing back message which presents a yes no type of question to the user. The Next list has two nodes for possible branch points depending on the response of the patient. In this example the patient responds no and the parser evaluates the Next list based on the patient selection and branches to node .

At the algorithm processor loads node represented by node block . The work list is empty in this node so the system goes right to playing back message which presents a yes no type of question to the user. The Next list has two nodes for possible branch points depending on the response of the patient. If the patient answers yes to the question the parser branches to node but if the patient answers no to the question the parser branches to node .

Referring to the system utilizes eight principal separate processes and seven related databases. A patient login process is used by the system to identify a patient who has previously registered into the system by prompting for a patient identification number PIN . An assistant login process is used by the system to identify an assistant who has previously registered into the system by prompting for an assistant identification number AIN . An assisted patient login process is used by the system to identify a patient who has previously registered into the system by prompting for the patient identification number. If the caller is the patient a patient registration process is used by the system to register new or first time patients. If the caller is not the patient an assistant registration process is used by the system to register new or first time assistants. Then if the patient is not already registered an assisted patient registration process is used by the system to register the patient. These processes will be further described hereinbelow.

Once a caller has logged in or registered the system provides a choice of two other processes in the current embodiment. The first of these processes is the evaluation process that performs a patient diagnosis. The second of these is a treatment table process to obtain current treatment information for a particular disease or diagnosis. In another embodiment other choices are added to access other medical information processes.

Associated with these eight processes are a patient and assistant enrollment database a consultation history database a patient response database a medical history objects database a patient medical history database a pending database and a patient medication database that are described as follows 

Referring to and the top level flow of the MDATA system software will be described. The telephone number used to access the MDATA system may vary in various embodiments of the system. If the sponsoring agency or hospital wishes to provide access to the MDATA system at no cost to the caller then a toll free 800 service number can be used. If the sponsoring agency or hospital wishes to recover the costs of running the MDATA system from the caller it may use a pay per call or premium charge number e.g. 900 service . Current Procedural Terminology CPT 4 codes are available to describe and bill third party payers for telephone consultations. They are a listing of the descriptive terms and identifying codes for reporting medical services and procedures. CPT 4 codes are the most widely accepted nomenclature for reporting physician services to insurance companies.

Beginning at a start state a person desiring medical advice calls the telephone number for the MDATA system on a telephone line . The caller may be the patient or may be an assistant e.g. parent relative or friend that is helping the patient. Moving to state the system answers the call automatically and greets the caller with an introductory greeting message by playing back a speech file stored on the hard drive by use of the VP board . Proceeding at state the MDATA system asks each patient who calls the system a series of initial screening questions. These questions are designed to identify patients who are critically ill they are not designed to identify the patient s problem. The initial screening questions enable the system to filter out patients who require immediate medical attention.

Moving to decision state any patient found to be critically ill is instructed to dial the emergency response telephone number 911 at state or will be automatically connected to the nearest emergency medical services system in the patient s area. The telephone call is terminated by the computer at state . The following are examples of initial screening questions 

If the system determines that the patient is experiencing a medical emergency it may provide the patient with a menu of emergency medical procedures at state . In situations where the patient or the caller for the patient is far from the nearest emergency help e.g. a rural setting the caller may need to initiate emergency procedures immediately. The menu of emergency medical procedures provides several choices to the caller. If the caller presses touch tone key 1 or speaks the word one into the telephone mouthpiece the computer branches to state wherein well known CPR cardiopulmonary resuscitation information is recited. If the caller has a speakerphone capability associated with the telephone being used the caller may be able to listen to and perform the instructions given by the system in a hands free manner away from the telephone. If the caller presses touch tone key 2 or speaks the word two into the telephone mouthpiece the computer branches to state wherein well known Heimlich Hug information for choking is recited. At the completion of either state or state the telephone call ends at state .

If the patient is determined at state not to have a medical emergency i.e. the MDATA system is satisfied that no immediately life threatening condition is present the computer moves to a decision state to determine if the caller is the actual patient. If so the computer proceeds to a decision state to determine if the patient has previously registered or ever consulted with the system i.e. is not a new or first time caller. If so the system verifies the patient s identification and retrieves their medical record at the patient login process which will be further described hereinbelow. At the completion of process the computer proceeds through off page connector C to state . If the patient is not registered the MDATA system proceeds to the patient registration process for a new patient which will be described hereinbelow. At the completion of process the computer proceeds through off page connector C to state on

If the caller is not the patient as determined at state the computer proceeds through off page connector A to state on . There will be times when the patient may not be able to use the MDATA system directly e.g. due to injury weakness or altered level of consciousness. In these cases an assistant may interact with the system on behalf of the patient.

An assistant registers with the system through the assistant registration process which will be described hereinbelow. The assistant registration record is identical to the patient registration record in structure but three fields have special significance for an assistant ASST PERM ASST EXP and RELATIONS. The ASST PERM field is a Boolean flag that can only be set true off line by the system administrator who has verified through separate means that a relationship exists between a patient and an assistant. The relationships are one to many i.e. a patient may have one or more assistants and an assistant may be related to more than one patient. The ASST PERM flag may also be constrained by the ASST EXP field which contains a timestamp for the expiration of the ASST PERM attribute. If the ASST PERM flag is true then the RELATIONS pointers will point to one or more patient records for whom this assistant is a permanent assistant otherwise the RELATIONS field will be empty.

The medical information gathered during an assisted consultation is written to the patient s medical record only if the following three conditions are met 

The system establishes at state whether the caller is the patient or an assistant. If the caller is not the patient then the system asserts that the caller is an assistant and at a decision state determines if the assistant is registered. If the assistant is not already registered with the system the system enrolls the new assistant at the assistant registration process . If the assistant is already registered with the system the computer performs the assistant login process . At the completion of either process or process the computer advances to a decision state .

If the patient is not already registered with the system as determined at decision state then the system allows the assistant to register a new patient at the assisted patient registration process . However if the patient is already registered with the system as determined at state the computer performs the assisted patient login process . At the completion of process or process the computer proceeds through off page connector B to a decision state on

At decision state the computer determines if the patient s date of birth is in the patient s medical record. If so the computer proceeds through off page connector C to state on . If not the system attempts to get the patient s date of birth. Moving to state the system asks the assistant if the patient s date of birth is known. If so the computer advances to state to request the patient s date of birth. At state the system recites the patient s date of birth obtained at state . At a decision state the assistant determines if the date of birth is correct as recited by the system . If not the computer loops back to state to request the patient s date of birth again. If the patient s date of birth is correct as determined at state the computer flags the date of birth for saving in the patient s medical record at state and proceeds to state on

If the patient s date of birth is not known as determined at state the computer proceeds to state wherein the system requests the assistant to provide an approximate age of the patient. The age is an important parameter used in the evaluation process and treatment table . At state the system recites the patient s approximate age obtained at state . At a decision state the assistant determines if the age is correct as recited by the system . If not the computer loops back to state to request the patient s approximate age again. If the patient s approximate age is correct as determined at state the system advises the assistant at state to get the patient s actual date of birth before the next consultation and proceeds to state on . The system uses the approximate age in the consultation during the evaluation process and the treatment table .

At state on the system presents the caller with a system selection menu. Here the caller is asked to select from among four choices diagnostic system treatment table a future process function or end call as described below 

At the completion of the evaluation process treatment table process or future process the system loops back to state and recites the system selection menu to the caller. If the caller chooses the End Call selection at state the MDATA system moves to a decision state . At decision state the system determines if process process or process did not occur in Information mode i.e. did occur in either Real mode or Pending Mode and examines the patient s symbol table to determine if any of the configured memory variables are past medical history conditions that need to be saved to the patient s medical history file. If both conditions are true at state the system advances to a decision state to determine if the consultation is being performed in Real mode. If not the consultation is being performed in Pending mode and the system then writes any new patient information obtained during the consultation to the Pending file . If state proves to be true i.e. Real mode for each past medical condition that needs to be saved the MDATA system asks the patient at state to grant permission to save the datum to the patient s medical history file and to confirm that the datum is correct. For example during a consultation for cough the MDATA system learned that the patient has been diagnosed as being HIV positive. The system will ask May I record the information about your HIV diagnosis in your medical record If the patient responds yes then the system will ask Please verify that your diagnosis for HIV was positive is this correct If the patient responds yes then the system writes this fact to the patient s medical history file. After confirmation each data item is stored in the patient s file in the patient medical history database .

At the completion of either updating the history database at state state proves to be false or at the completion of state the system moves to a decision state . Before the MDATA system ends the consultation with the patient it presents a summary of all the advice it has given. The patient is asked to write down and repeat back the key points. The MDATA system then gives the patient the option of receiving a summary of the consultation session and specific recommendations provided by the system by either facsimile or first class mail. If a fax is desired the system asks the patient for a fax number at state . The patient also has the option to send a summary of the consultation to his or her health care provider or specialist. Proceeding to state the computer adds the transcript of the current telephone session to a fax queue for subsequent transmission. At the completion of state or if the system determined at state that the session transcript was not to be faxed the telephone call is terminated at state .

Referring now to and the patient login process defined in will be described. This process is called if the patient has previously called and registered with the system . Beginning at a start state the computer moves to state and initializes a match flag to true. The match flag is checked later in this process in conjunction with setting the mode of the consultation. Proceeding to state the computer prompts the patient for the patient ID identification number PIN that is assigned during the registration process. The patient registration process will be described in conjunction with and . Proceeding to a decision state the computer determines whether the PIN is valid. If not the computer determines at a decision state if less than three tries at entering the PIN have been attempted. If so the computer loops back to state to repeat the request for the PIN. However if three attempts at entering the PIN have been made as determined at state the computer plays a polite message that advises the patient that the login attempt failed and terminates the call at state . The computer reports the failed login attempt to the system administrator at the sponsoring agency hospital or other organization. The patient is allowed to reregister as a new patient however to permit access to the needed medical information. The system administrator resolves this type of situation off line.

If the patient has correctly entered a valid PIN as determined at state the computer moves to a decision state to determine if the patient identified by the PIN has a voice print or sample voice waveform on file in the system . If not the computer proceeds to state to record the voice print of the patient e.g. the patient s pronunciation of his or her full name. The patient s voice print may not be on file for example if the patient could not provide a voice print during the assisted patient registration process in a prior consultation. At the completion of recording the voice print at state the computer advances to state wherein the match flag is set to false to indicate that the patient s voice print was recorded during the current login.

If the patient identified by the PIN has a voice print on file in the system as determined at state the computer proceeds to state and prompts the patient to pronounce his or her full name. Moving to a decision state the computer determines whether the voice sample obtained at state passes the matching criteria. If not the computer proceeds to state and recites a message that the current voice sample does not pass the matching criteria. In the presently preferred embodiment the current voice sample is compared to the reference voice sample recorded during the patient registration process or the assisted patient registration process . Because the voice samples did not match as determined at state the computer sets the match flag to false at state . In this case the match flag is set to false to indicate that one of the security checking methods has failed. However the process continues at state after the match flag is set to false at either state or .

If the voice sample passed the matching criteria at state the computer advances to state and recites a message that the current voice sample passed the matching criteria. This security check condition is now satisfied and the match flag remains set to true. At the completion of state the computer moves to state . At state the computer verifies the sex and age of the patient by reciting the sex and age as stored in the enrollment database obtained during the patient registration process to the patient. At a decision state the patient responds to the correctness of the recited information. If the sex or birth date information is not correct the computer moves to state to request the correct information. The computer then proceeds back to state to verify the information received at state . If the result of the decision state is true i.e. the sex and age are correct the computer moves through off page connector A to a decision state on to determine if the patient desires to conduct the telephone session in Real mode or Information mode. If Information mode is desired the computer moves to a decision state to determine if the patient s sex and age are to be used during the Information mode consultation. If not the computer moves to state to request an age and sex to use in a hypothetical situation during the Information mode session. Moving to a decision state the computer recites the sex and age obtained at state and asks the patient to confirm that this information is correct. If not the computer moves back to state to request the age and sex again. When decision state is true or the patient s age and sex are to be used during this consultation as determined at state the computer moves to state and sets the operating mode to be Information mode.

If decision state is determined to be Real mode the computer moves to a decision state to check if the match flag is true. If not the system advises the patient at state that the current consultation is to be performed in Pending mode. The operating mode is set to be Pending mode at state . If the match flag is true as determined at state the computer sets the operating mode to be Real mode at state .

At the completion of setting the operating mode at either state state or state the computer moves to a decision state . At decision state the computer determines if the patient desires to review the touch tone commands described during the registration process. If so the computer advances to state and recites the touch tone commands. At the completion of state or if the patient did not wish to review the touch tone commands the computer proceeds to a decision state wherein the computer determines if the patient desires to review the voice keywords described during the registration process. If so the computer advances to state and recites the voice keywords. At the completion of state or if the patient did not wish to review the voice keywords the computer proceeds to a decision state wherein the computer determines if the patient desires to enable prompting. If so the computer advances to state and enables prompting. If not prompting is disabled at state . To enable prompting means that the patient would like to be prompted for responses. This is referred to as hard prompting since this will remain in effect for the duration of the call. If hard prompting is off and the system has difficulty recognizing patient responses the computer turns on soft prompting. After the next successful recognition the computer turns off soft prompting. At the completion of state or the computer returns at state to the top level flow .

Referring now to and the assistant login process defined in will be described. This process is called if the assistant has previously called and registered with the system . Beginning at a start state the computer moves to a state and prompts the assistant for the assistant ID identification number AIN that is assigned during the registration process. The assistant registration process will be described in conjunction with and . Proceeding to a decision state the computer determines whether the AIN is valid. If not the computer determines at a decision state if less than three tries at entering the AIN have been attempted. If so the computer loops back to state to repeat the request for the AIN. However if three attempts at entering the AIN have been made as determined at state the computer plays a polite message that advises the assistant that the login attempt failed and terminates the call at state . The computer reports the failed login attempt to the system administrator at the sponsoring agency hospital or other organization.

If the assistant has correctly entered a valid AIN as determined at state the computer proceeds to state and prompts the caller to pronounce his or her full name. Moving to a decision state the computer determines whether the voice sample obtained at state passes the matching criteria. If not the computer proceeds to state and recites a message that the current voice sample does not pass the matching criteria. In the presently preferred embodiment the current voice sample is compared to the reference voice sample recorded during the assistant registration process . Because the voice samples did not match as determined at state the computer sets the operating mode to Pending at state . In this case Pending mode is set to indicate that one of the security checking methods has failed. However the process continues at state on after Pending mode is set at state .

If the voice sample passed the matching criteria at state the computer advances to state and recites a message that the current voice sample passed the matching criteria. This security check condition is now satisfied. Next three additional checks are performed on the assistant identified by the AIN obtained at state . At a decision state the computer determines if the permanent assistant flag is true as stored in the patient and assistant enrollment database . If so the computer advances to a decision state to determine if the expiration date for the permanent assistant is in the future i.e. the expiration date has not been reached yet. If so the computer advances to a decision state to determine if a relationship exists between the assistant and a patient i.e. the assistant has a relationship pointer to the patient record. If so the operating mode is set to Real at state and then the computer advances through off page connector A to state on . However if any of the decision states or prove to be false the computer moves to state wherein the operating mode is set to Pending.

States through are similar to states through of the patient login process . Because of this similarity only significant differences are discussed in the interest of avoiding repetitiveness. States and verify the assistant s age and sex rather than the patient as in states and . States through are similar to states through of the patient login process . The main distinction is that states pertain to the assistant and states pertain to the patient.

Referring now to and the assisted patient login process defined in will be described. This process is called if both the patient and the assistant have previously called and registered with the system . This process allows the patient flexibility by permitting the assistant to provide help during the login and subsequent consultation. Beginning at a start state the computer moves a state and prompts the assistant for the patient ID identification number PIN that is assigned during the registration process. As previously defined in the assisted patient registration process is called if the patient is not already registered. Process will be described in conjunction with and . Proceeding to a decision state the computer determines whether the PIN is valid. If not the computer determines at a decision state if less than three tries at entering the PIN have been attempted. If so the computer loops back to state to repeat the request for the PIN. However if three attempts at entering the PIN have been made as determined at state the computer plays a polite message that advises the caller that the login attempt failed and terminates the call at state . The computer reports the failed login attempt to the system administrator at the sponsoring agency hospital or other organization. If the assistant doesn t know the PIN and the patient cannot provide it the assistant is allowed to reregister the patient as a new patient at process to permit access to the needed medical information. In this case the assistant may have to estimate the age of the patient if the patient has for example an altered state of consciousness. The system administrator resolves the record keeping in this situation off line.

If the assistant has correctly provided a valid PIN to the system at state the computer moves to a decision state to determine if the patient identified by the PIN has a voice print or sample voice waveform on file in the system . If not the computer moves to a decision state to determine if the patient can provide a voice sample. If not the computer proceeds through off page connector B to state on . If the patient can provide a voice sample as determined at state the computer moves to state to record the voice print of the patient e.g. the patient s pronunciation of his or her full name. The patient s voice print may not be on file for example if the patient could not provide a voice print during the assisted patient registration process in a prior consultation. At the completion of recording the voice print at state the computer proceeds through off page connector B to state on

If the patient identified by the PIN has a voice print on file in the system as determined at state the computer proceeds to state and asks whether the patient can provide a voice sample to the system. If not the computer proceeds through off page connector B to state on . States are similar to states respectively of the patient login process . Because of this similarity only significant differences are discussed in the interest of avoiding repetitiveness. At the completion of state i.e. the patient s voice sample does not pass the matching criteria the computer proceeds through off page connector B to state on . At the completion of state i.e. the patient s voice sample does pass the matching criteria the computer proceeds through off page connector A to state on

At the completion of state i.e. the patient s voice print is recorded state or state i.e. the patient cannot provide a voice sample or state i.e. the voice sample match fails the system continues process at state on . For the three situations just described in this process the computer sets the operating mode to Pending at state . The system then advises the caller at state that new patient information will not be saved to the patient s medical record because the consultation is in Pending mode until the information is verified off line.

At the completion of state i.e. the voice sample passes the computer continues process at state wherein the operating mode is set to Real. The system then advises the caller at state that new patient information will be saved to the patient s medical record.

At the completion of state or state the computer moves to state . States and verify the patient s age and sex similar to states and . States through are similar to states through of the patient login process . The main distinction is that states are directed to the assistant and states are directed to the patient.

Referring now to and the patient registration process defined in will be described. This process is called if the patient has not previously called and registered with the system . During the first consultation the MDATA system obtains the patient s age and sex. This is the minimum amount of information that the MDATA system requires in order to give medical advice. The more information the MDATA system has about a patient however the more specific is its advice.

The MDATA system assigns each of its patients a unique patient identification number. In addition when a patient initially registers the patient s own pronunciation of his or her name is recorded digitized and saved to their medical record. Then when the patient calls back the previous recording is retrieved and the patient is asked to repeat their name exactly as they did during registration. The two recordings are then compared to see if they match. This use of voice printing helps to further ensure the security and confidentiality of a patient s medical record.

Beginning at a start state the computer proceeds to state requests the sex of the patient and verifies by repeating the response given by the patient. Moving to a decision state the patient responds by indicating to the system via touch tone key or a voice response whether the repeated information is correct. If not the computer loops back to state to request the information again. When the information is correct at state the computer proceeds to states and to request and verify the birth date of the patient in a similar fashion to states and .

When the decision state is determined to be true the computer proceeds to state and requests the patient to pronounce his or her full name. Moving to state the full name is digitized and stored in a subdirectory on the hard drive indexed by a Patient Identification Number PIN . File names are of the form .vox. The computer accesses a file to retrieve the next available PIN. The path name to the recorded voice file is saved in the patient s record in the enrollment database . In subsequent telephone sessions with the system the patient s voice waveform will be compared to the recorded voice waveform for security and other optional purposes. When the voice waveform is stored the computer moves to state and provides the PIN to the patient. The patient is informed of the importance to save the PIN for use in future consultations with the system .

At the completion of state the computer moves to a decision state to determine if the patient has a MDATA system user pamphlet available. If so the computer moves to state and requests the patient to turn to the pamphlet page that documents the touch tone keys voice keywords and modes. If not the computer moves to a decision state to determine if the patient would like the system to pause to enable the patient to get paper and a writing instrument for writing user instructions. If so the computer pauses at state for 30 seconds. At the completion of the pause at state if the user did not desire a pause at state or after the patient is instructed to turn to the proper page of the pamphlet the computer proceeds to state of via the off page connector A .

At state the system provides an explanation of the touch tone keys to the patient. These keys were described above in relation to the discussion on Voice Keywords and DTMF Command Keys. Moving to state the computer asks if the patient desires to hear the explanation of keys again. If so the computer repeats state . If not the computer advances to state wherein an explanation of the voice keywords is provided to the patient. These keywords were previously described above. Moving to state the computer asks if the patient desires to hear the explanation of keywords again. If so the computer repeats state . If not the computer advances to state wherein an explanation of Real and Information modes is provided to the patient. These modes were previously described above. Moving to state the computer asks if the patient desires to hear the explanation of the modes again. If so the computer repeats state . If not the computer advances to state wherein a summary of new user information is recited to the patient. The summary includes a recap of the two methods of controlling the system voice key words and DTMF and the two interaction modes Real and Info. The computer returns at state to the top level flow .

Referring now to and the assistant registration process defined in will be described. This process is called if the caller is not a registered patient and has not previously called and registered as an assistant with the system . States through are similar to states through of the patient registration process . Because of this similarity only significant differences are discussed in the interest of avoiding repetitiveness. States and pertain to the assistant rather than the patient as in states and respectively. State records the assistant s pronunciation of his or her full name and state saves it in the patient and assistant enrollment database . The system provides an assistant identification number AIN at state . The AIN is used similarly to the PIN in the access of files or records. The remaining states are directed to the assistant also.

Referring now to and the assisted patient registration process defined in will be described. This process is evoked if the caller is not the patient and the patient has not previously called and registered with the system . States through are similar to states through of the patient registration process . Because of this similarity only significant differences are discussed in the interest of avoiding repetitiveness. The main difference is that the assistant is interacting with the system on behalf of the patient during this process and therefore the operating mode is set to Pending at state . States and obtain the patient s sex and age respectively. If the patient cannot provide the age to the assistant and the system the assistant provides an estimated age. The estimated age can be corrected during a subsequent consultation with the system . At state the system asks whether the patient can provide a voice sample of his or her full name. If so the voice waveform is recorded and saved in enrollment database at states and . If the patient cannot provide a voice sample at state the system informs the assistant at state that the patient s voice sample will be requested during the subsequent consultation. Then whether or not a voice sample is recorded the system provides a patient identification number PIN of the patient to the assistant and the patient if coherent at state . The caller is instructed to safeguard the PIN for future consultations by either the patient or the assistant on behalf of the patient. If the assistant and or patient desires to hear the PIN again as determined at a decision state the computer repeats the PIN at state . The computer proceeds through off page connector A to a decision state on . The remaining states in process are directed to the assistant rather than the patient as in states of process .

Referring now to and the evaluation process defined in will be described. This process is called if the patient has selected the Diagnostic System choice in the system selection menu state . Beginning at a start state the computer moves to state and recites a identification method menu to request complaint identification. After the initial screening questions state are completed and a medical record registration function has been opened the MDATA system asks the patient to describe the complaint. The identification of the patient s problem is one of the most important steps in the evaluation process. The system has built in safeguards to ensure that the patient understands the questions and that the MDATA system understands the patient s complaint. For example the system keeps tables of synonyms so that any problem regarding the semantics of a question or a response can be quickly resolved. The complaint may be identified in one of four ways by anatomic system by cause by alphabetic groups or by catalog number .

The easiest and most frequently used way to identify the complaint is by anatomic system i.e. what system is your problem in . Anatomic system refers to basic body systems such as cardiovascular respiratory nervous system digestive ear nose throat ophthalmology gynecology obstetrics urology blood hematology skin and endocrine. After the patient has identified the anatomic system of their complaint they are asked a series of System Screening Questions at state . For each anatomic system there are some symptoms or combinations of symptoms that if present would mandate immediate intervention such that any delay even to go any further through the menuing process could cause harm. For example if the patient has identified the cardiovascular system as the anatomic system in which his or her complaint lies i.e. chest pain the MDATA system will ask the cardiovascular system screening questions. For example the patient would be asked Do you have both pressure in your chest and shortness of breath If these symptoms are present together immediate intervention is necessary. With the thrombolytic agents that are available today time is critical in order to save myocardial cells. Just a few minutes can mean the difference between being able to resuscitate a patient or not.

Therefore at state the system determines if a serious medical condition exists. If so the system moves to state plays a message that advises the patient to seek immediate medical attention and ends the evaluation process at a terminal state . If it is determined at state that a serious medical condition does not exist the system proceeds to a complaint menu at state and recites a list of algorithms dealing with the problem that corresponds to the anatomic system selected. The patient then selects an algorithm from the list.

If the patient is not sure of the anatomic system the system attempts to identify the problem by requesting the cause. Cause refers to a cause for an illness or disease such as trauma infection allergy immune poisoning environmental vascular mental genetic endocrine metabolic and tumor. Once the patient has identified what they think is the cause of their problem e.g. trauma infection the MDATA system asks the Cause Screening Questions at state . These questions are asked to make sure that the patient is not suffering from an immediate life threatening problem. For example if infection were chosen as the cause the system would first rule out the possibility of epiglottis or meningitis before proceeding. Therefore at state the system determines if a serious medical condition exists. If so the system moves to state plays a message that advises the patient to seek immediate medical attention and ends the evaluation process at a terminal state . If it is determined at state that a serious medical condition does not exist the system proceeds to a complaint menu at state and recites a list of algorithms dealing with the problem that corresponds to the cause selected. The patient then selects an algorithm from the list.

Alphabetic groups lists the items in the anatomic system group and the cause group together in alphabetic order. Moving to state the system determines if the selected item is from the cause subgroup of the combined alphabetic groups. If so the system proceeds to the Cause Screening Questions at state . If not the system moves to the System Screening Questions at state .

Enter Catalog number state refers to the ability of the patient to select and enter an individual medical algorithm from a catalog of medical algorithms listed in the patient guide distributed to all patients. At the completion of state or the complaint has been identified and the computer proceeds to state wherein a series of initial problem screening questions are presented to the patient. There is a different set of problem screening questions for every complaint for which advice is offered.

For the purpose of this discussion Headache will be used as an example to describe how the system approaches the diagnosis of a problem and provides treatment recommendations. As with many problems there are some causes of headache that require immediate medical attention. Quite often when a problem is very serious any delay even to discuss it further can adversely affect the patient s outcome. The problem screening questions identify at a decision state the subset of patients whose headaches may require immediate medical care. If a serious medical condition exists the patient is advised to seek immediate medical attention at state . The computer then ends the evaluation process at state and returns to state in

By asking a question about the patient s level of consciousness a dilemma has been confronted. What does the MDATA system do about the patient whose problem itself prevents them from appropriately responding to questions or following advice 

There are some conditions that by their very nature may prevent patients from answering questions correctly. For this reason the MDATA system utilizes a mental status examination function . The mental status examination is a series of questions used to assess the patient s orientation. This function allows the MDATA system to assess the patent s ability to respond to questions and to follow advice. Although only shown in the mental status examination function is incorporated into the dialogue of any problem whose presentation could include an altered level of consciousness. Function will be further described in conjunction with .

The MDATA system will of course be accessed by patients in whom an altered level of consciousness is not expected based on the problem that the patient has. The system does anticipate the possibility of the patient having an altered level of consciousness in some problems e.g. when a patient consults the system for striking his or her head and invokes the mental status exam function . However an intoxicated patient calling for some other complaint e.g. a sprained ankle is one example where the patient may not be able to understand instructions from the system . For this reason the MDATA system also utilizes a semantic discrepancy evaluator routine SDER function . The SDER function provides information to the patient and then after a predetermined period of time asks the patient to repeat or select the information. The patient s answer is then evaluated within system . If discrepancies are determined the system automatically invokes the mental status examination function . In another embodiment the system asks the patient for some information in different ways at different times and then compares the patient s responses to determine if they are consistent. If not the system automatically invokes the mental status examination function . Although only shown in the SDER function is embedded throughout system and is randomly evoked by the computer . Function will be further described in conjunction with .

Continuing with the headache example at state the MDATA system asks the next problem screening question in order to help exclude the possibility of meningitis a very serious infection of the central nervous system.

The initial screening questions state and the problem screening questions state can usually be completed within a minute or so. Once the MDATA system has excluded the causes of headache that require immediate medical attention the system becomes a little less formal and more conversational in the subsequent states. The examples given of course do not represent all the initial or problem screening questions.

If no serious medical condition exists as determined at state the computer proceeds to a decision state wherein the system identifies those patients who are re entering the system from an earlier consultation. This occurs most frequently when the system needs to monitor a patient s symptom over time or if the system is initially unable to make a specific diagnosis and would like the patient to re enter the system again typically within a few hours. The system sets an internal re enter flag to identify the situation where a patient is calling again for the same complaint. If the flag is set at state the computer proceeds to state and branches to a re enter point in the evaluation process depending on which medical algorithm has been evoked. The computer moves via off page connector A to state to the appropriate re enter point.

If the re enter flag is not set as determined at state the computer moves via off page connector B to a decision state to determine if the consultation is being performed in Real mode or Pending mode. If not i.e. the consultation is in Information mode the computer proceeds to state to continue the evaluation process. If the consultation is in Real or Pending mode the computer calls a meta function wherein patients are subjected to several meta analyses. This concept will be explained in conjunction with but in general it refers to the system s ability to evaluate the patient s present problem in the context of their past use of the system. The Meta function matches various parameters against a predetermined meta threshold. When the MDATA system opens a patient s consultation history file in database it calculates how many times the patient has consulted the system for the same complaint. For each problem the MDATA system allows a specified number of system consultations per unit of time before it takes action. If the meta threshold is reached as determined at a decision state the MDATA system makes a recommendation based on this fact alone at state . For example let us assume that the threshold was set at five headaches in two months. If the patient consulted the MDATA system for headache more than four times in two months the threshold would be reached and the system would make an appropriate recommendation. The threshold of course is different for each complaint and may be modified by a set of sensitivity factors that will be described hereinbelow. Alternately the system uses a time density ratio TDR calculated by the meta function to determine if a recommendation should be given to the patient.

At the completion of state or if the meta threshold was not reached at state the computer proceeds to state to continue the evaluation process. State includes a medical algorithm as selected by the patient in states or . Although not necessarily a complete list types of medical algorithms include Headache Convulsion or Seizure Chest Pain Heatstroke Altered Level of Consciousness Tremor Dizziness Irregular Heartbeat Fainting Shortness of Breath Chest Injury Depression Head Injury Cough Croup High Blood Pressure Hyperventilation Numbness Wheezing Inhalation Injury and Strokes. In addition to meta and past medical history functionality at least some of the listed medical algorithms rely upon knowledge of age and or sex of the patient as provided in the presently described system at time of registration see and .

Depending on the medical algorithm and the exact patient condition one or more auxiliary functions may be called by state as follows the mental status examination function the SDER function a past medical history function a physical self examination function a patient medical condition function and a symptom severity analysis function . These functions will be described hereinbelow.

Returning to the headache example after the meta analyses function are completed the MDATA system assesses the severity of the patient s headache on a one to ten scale. The importance of this purely subjective quantization of the symptom s severity will become apparent later in this description.

Although the MDATA system s paradigm is fundamentally an algorithmic one the underlying logic of the diagnostic process for headache will be described. The MDATA system begins the diagnostic process for headache by referring to three lists stored internally in the computer .

The first list is a ranking of the most common causes of headache in the general population. The most common cause is ranked first the second most common is ranked second and so on. In other words the first list ranks all the causes of headache in the general population in decreasing frequency of occurrence.

The second list is a ranking of the various causes of headache according to the seriousness of the underlying cause. The more serious causes are positioned toward the top of the list the less serious toward the bottom. For example meningitis brain tumor and subarachnoid hemorrhage would be the top three causes on the second list.

The third list is quite similar to the second list. It ranks the causes of headache according to the rapidity with which intervention is necessary. The causes of headache that require immediate intervention such as meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage are toward the top. The problem screening questions state were developed from this list.

During the evaluation process the MDATA system asks the patient a series of diagnostic screening questions. From the answers to these questions along with any physical signs elicited from the patient from function under the direction of the MDATA system the system establishes the most likely cause of the patient s headache.

Based upon the answers to the diagnostic screening questions the MDATA system reorders the first list. The first list then becomes a list of the possible causes of headache in decreasing levels of probability in the patient seeking consultation. The first list is now patient specific. If the MDATA system concludes that migraine is the most likely cause of the patient s headache then migraine will now be ranked at the top of the first list.

The MDATA system is knowledgeable about the difference between classic common and all other variants of migraine but for this discussion the general term migraine will be used. After reordering the first list and placing migraine at the top the MDATA system then asks several questions related specifically to migraine headaches. These are called the migraine screening questions. The probability that the patient actually has a migraine headache is calculated from the answers to these questions. Each cause of headache has its own set of screening questions physical examination signs and if the patient has the MDATA system s Home Diagnostic and Treatment Kit appropriate laboratory tests.

After obtaining the answers to the migraine screening questions if the probability that the patient is suffering from a migraine headache does not reach an established threshold the next cause of headache on the reordered first list is considered and pursued as a diagnosis.

If the probability of having a migraine headache does reach the threshold the MDATA system asks the patient several more questions designed to confirm the presence of migraine given the fact that the system has already determined that it is the most likely diagnosis. These are called the migraine confirmation questions. Just as each cause of headache has a set of screening questions each cause of headache also has a set of confirmation questions.

From the answers to the migraine confirmation questions the MDATA system calculates the probability of confirmation of migraine. In Bayes terms which refer to the probability of certainty of a diagnosis this is called a conditional probability. 

If the probability of migraine headaches reaches threshold but the probability of confirmation of migraine does not reach threshold then as mentioned the system pursues the next diagnostic cause of headache on the patient specific list.

If the probability of the second cause of headache say cluster reaches threshold then the cluster confirmation questions are asked. If they reach threshold then again the serious causes of headache are excluded as a diagnosis.

The MDATA system stores the scores of all the screening and confirmation questions in what are called session memory variables that are installed in the symbol table. It is in part these scores that are then used to determine the probability of one diagnosis versus another.

For example if the answers to the cluster confirmation questions do not reach threshold then the scores of the screening and confirmation questions of migraine and cluster are compared to see which cause is the more probable.

Whichever has the higher score or exceeds the other by a predetermined threshold is then assumed to be the more probable cause. The list is if necessary again reordered. This time it becomes the final diagnostic list which is a list of differential diagnoses in decreasing levels of probability for this patient.

All of the headache scoring thresholds are modified or modulated by a series of sensitivity factors as are all aspects of the system in which scalar thresholds are used. The sensitivity factors are discussed hereinbelow in section XVIII. For example if it was found that a subset of patients in which the diagnosis of meningitis was not being made as early as it should be then the sensitivity factor modifying the temperature threshold could be decreased so that now a patient with a lower temperature would be instructed to seek an immediate evaluation.

Before discussing the results with the patient however the MDATA system must again rule out the serious causes of headache. The problem screening questions have already filtered out those patients who have a serious cause of headache such as meningitis that requires immediate medical intervention.

The MDATA system now proceeds to eliminate those causes of headache that although serious do not require immediate medical attention. For example although a brain tumor is a serious cause of headache it is not as immediately life threatening as meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage. To accomplish this task the MDATA system sequentially analyzes the serious causes of headache that are located at the top of the second list. The MDATA system again asks the patient the set of screening questions associated with each of the serious causes of headache. This time however the MDATA system makes sure that the probability of having any of the serious causes of headache is sufficiently low in order to exclude them from diagnostic consideration. Only after this is accomplished will the system discuss its conclusion and recommendations with the patient.

The discussion that the MDATA system would have with the migraine headache patient would include the following 

Even if the MDATA system cannot determine with sufficient certainty what is causing the headache it can still provide patients with valuable information and advice. For example the patient may be told the following 

 At this time the MDATA system is unable to pinpoint a particular cause of your headache with the degree of certainty required to make specific recommendations. The MDATA system however suggests a consultation with a neurologist. You can either call your family practitioner or internist and ask for a referral.

 While you are waiting to be seen by the neurologist there are many things that you can do in order to help the physician diagnose your headache. Many headache experts have found that a record of when their patients headaches occur and how bad they are is very helpful in finding both the cause of the headache as well as the best treatment.

 In order to assist you the MDATA system will send you a blank calendar on which you can record the time and severity of your headaches. In addition there is space for you to record what seems to bring on the headaches makes them worse or makes them better. The MDATA system will also send you a questionnaire to fill out and give to your doctor containing a list of questions asked by some of the world s leading headache experts when they are trying to arrive at a diagnosis. 

The MDATA system is able to customize the information given to patients to accommodate the individual needs of a sponsoring agency or group such as a Health Maintenance Organization HMO or a Managed Care Plan. For example if the system finds that the patient should see a physician the MDATA system can determine from a patient s medical record whether they have an established relationship with an appropriate specialist. If they do the specialist s name and phone number or a list of participating specialists for their HMO or Managed Care Plan and any specific instructions will be given to the patient with the recommendation to make an appointment within a specific time frame.

At the conclusion of state the system may or may not have a reasonably certain diagnosis available. For example the headache algorithm provides a diagnosis of migraine in response to a particular set of patient symptoms. In situations where the MDATA system cannot determine with sufficient certainty what is causing a particular problem no diagnosis or in a situation where a diagnosis is available but additional information is desirable e.g. to determine a trend a re enter flag may be set by the system . At a decision state the computer determines if re enter criteria are met for the current algorithm and patient situation. If so the computer sets the re enter flag at state for this problem so a subsequent telephone consultation by the patient will allow for additional information to be added to the patient record by the system in full knowledge of the previous call. This additional information may yield a better diagnosis.

If the re enter criteria were not met as determined at state the computer proceeds to a decision state to determine if the patient desires to hear treatment information for the current problem. If so the computer calls the treatment table process which will be described in conjunction with . If the patient does not wish to hear treatment information at this time the computer advances to a decision state to determine if the patient would like to investigate another complaint through the evaluation process . If so the computer moves via off page connector C to state on to repeat the process . However if the patient does not wish to pursue another complaint the computer returns at state to the top level flow .

Referring now to and the meta function defined in will be described. One of the many ways the MDATA system is qualitatively different from prior ways of providing medical advice is in its use of the meta function. As mentioned earlier meta refers to the system s ability to evaluate the patient s present problem in the context of his or her past use of the system. The meta function allows the system to make an inference based upon the number and frequency of previous patient consultations or medical complaints and the system s previous diagnostic assessments. Every patient who has previously used the MDATA system undergoes the meta analysis.

A set of meta function analyses involves the identification of trends in the patient s medical history. For example if a patient went to his or her doctor with a history of gradually worsening headaches either more painful more frequent or both the physician would consider this worsening trend in his or her management of the case. The MDATA system also does this.

The algorithm author passes input parameters to the meta function by using the keyword Meta followed by the input parameters enclosed in parentheses. The format for the meta function is Meta PS SS CS T T 

In pattern matching analysis the meta function compares the input strings with the record fields in the patient s consultation history database . The use of the wildcard character in the input string will cause the meta function to ignore the corresponding character position in the record field thereby enabling the meta function to examine only the fields of interest. By providing input strings that are either general or specific the fields of interest for analysis are selected. For example Meta NHDA T T will cause the meta function to only consider past consultations for the problem of headache regardless of the anatomic system and cause involved.

Through the use of a common syntax the meta process supports four types or modes of pattern matching analysis shown here through examples 

Here the meta function will find the number of complaints of headaches that occurred between Jun. 1 1993 and Dec. 31 1993.

Here the meta function will find the number of complaints involving the gastro intestinal system between Jun. 1 1993 and Dec. 31 1993. For example if a patient consulted the MDATA system once for abdominal pain once for vomiting and once for diarrhea but each on a different occasion the system would recognize that these are all problems involving the gastrointestinal tract.

Here the meta function will find the number of complaints that were found to be caused by bacterial infection between Jun. 1 1993 and Dec. 31 1993. The problems complaints caused by bacterial infection could be in different parts of the body.

Here the meta function will find the number of complaints of headache that were found to be caused by infection between Jun. 1 1993 and Dec. 31 1993.

If the pattern matching analysis finds at least three matching records in the patient s consultation history database then the meta function performs a time density analysis. Time density refers to the amount of time between each consultation. If the amount of time between consultations is getting shorter then the frequency of consultation suggests that the nature of the complaint is getting worse. Time density analysis reveals when a problem is getting better and when it is getting worse.

Time density analysis uses the meta records that matched the pattern matching criteria. The computer designates the most recent meta record n the next most recent is record n 1 and the second most recent is record n 2 . The time stamp of each meta record is examined and two time difference values X and Y are determined according to the formula time difference 21 time difference 1 

The meta function counts the number of complaints of headache between Jun. 1 1993 and Dec. 31 1993. If the number of complaints found MC is greater than or equal to 3 then the evaluation process branches to node otherwise it branches to node .

The meta function is invoked to count the number of diagnoses attributed to a cause of infection. If the infection caused diagnoses found have a time density ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 then the evaluation process branches to node otherwise it branches to node .

Referring again to the meta function initializes at state by popping the input parameters off the run time stack and storing them in local memory variables PS for problem string SS for anatomic system string CS for cause string Tfor the beginning date and Tfor the ending date. After the start state the computer moves to state and initializes the pattern match counter to zero.

The computer then moves to state wherein it begins the pattern matching analysis. The computer reads the first meta record in the patient s consultation history database and moves to a decision state wherein it examines the record s timestamp. If the timestamp falls within the time window established by the input parameters Tand T then the computer will move to state otherwise it moves to state . At state the computer compares the contents of the meta record problem field with the input string PS the meta record anatomic system field with the input string SS and the meta record cause field with the input string CS. If all these fields match the respective input strings then the computer moves to state wherein the match counter MC is incremented and then the computer moves to state . If there is any mismatch between a meta record field and its respective input string then the computer moves to state and does not increment MC.

At decision state the computer determines if there are more meta records to process. If so the computer moves to state wherein it reads the next record and then moves back to state to perform the time window determination. The meta function iterates through this pattern matching until all of the meta records have been read. When there are no more meta records to be processed the computer moves through off page connector A to a decision state on wherein a determination is made if the value of the match counter MC is greater than or equal to 3. If so then the computer moves to state wherein it begins the time density analysis.

At state the computer locates the three most recent meta records whose fields matched the input strings. The computer designates the most recent meta record n the next most recent is record n 1 and the second most recent is record n 2 . The computer then moves to state wherein it calculates X the time difference between the timestamps of records n 2 and n 1 and Y the time difference between records n 1 and n. The computer then moves to state wherein it calculates the time density ratio TDR as the time X divided by time Y.

If the computer determined at state that there were less than three matches then it would move to state wherein it sets the value of the time density ratio TDR to 0.0 which indicates that the time density analysis could not be performed. At the completion of establishing the value of TDR at either state or the computer moves to terminal state wherein the meta process terminates returns the match counter MC and the time density ratio TDR and returns control to the evaluation process .

The interaction of the meta analyses for cause and for anatomic system can be conceptualized by means of a simple geometric metaphor. Consider a two dimensional array in which the causes of disease trauma infection allergy immune and so forth are placed on the Y axis or ordinate and the anatomic systems of the body cardiac respiratory nervous system and so forth are placed on the X axis or abscissa. Disease then can be represented by or is produced at the intersection of the lines drawn from the applicable cause and the anatomic system.

As a very simple illustration consider the two dimensional array shown in Table 3 . The array of Table 3 shows an infection in the central nervous system represented at the intersection of the cause of disease infection and the anatomic system involved the nervous system .

Of course each cause of disease can be further divided into subcauses. For example infection would be broken down or subdivided into bacterial and viral and bacterial would be further broken down into gram positive and gram negative and gram positive would be further yet broken down into streptococcus and so on. The anatomic systems could be broken down in a similar way.

As a patient uses the system and as the meta analyses for cause and for anatomic system attribute causes to disease processes and record the anatomic systems involved a three dimensional cube a meta cube is produced composed of these stacked two dimensional arrays. The Z axis coordinate of each layer is the time of the patient s consultation obtained from the system clock i.e. the moment that the actual intersection of the cause and anatomic system occurs indicating the diagnosis .

The meta cube then represents a summation of the patient s interaction with the system through time. Although much of the patient s past history is stored using ICD 9 CM codes as well as conventional text strings in fields of the patient s medical record the meta cube technique allows very useful analyses to be done.

Using the same modeling metaphor the Z axis coordinate can be used to represent the practice of medicine. Here the Z coordinate is again time but in this representation time refers to a spectrum of ages from pediatrics to geriatrics. Thus each coronal plane represents specialties by time e.g. pediatrics adolescent medicine adult geriatric. A vertical plane describes a specialty by anatomic site such as neurology or cardiology while a horizontal plane describes a specialty which practice is bounded subsumed by on cause such as oncology or infectious disease. To further this metaphor the rapidity with which intervention is necessary could be a fourth dimension of the model and the frequency of an occurrence of a disease is the fifth dimension. Ethical and moral responsibility could be a sixth dimension of the model.

The MDATA system uses a neural net emulator program to determine if patterns produced by patients as they traverse down the nodes creating node tracks of the algorithms in the course of a consultation may be early predictors of disease. Somewhat like the meta cube the node tracks can be superimposed rather than stacked upon one another to create a two dimensional array. This time however the pattern produced represents the sum of the patient s previous consultations. In the MDATA system this is called a node track traverse analysis. 

For example the MDATA system may discover that the pattern that is produced when a patient consults the system at different times for episodes of diarrhea cough and oral candidiasis may be predictive of AIDS. Or that the pattern produced when a patient consults the system for increased frequency of urination and weight loss may be predictive of diabetes mellitus.

Referring to and the mental status examination function defined in will be described. The mental status examination is a series of questions used to assess the patient s orientation that allows the system to determine the patient s ability to respond to questions and to follow advice. The examination is automatically incorporated into the dialogue of any problem whose presentation could include an altered level of consciousness. If an operator or nurse monitoring a telephone consultation at any time feels there may be a problem with the caller s ability to understand or respond to questions the mental status examination may also be manually invoked.

If the MDATA system determines that the patient is not sufficiently oriented based on the results of the mental status examination the system will ask to speak to someone other than the patient. If no one else is available the MDATA system can contact the emergency medical services system in the patient s area if the system knows the patient s present geographic position.

Beginning at a start state of the computer initializes the value of a variable Score to be zero. Moving to state the computer asks the patient Question 1. In the presently preferred embodiment the question is what day of the week is it If the person answers the question correctly as determined by a decision state the computer increments the value of Score by one. After Score is incremented or if the patient did not answer the first question correctly the computer moves to state wherein the computer asks the patient Question 2. In the presently preferred embodiment the question is what month of the year is it If the person answers the question correctly as determined by a decision state the computer increments the value of Score by one. After Score is incremented or if the patient did not answer the second question correctly the computer moves to state wherein the computer asks the patient Question 3. In the presently preferred embodiment the question is who is the President of the United States If the person answers the question correctly as determined by a decision state the computer increments the value of Score by one. After Score is incremented at state or if the patient did not answer the third question correctly the computer moves through off page connector A to a decision state on

At decision state the computer compares the score to the mental status exam threshold at a decision state . If the score meets or exceeds the threshold then the mental status exam returns to the evaluation process at state and the diagnostic evaluation continues. If the score does not reach or exceed the threshold value the computer moves to state wherein the operating mode flag is set to Pending. The MDATA system will then ask at a decision state if someone else is available to continue the consultation. If no one else is available any new information gathered up to this point in the session is saved to Pending file at state and then at state the telephone call with the patient is transferred to a medical staff person. If someone else is available as determined at state and is able and willing to continue the evaluation process of the patient as determined at state the computer asks the person if he or she is a registered assistant at state . If the person responds yes the computer invokes the assistant login process at start state on . If the person is not a registered assistant the computer invokes the assistant registration process at start state on . After assistant registration or login the computer moves to terminal state wherein the mental status examination process terminates and the evaluation process resumes. At the end of the evaluation process any new information gathered during the session will be written to the patient s past medical history file at state or to pending file at state on depending on whether the session continued in real or pending mode. In the presently preferred embodiment the value of Score could be zero one two or three. Of course in other embodiments different questions to be asked of the patient may be utilized in the mental status exam function .

Referring to the semantic discrepancy evaluator routine SDER defined in will be described. The SDER uses one or more questions that ask for the same information at different times and in other embodiments in different ways. The answers given by the patient are then compared within the system to help determine the mental status of the patient.

Beginning at a start state the computer moves to state and recites a message to the patient. In the presently preferred embodiment the message is remember this three digit number. NUMBER where the computer generates a random three digit number i.e. in the range 100 to 999 inclusive as NUMBER which is kept in a session memory variable.

Then after a predetermined time interval at state the computer moves to state and recites a request of the patient. In the presently preferred embodiment the request is please tell me the three digit number. The computer then compares the number given by the patient in response to state against the NUMBER kept in the memory variable at a decision state . If the numbers match the computer returns at state with a status of pass to the evaluation process . If the numbers do not match the computer returns at state with a status of fail to the evaluation process. In the presently preferred embodiment if the return status of the SDER is fail the evaluation process automatically invokes the mental status examination function .

Referring to the Past Medical History Routine PMHR defined in will be described. The contents of a patient s past medical history file which is part of the PMH database are loaded to the symbol table when the patient logs in to the system . During the evaluation process a TEST is performed by the computer before a particular medical algorithm is initiated to verify that necessary items are present in the symbol table. The effect of a negative TEST result is that the system prompts the patient to provide the missing past medical history information via the PMHR .

The PMHR uses an input parameter condition label L as indicated at State . The Condition label is unique e.g. PMHRLTB1 corresponds to the first PMH object tested in the croup RLTB algorithm diagnosis for croup in children. The label is passed so that PMHR knows what questions to ask. The ability of the system to ask a past medical history question in the middle of the evaluation process is a feature that saves the patient from having to answer the entire PMH questionnaire during the registration process. The Boolean result or scalar value is stored in the symbol table under this label PMHRLTB1 and the algorithm can use it in decision making e.g. If PMHRLTB1 True Then 4310 Else 4320.

Beginning at a start state the computer moves to state and prompts the patient for the missing medical condition data. Moving to state the computer repeats the information provided at state and asks the patient if the repeated information is correct. Moving to a decision state the patient responds by indicating whether the repeated information is correct. If the data is not correct the computer proceeds to state to determine if the patient would like to attempt the data entry step again. If so the computer loops back to state and prompts the patient for the data again. If not the computer returns at state to the evaluation process .

If the newly entered data is correct as determined at state the computer advances to state and installs the condition label L and the data value in the symbol table for the patient. The computer then returns at state to the evaluation process .

Referring to the Physical Self Examination function defined in will be described. A physical examination can actually be done by the patient under the direction of the MDATA system . The MDATA system is designed to function primarily based upon responses to carefully crafted questions i.e. history and physical findings elicited from the patient. There are times however when the addition of certain laboratory tests can increase the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as help determine the appropriate treatment recommendations. For this reason a MDATA system Home Diagnostic and Treatment Kit is available for use by patients. If the patient has the Home Diagnostic and Treatment Kit including visual field cards Snelling chart and possibly the MDATA system s tele stethoscope to assess intracranial or carotid bruits this information will be used in the diagnostic process as well.

The MDATA system is also able to play tones of different frequencies and intensities to emulate audiometric testing for hearing acuity. This allows for example the MDATA system to detect the unilateral decrease in hearing caused by an acoustic neuroma.

Beginning at a start state the computer branches to one or more physical self examination procedures depending on the current problem and what equipment if any is available for use by the patient. These procedures include home diagnostic tests vital signs observable physical signs clinical sound recording and tele stethoscope .

A variety of home diagnostic tests are available for use by the patient. New advances in biotechnology including a new generation of urine dipsticks such as a Multistix 8 SG produced by Ames and monoclonal antibody tests such as ICON STREP B produced by Hybritech allow an entire spectrum of laboratory tests to be performed at home by the patient under the direction of the MDATA system. For example urine dipsticks can be used to check for blood nitrites leukocytes or leukocyte esterase indicating cystitis or a bladder infection.

In order to use much of the monoclonal antibody technology however a small amount of blood must be obtained by using a fingertip lancet. This is already successfully being done by diabetics at home who use a glucometer to measure their blood sugar after pricking their finger to get a small sample of blood.

The MDATA system Home Diagnostic and Treatment Kit also contains equipment to allow the patient or someone else to measure the patient s vital signs . A blood pressure cuff and thermometer are included with instructions for their use as well as instructions to measure pulse and respiratory rate.

The patient may be directed by the system to observe various physical signs . For example a headache patient will be asked to palpate their temporal artery area and to look at themselves in the mirror to identify the ptosis and tearing of a cluster headache or to identify the steamy cornea that may occur with acute narrow angle glaucoma.

As an example of how the MDATA system Home diagnostic and Treatment Kit could be helpful consider a woman who using the MDATA system s urine pregnancy test based on ICON II HCG ImmunoConcentration Assay produced by Hybritech finds out that she is pregnant. This is her first pregnancy. Later when consulting the system for headache a urine dipstick indicates protein in her urine and the measurement of her vital signs shows a significant rise in her blood pressure. This is a classic presentation of preeclampsia.

Instead of going to a doctor s office patients could also use the MDATA system s Home Diagnostic and Treatment Kit to collect samples at home and then send them to a designated lab for analysis as needed. This saves time for the patient and is especially useful if the patient has difficulty in traveling. Costs should also be minimized in this type of laboratory analysis.

The MDATA system records clinically relevant sounds of a patient such as the cough of bronchitis the seal bark cough of croup or the inspiratory stridor of epiglottis. These sounds are digitized and stored in the patient s medical record. Then using the re enter feature of the system the system can monitor for example a patient s cough over time to be sure that the cough is resolving as it should.

The general concept of recording and analyzing a cough is disclosed in the article C. William Thorpe et al. published in 1991. The cough sound analysis system describes the filtering amplification recording and software processing of a cough sound. The MDATA system uses the telephone handset microphone in conjunction with an amplifier to procure the clinical sounds. These sounds are then transmitted to the system where they are filtered digitized using VP board and recorded to a file in the patient medical history database on the hard drive .

The MDATA system is building a library of clinical sounds that allows patterns or profiles to be developed that relate the wave form of the clinical sound to the probability of a particular diagnosis. For example the MDATA system could compare the cough of a patient to the sound library to see if the cough of the patient is similar to those that eventually have been diagnosed as lung cancer.

In addition the patient s record of the pronunciation of his or her name may be periodically recorded and compared to previous recordings. This allows the MDATA system to potentially detect and evaluate the hoarseness that could be produced by a nodule on the patient s vocal cords.

A tele stethoscope is a device that allows the sounds a physician would hear through a stethoscope to be transmitted over the telephone. The tele stethoscope is functionally similar to that described in the 1992 Arthur D. Little report entitled Telecommunications Can It Help Solve America s Health Care Problems . The tele stethoscope permits the MDATA system to greatly expand the spectrum of its sound analyses to include heart murmurs the bruits of intracranial aneurysms breathing sounds like the wheezes of asthma and the rales of congestive heart failure or even the bowel sounds of an intestinal obstruction.

There is more information in clinical sounds than can be represented by a two dimensional pattern matching model. Transforms e.g. Fourier are used to shift different aspects of sounds into domains that can be quantified. The sounds are then pattern matched using an n dimensional array. Consider a simple two dimensional array where time is represented on the X coordinate and amplitude is measured on the Y coordinate. For example a cough may be recorded at two times several days apart. In this example the computer superimposes the waveform from one cough upon the other cough. The non overlapping parts of the pattern both above and below represent the difference in the domain being measured between the two sounds. The area under these two curves is integrated to obtain the area. The sum of the areas of the two curves represents the difference between the two sounds in the domain being measured. The resultant area is then subjected to one or more sensitivity factors which are discussed hereinbelow. Hence the more sensitive the system the sooner it makes a match.

In a similar way a sound pattern may be considered with time on the X coordinate and frequency on the Y coordinate. The same methodology is used to quantify the differences between the two curves. Thus in a similar way all aspects of sound can be measured.

In this pattern matching scheme different weights are given to the different aspects of the sound depending upon which clinical sound is measured. In most sounds the amplitude and frequency are the most important aspects. The weight or the relative importance of an aspect is different for each of various clinical sounds such as heart murmurs bruits wheezes coughs stridor and so forth.

When value s from any of the procedures are procured by the system the computer moves to state recites the value and requests the patient to confirm the value. If the patient indicates that the value is correct as determined at a decision state the computer proceeds to state and installs the value into the symbol table associated with the current patient. If the value is not correct as determined at decision state the computer proceeds to state to determine if the patient would like to try providing the value again. If so the computer loops back to the beginning of the function . If the patient does not wish to try again as determined at state or if state is completed the computer returns at state to the evaluation process .

Referring to the Patient Medical Condition Routine defined in will be described. In the course of executing a particular medical algorithm in the evaluation process as shown at state the computer may request additional medical condition information of the patient. This information reflects the current condition of the patient which is in contrast to the information requested by the past medical history routine for past history information. The states through of the routine are essentially the same as states through of routine except that in routine the condition label L denotes a value for which a past medical history question is to be asked during the evaluation process while in routine the condition label denotes a new value desired by the algorithm. Therefore states are not further described herein.

Referring now to and the symptom severity analysis function defined in will be described. A review and further description of the re enter feature which is associated with symptom severity analysis is also provided here.

An important feature of the MDATA system is its ability to follow or monitor a patient over time. If the MDATA system is in the process of diagnosing a patient s complaint but is not certain what action should be taken states of system may ask the patient to re enter the system at a designated time usually within a few hours.

When the patient calls the MDATA system at the designated time the system takes the patient through the initial problem screening questions state of in order to exclude those problems that require immediate medical attention. The system detects that the patient is a re enter case state of and then determines the re entry point in the evaluation process based upon the patient s previous interaction with the system state of . For example if the MDATA system established a diagnosis of migraine that is if both the probability of migraine and the probability of confirmation of migraine reached threshold values the patient would not repeat the diagnostic process which is the usual case.

Occasionally however a patient for whom a diagnosis has not been established will be asked to re enter the system . This patient is again asked the diagnostic screening questions in addition to the initial screening questions state of and problem screening questions state of . If the MDATA system is not able to establish a diagnosis for a re enter patient he or she is referred to a physician for further evaluation.

In addition to the re enter feature the MDATA system has the capability to call patients back in order to monitor their progress. The same trending methodologies are used regardless of who initiates the call i.e. the system or the patient. Using this capability the MDATA system can provide regular or periodic monitoring of elderly patients in their homes as well as inform patients when a new therapy becomes available.

Many problems for which the MDATA system offers advice have absolute thresholds for the initial quantization of the severity of a symptom. For example chest pain that is described by a patient as being 10 on a 10 scale of severity would reach the problem specific initial symptom severity threshold and would mandate a consultation with a physician.

Interestingly with headache an initial severity characterized by the patient as 10 on a 10 scale would not in itself necessarily require an immediate consultation with a physician. If in addition the headache came on suddenly and as was mentioned earlier was described as the worst headache of the patient s life the MDATA system would consider this to be suggestive enough of a subarachnoid hemorrhage to advise an immediate consultation with a physician.

Continuing in the headache example after a re enter patient with an established diagnosis is asked the initial and problem screening questions the MDATA system again assesses the severity of the patient s headache. Reassessing the severity of the headache by having the patient re enter the system establishes two points of reference. The system is now able to analyze any changes in the level of severity as well as calculate the rate of change in severity over time.

The symptom severity analysis function has a Number of Points N as an input parameter as indicated at state . Number of Points refers to the points of reference established during the initial consultation for a particular problem and during subsequent re enter consultation s . Beginning at a start state the computer determines the value of N i.e. the number of reference points at a decision state . If it is determined that N 2 the computer moves to state to compute the slope of a line connecting the two reference points using standard mathematical techniques. Proceeding to state a variable named Power is set to be one because only two reference points are used at state . The computer returns at state with output parameters Slope and Power as determined by function to the evaluation process .

Using the returned Slope and Power parameters in the evaluation process if the MDATA system determines that the severity of the headache for example is increasing too rapidly that is if a slope of the line connecting two points on a graph of the severity reaches a set threshold system will make an appropriate recommendation.

If the MDATA system finds that the severity of the headache is staying the same or is getting worse but is doing so at a relatively slow rate it may ask the patient to re enter the system a second time i.e. for a third consultation usually within a shorter period of time. The third consultation gives the MDATA system three points of reference from which to trend the severity of the headache. Thus when the function is called by the evaluation process the value of N is three as determined at state and the computer branches to state . At state the computer determines the slope and power of a line connecting the three reference points. The presently preferred embodiment uses the well known Runge Kutta method which is a numerical approximation technique for solving differential equations. Other embodiments may use other well known standard curve fitting functions at state .

If the system determines that yet one or more additional consultations i.e. beyond three consultations are desired e.g. to establish a trend with certainty it will again request the patient to re enter the system at a later time. In this situation the three most recent reference points are used in the calculation at state .

The system then performs a sequential symptom severity slope analysis to determine if the symptom is getting worse too rapidly as follows. The slopes of the lines connecting the first and second point the second and third point and then the first and third point are calculated. If any of these reach a problem specific threshold the appropriate recommendation is given.

If the sequential symptom severity slope analysis does not reveal the need to seek medical attention then the MDATA system in addition to calculating the rate of change in the severity of the symptom with respect to time the slope analysis now calculates the rate of change of the rapidity with which the headache is getting worse. This is the first derivative.

Table 4 illustrates this relationship. Time maps onto the X axis and the symptom s severity maps onto the Y axis. Note that a line connecting these three points forms a gently sloping straight line. The MDATA system using this data determines that although the symptom is getting worse it is doing so in an arithmetical or linear way. That is although the severity of the symptom is increasing the symptom s rate of change is not increasing.

In contrast a line connecting the three points on the graph of Table 5 forms a sharply upturned curve. The MDATA system using the data of Table 5 determines that not only is the symptom rapidly getting worse but more significantly the rate at which the symptom is getting worse is also increasing. In the MDATA system this analysis is termed an exponential symptom severity filter. All patients who re enter the system a second time are subjected to this analysis.

It is important to note that the severity of a problem e.g. a headache is not necessarily related to the seriousness of the underlying cause. The MDATA system is programmed such that when any symptom gets rapidly worse medical intervention is frequently advised as necessary. This concept is valid for many symptoms.

Returning to the symptom severity analysis function if the function is called with N 0 or N 1 the computer branches to state . At state the Slope and Power parameters are set to zero and the computer returns these parameters at state to the evaluation process . The values set at state essentially flag an error condition that is acted on by the evaluation process .

Referring to the Treatment Table process defined in will be described. The MDATA system is modularized in its approach to diagnosis and treatment. In medicine diagnosis simply means figuring out what is causing the problem and treatment refers to what action should be taken once the cause of the problem is known.

Diagnosis is composed of history physical examination imaging studies and laboratory tests. Again history is by far the most important factor in making the diagnosis. In fact in medical school students are taught that if they don t have a good idea of the diagnosis by the end of the history they are doing something wrong.

The treatment side of medicine is conceptually different from diagnosis in that while the basic principles of making the diagnosis remain the same treatment is continually changing. Treatment is fundamentally a look up table with the diagnosis age and sex on the left and the most current treatment on the right as shown in Table 6. Or treatment can be thought of like the cubbyholes or boxes of a post office. Each individual box holds the treatment for a given disease. The information given is age and sex specific. The contents of the box are constantly changing but the location of the box does not. For example what is thought to be the best antibiotic to treat meningitis in a two year old child could literally change from week to week as more antibiotics are developed and approved or more controlled studies are published.

The treatment table can be directly accessed by patients who already know their diagnosis. For example asthma patients can consult the system as often as they wish to see what the absolute latest treatment is for their condition. In fact links are maintained between the treatment table and the patient medical history files . In this way when a new treatment is introduced for any of the ICD 9 CM codes listed in the MDATA system patients can be contacted and asked to either call the system back at their convenience or have the MDATA system fax or mail the information to them. The MDATA system can also notify patients doctors when a new treatment is identified.

The concept of using a table is also helpful with regard to two aspects of the diagnostic process that often do change the imaging modality of choice like X ray Computerized Tomography CT Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI and the laboratory test s of choice. Therefore the MDATA system also maintains a table for imaging modality of choice as well as laboratory test s of choice in the work up or diagnosis of a particular complaint. By modularizing these aspects of the diagnosis as new imaging techniques like Positron Emission Tomography PET scanning and new laboratory tests like recombinant DNA technology are discovered only the tables have to be altered not the medical algorithms themselves.

The treatment table will be further described in a general way as process in . The treatment table process begins at start state and proceeds to state wherein the computer prompts the caller to choose a treatment selection method 

The first selection method entails the use of the menu driven treatment selection process which will be described hereinbelow in conjunction with . The second selection method at state uses a treatment table catalog message number. This catalog is part of the patient information package a section of which appears in Table 7. The treatment table catalog is organized by anatomic area and diagnosis and when applicable by age and gender. After the patient selects a catalog number the computer stores the selection in a memory variable M . As an alternate selection method the system allows the patient to directly enter the ICD 9 CM code for their problem. In this case the computer will look up the ICD 9 CM code in an internal cross reference table to identify the catalog number and set the memory variable M to this catalog number.

Once the value of the memory variable M is established by process or state the computer moves to state and plays treatment message M to the patient. At the conclusion of treatment message playback the computer moves to a decision state .

At state the computer checks for existence of society message M . The society message category contains information about organizations that assist patients with a particular disease. If the society message M does not exist the computer moves to a decision state . Otherwise the computer will move to state wherein it plays society message M to the patient. At the end of the society message M the computer moves to state .

At state the computer checks for the existence of an over the counter OTC message M . The OTC message category contains information about generally available over the counter medications and home treatment for a particular diagnosis. If the OTC message M does not exist the computer moves to state . Otherwise the computer moves to state wherein it play OTC message M to the patient. At the end of the OTC message M the computer moves to state .

At state the computer plays a terminal menu to the patient which allows the patient to either select another treatment or to exit from the treatment table process . If the patient wishes to hear another treatment message the computer moves back to the treatment selection method menu state . If the patient wishes to exit the treatment table process the system moves to state wherein the treatment table process terminates and returns to the top level flow at state .

An example of the treatment society and OTC messages for epilepsy are given in Table 8. Note that since the OTC message is empty the computer would skip over the OTC message playback and proceed directly to the terminal menu.

Referring now to the menu drive treatment selection process defined in will be described. The menu driven treatment selection process begins with start state and proceeds to state wherein the computer recites an area menu to the patient and requests selection of one area. The complete menu is not shown in state . The areas are arranged by anatomic system. For example if a patient has epilepsy the patient can simply select this from the anatomic system menu for the neurological system.

Based on the patient s selection the computer branches to a selection area menu state such as neurological area menu state wherein the computer recites a list of diagnoses to the patient and requests selection of a diagnosis. In some cases the diagnosis is further subdivided by gender age or both gender and age. At state for example for a diagnosis of meningitis the computer would prompt the patient to select from a secondary menu between a treatment for a child two years old or younger and a treatment for somebody over two years old. Then based on the patient s selection the computer sets a memory variable M to the value of the selected diagnosis message number at state or . State is another example secondary level menu which has four choices based on gender and age. These four choices are associated with four states wherein the computer sets the memory variable M to the value of the diagnosis message number that was selected at state . After the catalog number has been stored in memory variable M the computer moves to return state wherein the menu driven treatment selection process terminates and returns control to the treatment table process .

Area menu and AreaN menu are indicative of menus similar to menu but for different anatomic systems. Menu and may have secondary menus similar to menus and under menu . Then states and are indicative of the computer setting memory variable M to the value of the diagnosis message number selected from the parent menu or respectively.

As mentioned earlier one of the purposes of the MDATA system is to bring together highly qualified medical experts encode their knowledge in a central location and make this information available to everyone.

Although the issue of accessibility has been discussed several times it is important to understand its significance. Accessibility in the MDATA system refers both to the way in which the medical information can be retrieved from the system by non medically trained personnel as well as to the need for people everywhere to easily and promptly obtain medical information. By using the already established worldwide telecommunications network the MDATA system can provide universal and nearly instantaneous access to high quality 100 consistent medical advice.

In the MDATA system the concepts of modularity and modifiability are inextricably intertwined. Modularity is the key to the MDATA system s ability to provide patients with the most current medical information available. The MDATA system s modular design and object oriented techniques allow the individual components of the system to be modified or updated without generating a ripple effect on other information in the system .

In contrast the print media suffers from an inability to quickly adapt to changing information. Once a book or journal is published it cannot be modified until its next publishing date. The MDATA system however can be modified within hours of a new discovery in medicine. Easy modifiability is another way in which the MDATA system is qualitatively different from previously published algorithms.

Once the medical algorithms for the MDATA system are written and programmed they can then be continuously updated and refined as advances in medicine are made. Unfortunately physicians today are simply not able to keep up with the explosion of new medical information and technology. This ability to nearly instantaneously modify the MDATA system is a powerful feature of the system.

It is presently possible for a computer to search the world s medical literature daily. Any articles pertaining to a particular topic can automatically be requested and the information used to update the system.

In addition the MDATA system is currently using optical character recognition technology to digitize its medical database. Then using indexing techniques the MDATA system is able to search for and retrieve any information desired. For example the system can search for the character string headache and retrieve any amount of surrounding text or graphic information. This information is then collected collated printed and referred to the physician s maintaining the headache algorithm. This process will become easier as more of the world s medical literature is digitized.

Another way in which the MDATA system is modifiable is in its use of global sensitivity selectivity factors. As with every decision there is always a balance to be achieved between risk and benefit and so with the MDATA system . One of the questions the MDATA system tries to answer is whether the patient needs to be seen immediately by a physician. This leads to this discussion about sensitivity and selectivity.

Sensitivity and selectivity are statistical terms that refer to how accurately a decision can be made. In this case sensitivity refers to the number of patients which the MDATA system did not think needed to be seen by a physician but that actually did.

If the program were to be so sensitive that no disease process that eventually required meaningful physician intervention would be treated at home no false negatives then every single complaint would necessitate a visit to the doctor which is a useless system. On the other hand too selective a system no false positives i.e. no unnecessary visits to the doctor s office would necessitate that an attempt be made at home treatment for every complaint which is a useless and dangerous system.

So again a balance must be reached between these two ends of the spectrum. To achieve this the sensitivity selectivity ratio of the entire MDATA system can be changed by setting or tuning a plurality of sensitivity factors. These sensitivity factors affect the following functions meta thresholds reenter horizon threshold frequency of call back symptom severity filters sequential slope filters exponential symptom severity filters and probabilities of diagnoses in the treatment table. In addition as in the headache example the scoring of the screening questions already weighted is modulated or modified by the sensitivity factors.

Experience from the regionalization of trauma centers in this country shows an interesting trend over time with respect to sensitivity and selectivity. It has been shown that the inverse relationship between sensitivity and selectivity when plotted over time yields a sinusoidal wave form in which the amplitude of the wave form gradually decreases with time as the system is fined tuned as shown in Table 9 . The MDATA system s sensitivity factors are designed to do just that i.e. fine tune the system over time to find the right balance between sensitivity and selectivity.

In addition to the use of global factors the MDATA system maintains what are termed emergency filter response sets. When a patient replies yes to any of the problem screening questions the recommendation or message that follows is called an emergency filter response or EFR. The EFR sets are modularized so that the system can customize the message that the patient hears. This allows the system to match the EFR sets to the desired level of sensitivity or selectivity as well as provide information specific to an HMO or Managed Care Plan.

Initially the sensitivity factors have a value of 1.0. The sensitivity factor s value is usually inversely proportional to sensitivity i.e. if the value is decreased sensitivity increases.

The sensitivity factors are applied to the threshold constant value in the relational expression component of an IF Then or If Then Else statement of a medical algorithm. For example let s assume that the system is in the meningitis algorithm and that a temperature greater than 102 degrees will trigger a recommendation to go to a hospital. An example of a threshold calculation without sensitivity factors follows If temp 102 then X else Y where X denotes the recommendation to go to the hospital and Y denotes a different branch point. Following is the same example but including sensitivity factors If temp 102 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9 S10 then X else Y

The use of the sensitivity factors permits anticipation of change. Tuning the initial product of the sensitivity factors from 1.00 to 0.95 would decrease the temperature at which the system recommends a trip to the hospital. Each threshold calculation or other use of the sensitivity factors may use any number of e.g. two factors and any combination of the factors. Additionally any combination of factors may be modified from the initial 1.0 value in any particular threshold calculation.

Age criteria is also modified by use of the sensitivity factors. For example If Age 45 S S then X else Y.

There are four main types of video imaging static black and white static color video black and white and video color. Each of these main types is now discussed.

Images as basic as static black and white images can provide useful information to the system . Static black and white imaging is used with neural net pattern matching. This process permits analyzing for example facial features to aid in the detection of certain diseases such as the characteristic facies of Cushing s syndrome or the exopthalmos of Graves disease.

Color static imaging allows color frequency analysis to detect diseases that are not as readily detected with static black and white imaging such as cyanosis of respiratory failure or the scleral icterus of hepatitis. Color thus provides an incremental benefit in the level of disease detection.

Real time black and white video imaging allows for the evaluation of physical signs such as pupillary responses extra ocular muscle function lid lag and nystagmus. Cranial nerve function can be remotely evaluated along with for example the distinction between central and peripheral VII nerve function.

Color video imaging especially using fiber optics adds much more capability in the evaluation of a patient s condition. For example color video imaging is very useful in evaluating capillary refill or monitoring the response of a patient with cyanosis to supplemental oxygen. Another embodiment of the system may employ inexpensive laser sources to perform real time holographic imaging.

It is rare when the humanitarian and entrepreneurial interests of a venture overlap. The confluence of purpose that exists in the MDATA system is striking. It is a win win proposition from every perspective.

Not only will the MDATA system substantially reduce the overwhelming costs of our current health care system but for the first time in history every person can have access to high quality 100 consistent and affordable medical advice and information. No matter from what perspective one views the MDATA system its benefits are substantial.

The health care consumer obviously gains the most. Now whenever he or she has a medical problem or any member of their family an immediate consultation can be obtained. The knowledge that the best health care information and medical advice is only a telephone call away can assuage the anxiety of everyone from new mothers to elderly patients confined to their homes.

By endorsing the MDATA system federal state and local governments could discharge their obligation to provide a universal and affordable level of health care for all of their citizens. In addition the MDATA system helps care for patients who cannot pay thus relieving primary care physicians of the necessity to provide care without reimbursement. For the first time Health Maintenance Organizations and Managed Care Plans will be able to effectively screen patients by telephone in order to ensure that patients are best matched with the services they need.

Specialists can use their talents not on the repetition of familiar rituals but will be free to concentrate on those more challenging problems that cannot easily be resolved by the MDATA system . They will also benefit from an increased number of patient referrals as well as having a well constructed patient history when a consultation is sought.

Physicians themselves can access the MDATA system in order to stay informed about new information and technological advances in the medical field. This is particularly true with the treatment imaging and laboratory test databases.

Medical information is a continually renewable resource because it is not consumed in its dissemination. The opportunity exists through the MDATA system for the United States to provide much needed medical information to the world and at the same time bring capital into this country. In the process this country could maintain its leadership in innovation technology and software development.

The United States and the world are facing a health care crisis so monumental that it is difficult to comprehend. There are diseases that threaten our very survival as a species. All of us know the apprehension and bewilderment we feel when an illness strikes. When this occurs we need answers to specific medical questions answers that are absolutely up to date instantly available and affordable.

The key is information information about prevention early detection of disease and about its most efficient treatment. The MDATA system can provide this information through the simple use of the telephone to nearly every inhabitant of the planet. In addition the MDATA system converts and explains complicated medical terminology and concepts into language easily understood by everyone.

People do not have to be ill to consult the MDATA system just curious. Patients do not have to schedule appointments they can simply pick up the telephone. Although many patients will later be seen by a physician the MDATA system can provide immediate help for everyone. The MDATA system at once establishes egalitarian access to health care information. Although many patients in this country receive state of the art medical care there is a large segment of the population that is deprived of one the most basic health care and medical information. The MDATA system begins to close this enormous gap.

The MDATA system begins to effect a restructuring of the health care delivery system in which both health care consumers and providers participate in the improvement of the system itself. The MDATA system and its patients will be in partnership to provide the most current economical and concise treatment available. The upside potential is unlimited. Whether one believes health care is a right or a privilege there can be no doubt that it is fundamentally necessary. Whether one believes we have a civic responsibility or a moral obligation to care for one another it must be done. The fundamental simplicity of the structure of the MDATA system belies its power as a highly useful tool in the delivery of health care.

A second embodiment of the MDATA system entails a major shift of how the questions and responses are delivered to the patient. Rather than the use of a telephone the voice processing and voice response technology the system software is published via media such as floppy disks CD ROM or PCMCIA cards for use on a patient s personal computer. This second embodiment is referred to as the screen version or the Stand Alone SA MDATA system. The computer could be for example a desktop computer a laptop or notebook computer or a handheld pen driven computer. The system questions are displayed on a display screen that is part of the computer or is connected to the computer. The patient uses a keyboard or a pointing writing device connected to the computer to respond to the questions. The patient files are maintained and updated within the computer or on removable storage devices. The diagnosis advice and treatments can be displayed on the screen and also printed in hardcopy form on a printer if available . New versions of the SA MDATA system are either mailed to subscribers are available via modem. These new versions may include updates of the treatment table for new treatments. Another embodiment of the SA MDATA system may include using specialized receiver devices that receive encoded FM signals on a demand basis when an event a new treatment triggers the device such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 030 948.

A unique and separate authoring language called File Output or FO was used to develop the medical algorithms used in the screen version embodiment of the system . Through the use of FO the contents of text files are presented online to users and then the users respond to questions and directions issued by the text files.

FO is designed as a typical generalized authoring language in which commands are embedded into text files herein called FO files to perform specific screen and keyboard functions. FO files are in effect programs written in the FO language that communicate via FO with the user online.

FO adds no text of its own. In fact FO does not need to know what text file content it is executing. The programmer or author of a FO file is in complete control of the text content and the sequence in which it is presented. Using the various commands described in the Authoring Language Syntax the author can display text format the screen ask the user questions input responses from the user select different text files for execution and generally control and direct the entire session.

This version of FO is intended as a development version that gives the user much freedom at the keyboard. The user can interrupt a presentation and edit the FO file being presented. The assumption here is that the user is in fact the author or an alpha tester charged with verifying and correcting file content.

A FO file is any standard sequential ASCII text file with variable length lines terminating with a Carriage Return ASCII 13 . Any line with a period in column one is treated as a command. A line without a leading period is treated as a print command.

The FO program processes a FO file by reading it one line at a time into memory. If the line is a text line it is printed and the next line is loaded. If the line is a command line the command is executed. If the command involves a wait on the user such as a .M command FO continues loading the FO file behind the scenes until it has been completely loaded. In this manner FO executes the FO file as it is loading it. Once loaded the FO file remains entirely in memory.

The system software for the screen version embodiment is written in Borland Turbo Pascal version 3.0. A second version of the system software for the screen version embodiment of the system is written in Microsoft G.W. Basic and is run in interpretive mode.

In yet other embodiments other databases files or algorithms can be used. The general system method and procedures would remain the same. For example a specialty field such as sports medicine could be added to the system.

The MDATA system described herein finds application in many environments and is readily adaptable for use therein. For example the system finds use in any application that is step oriented and can be algorithmically described. For example the system could give car diagnostic services over the phone to a caller. Then when the car is brought to a service facility for repairs treatment the caller will be informed and have a good idea of what the problem is and probable repairs will be. Accordingly the claims are to be interpreted to encompass these and other applications of the invention within their scope and are not to be limited to the embodiments described herein.

One of the main problems of the health care crisis is the limited access to health care information when it is needed. The MDATA system provides up to date medical information and advice that is instantly available twenty four hours a day. The advice that is given is 100 consistent.

The quality of the advice is much better if a physician can stop research and anticipate all possible causes of a problem and then systematically go about dealing with all of these possible causes. In medical practice a physician just does this from memory.

No humans are necessary to actually give the medical advice. The MDATA system is automated which helps to bring down the cost of health care.

An exact record of the questions asked and the answers given is stored in the patient s database. The MDATA system time and date stamps the responses to the questions as transaction records so that an exact reconstruction of the patient s interview s can be generated for use by a physician or other health care professional. The system also keeps a record of what version of an algorithm has been consulted as well as the sensitivity factor set for that consultation. At the conclusion of the interaction the MDATA system can tell the patient how long the consultation has taken and what charges have been incurred if any.

When possible the MDATA system takes into account the past medical history of the patient especially those pieces of information learned from past consultations with the MDATA system before advice is given. In addition the advice given is different depending upon the age and sex of the patient. The meta functions provide another advantage by allowing the MDATA system to evaluate a problem in the context of the patient s prior consultations with the system.

While the above detailed description has shown described and pointed out the fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to various embodiments it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the device illustrated may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.
