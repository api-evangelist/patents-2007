The present disclosure relates generally to semiconductor devices and more particularly to non volatile static random access memory SRAM .

Static Random Access Memory SRAM arrays occupy a large fraction of the chip area in many of today s memory designs. As memory will continue to consume a large fraction of many future designs scaling of memory density involves continuing to track the scaling trends of logic. With aggressive scaling of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors MOSFETs leakage currents are increasing with each circuit node.

These leakage currents consume a significant amount of power. One approach to reduce leakage currents MOSFET circuitry includes powering down portions of the MOSFET chip circuitry when not in use. However this approach cannot be applied in certain memory arrays e.g. an SRAM array without losing the stored contents of the memory.

Methods devices and systems for a non volatile static random access memory SRAM are provided. One method embodiment for operating the SRAM includes transferring data from a pair of static storage nodes of the SRAM to a pair of non volatile storage nodes when the SRAM is placed in a standby mode. The method further includes transferring data from the pair of non volatile storage nodes to the pair of static storage nodes when the SRAM exits the standby mode.

In one or more embodiments an SRAM includes a cross coupled pair of inverters. Each inverter includes a p type pull up transistor and an n type pull down transistor coupled to a first storage node wherein gates of each inverter in the pair are coupled to the first storage node of the other inverter. Each inverter in the SRAM includes a second storage node coupled to the first storage node. In one or more embodiments the first storage node is a static storage node and the second storage node is a non volatile storage node. In one or more embodiments the second storage node comprises a two terminal magnetic tunnel junction MTJ device wherein the MJT device includes a first ferromagnetic layer and a second ferromagnetic layer separate by a dielectric. In one or more embodiments the first ferromagnetic layer is coupled to the first storage node and is unpinned such that a polarization of an associated spin value can rotate. The second ferromagnetic layer is in contact with an anti ferromagnetic layer coupled to a control line and is pinned such that a polarization of an associated spin value is fixed in one direction.

In the following detailed description of the present disclosure reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration how one or more embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those of ordinary skill in the art to practice the embodiments of this disclosure and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that process electrical and or structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

The SRAM cell includes a second inverter including a p channel PMOS pull up transistor Tpu and an n channel NMOS pull down transistor Tpd coupled at the other of the pair of first storage nodes e.g. formed between their drain regions. The storage node is further coupled to a drain region of an n channel NMOS pass gate transistor Tpg . The source region of the Tpg is coupled to another sense line e.g. bit line here referred to as bit line bar BL BAR .

As shown in the embodiment of the first and the second inverter and are cross coupled such that the one of the pair of first storage nodes e.g. of the first inverter is coupled to the gates of Tpu and Tpd and the other of the pair of first storage nodes e.g. of the second inverter is coupled to the gates of Tpu and Tpd . Each inverter and is coupled between a power supply node e.g. Vdd and ground. Hence as the reader will appreciate the cross coupled nature of the inverters and is intended to function such that a charge stored on one of the pair of first storage nodes e.g. will be different to that stored on the other of the pair of first storage nodes e.g. .

The gates of the pass gate transistors Tpg and are coupled to a select line e.g. word line WL . Operation on the pair of first storage nodes and is controlled by using the select line to turn on the Tpgs and and via a potential applied to BL and BL BAR . BL and BL BAR are accessed depending on the signal applied to the respective sense line and e.g. bit line via a row enable line BLRn . That is the BLRn can place an appropriate potential on BL and BL BAR by activating respective transistors and .

In normal e.g. powered up non standby SRAM operation a state on storage node e.g. a charge representing a data state 1 or a 0 which is associated with BL BAR in this example may be read by pre charging both BL and BL BAR to some potential e.g. Vcc 2. A potential is then applied to the select line e.g. WL in order to activate e.g. turn on the pass gate transistors Tpg and and read the state on storage node in the SRAM cell .

In normal e.g. powered up non standby SRAM operation a state e.g. a charge representing a data state 1 can be written to storage node associated with BL BAR in this example by grounding BL and charging BL BAR by raising BL BAR to some elevated potential e.g. Vcc. A potential is then applied to the select line e.g. WL in order to activate e.g. turn on the pass gate transistors Tpg and and write data e.g. a logic 1 to storage node in the SRAM cell .

As shown in the embodiment of each inverter and includes a second pair of storage nodes and coupled to a respective one of the first pair of storage nodes and . The first storage nodes and are static storage nodes and the second storage nodes and are non volatile storage nodes. In one or more embodiments a two terminal magnetic tunnel junction MTJ device described further in serves as the second storage nodes and . As the reader will appreciate an MTJ device is also sometimes referred to as a tunneling magneto resistive TMR device.

Each MTJ and comprises a first ferromagnetic layer and a second ferromagnetic layer separated by a dielectric . The first ferromagnetic layer is electrically connected to a respective one of the first storage nodes and . The second ferromagnetic layer is in contact with an anti ferromagnetic layer shown as in which is electrically connected to a control line CL .

As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure a number of SRAM cells such as SRAM cell in can be formed in an array. Each SRAM cell in the array can include a complementary pair of sense lines e.g. bit line BL and bit line bar BL BAR coupled to respective first storage nodes e.g. static storage nodes and in . As such connecting the control line to the pair of second storage nodes and can include connecting the control line to pairs of second storage nodes in a block of SRAM cells. Additionally one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the structure schematically illustrated in the embodiment of can be formed according to semiconductor fabrication techniques to form the pair of second storage nodes and above a layer in which the first storage nodes and of the SRAM are formed to conserve SRAM cell area.

As mentioned in connection with the embodiment of the first ferromagnetic layer can be connected to a respective one of the pair of first storage nodes in the cross coupled inventers in the SRAM e.g. and in . The first ferromagnetic layer is unpinned e.g. free such that a polarization of an associated spin value can rotate as reflected by the bidirectional arrow . The second ferromagnetic layer however is in contact with a layer of anti ferromagnetic material . By way of example and not by way of limitation materials that can be used to provide the anti ferromagnetic layer include alloys such as Iron Manganese FeMn Iridium Manganese IrMn and Platinum Manganese PtMn . This contact between the second ferromagnetic layer and the anti ferromagnetic layer pins e.g. fixes the second ferromagnetic layer to prevent a polarization of an associated spin value from rotating as reflected by the unidirectional arrow e.g. fixed in one direction .

As shown in when the spin values and are parallel the MTJ device will exhibit a lowest resistance value to current flow for a potential established between the device s two terminals e.g. and . For description purposes herein when the spin values and are parallel or substantially aligned the MTJ device is referred to as storing data associated with a logic value 1 . By contrast when the when the spin values and are anti parallel the MTJ device will exhibit a highest resistance value to current flow when a potential is established between the device s two terminals e.g. and . For description purposes herein when the spin values and are anti parallel the MTJ device is referred to as storing data associated with a logic value 0 . As such the MTJ device can be regarded as a variable resistor e.g. can alternate between a first and a second resistance and provides a non volatile storage capability.

In NORMAL powered on non standby mode of the SRAM as shown in a first potential e.g. first positive potential Vdd is applied to the control line . As mentioned above in connection with when a sufficiently negative potential is applied between the two terminals e.g. and of the MTJ devices and the magnetization of the first and the second ferromagnetic layers and transform from parallel to anti parallel switching the MTJ devices and into a highest resistance level state e.g. OFF state. Applying the first potential e.g. first positive potential Vdd to the control line the MTJ devices and can be maintained in an OFF state e.g. high resistance state R as shown in while the SRAM is being operated read from and written to in the NORMAL powered on non standby mode. That is the MTJ devices and will not conduct as the spin values associated with the first and the second ferromagnetic layers and of the second storage nodes and are anti parallel and the NORMAL operation of the SRAM is not affected.

In the operational embodiment of a STORE operation is performed to transfer data from a pair of static storage nodes and of the SRAM to a pair of non volatile storage nodes and in order to power down the SRAM e.g. place the SRAM in a standby mode. To do so the select line for the SRAM is turned off e.g. WL is grounded so that Tpgs and are not activated. A potential applied to the control line CL is changed from a first potential e.g. a first positive potential Vdd to a second potential e.g. ground. In this example embodiment because a low logic value e.g. 0 is stored on first storage node a low potential will be applied to p type Tpu such that Tpu is turned on and conducts. Hence grounding control line will create a current flow shown by arrow between a power supply potential e.g. Vdd coupled to the pull up transistor Tpu in the cross coupled pair of inverters and and the grounded control line .

As mentioned above in connection with when a tunneling current is passed through the dielectric between the first ferromagnetic layer and the second ferromagnetic layer of the MTJ device a torque operates on the first e.g. free ferromagnetic layer s magnetic moment due to the angular momentum carried by the spin polarized tunneling current. If the pulse current density is large enough the free ferromagnetic layer will switch magnetic states. Hence when a sufficiently high potential is applied between the two terminals and of the MTJ device the magnetization of the first and the second ferromagnetic layers and transform from anti parallel to parallel switching the MTJ device into a lowest resistance level state e.g. programmed to an ON state. Thus the logic 1 value on first e.g. static storage node will be transferred to second e.g. non volatile storage node through the Tpu .

On the other side of the cell because a high logic value e.g. 1 is stored on first storage node a high potential will be applied to p type Tpu such that Tpu is turned off and does not conduct. Hence grounding control line does not create a current flow through MTJ device and MTJ remains in an OFF state. By performing the STORE operation logic states on the first storage nodes and are remembered as ON OFF resistances of the non volatile MTJ devices and . The SRAM can then by powered down e.g. power supply Vdd removed from the cross coupled inverters and without losing its memory data e.g. stored logic state information. Next as shown in when the SRAM cell exits standby the previous logic states are recalled e.g. transferred from the second storage nodes and back to the first storage nodes and to return the SRAM to NORMAL operation.

In the operational embodiment of a RESTORE operation is performed to transfer data from a pair of non volatile storage nodes and of the SRAM to a pair of static storage nodes and in order to return the logic values from the pair of non volatile storage nodes and to the pair of static storage nodes and for NORMAL operation of the SRAM . To do so a potential applied to the control line is raised to the first potential e.g. first positive potential Vdd before powering up the SRAM . The resistances of the two MTJ devices and are at this point asymmetrical. That is MTJ has a first e.g. lower resistance state due to parallel spin values in the first and the second ferromagnetic layers and and MTJ has a second e.g. higher resistance state due to anti parallel spin values in the first and the second ferromagnetic layers and . Due to asymmetry of the resistances of the two MTJ devices and the first storage node connected with the ON MTJ device is charged faster than the first storage node connected with the OFF MTJ device . This charging of first storage node is reflected by current flow arrow in . Thus upon applying a power supply e.g. Vdd to the cross coupled inverters and of the SRAM the logic 1 value that was stored on the second non volatile storage node is restored to the first storage node and logic 0 value that was stored on the second non volatile storage node is restored to the first storage node which are the same logic states remembered in the STORE operation.

In the operational embodiment of a RESET operation is performed in order to return the SRAM to NORMAL operation. As shown in the embodiment of a second potential e.g. second positive potential boosted Vdd is applied to the control line . This action turns off the ON state of the second storages nodes and since as explained in connection with when a sufficiently negative potential is applied between the two terminals e.g. and of the MTJ devices and the magnetization of the first and the second ferromagnetic layers and transform from parallel to anti parallel switching the MTJ devices and into a highest resistance level state e.g. OFF state. This is shown in by current flow arrow passing through MTJ such that a torque is applied on the first e.g. free ferromagnetic layer s magnetic moment due to the angular momentum carried by the spin polarized tunneling current and switching the magnetization of the first and the second ferromagnetic layers and from parallel to anti parallel.

With the pair of second storage nodes and now in the OFF state the first potential e.g. first positive potential Vdd can once again be applied to the control line to resume NORMAL operation.

The logic signal BOOST determines the gate inputs A provided to PMOS T and PMOS T and A BAR gate inputs provided to NMOS T and PMOS T . As shown in the embodiment of the gate input A provided on signal line to transistors T and T is the same as the BOOST signal while the gate input A BAR provided on signal line to the transistors T and T is the invert of the BOOST signal .

A PULSE BAR logic signal is provided to the gate inputs of PMOS T and NMOS T . NMOS transistor T is coupled between the control line and ground. PMOS transistor T is coupled at its drain to control line and at its source to the rest of control circuit associated with the control line . When the PULSE BAR signal is high e.g. at first positive potential Vdd PMOS transistor T is OFF and NMOS transistor T is ON grounding the control line . When the PULSE BAR signal is low e.g. grounded NMOS transistor T is OFF and PMOS transistor T is ON . Therefore the potential applied to the control line is determined by the BOOST signal .

As reflected by logic table when a BOOST signal and the PULSE signal are both low e.g. logic 0 then PULSE BAR signal is high e.g. at first positive potential Vdd PMOS transistor T is OFF and NMOS transistor T is ON grounding the control line e.g. applying a first potential to the control line . As explained in connection with this action equates to the STORE mode such that data is transferred from the first e.g. static storage nodes and in to the second non volatile storage nodes and in of the SRAM when the SRAM is to be powered down or enter standby.

When a PULSE signal is high e.g. logic 1 then the PULSE BAR signal applied to NMOS transistor T and PMOS transistor T is low turning OFF NMOS T and turning ON PMOS T. When the BOOST signal level is low e.g. logic 0 PMOS transistors T and T having gate inputs A and NMOS transistor T having gate input A BAR are ON and conduct current while PMOS transistor T is OFF and does not conduct current. In this example embodiment capacitors C and C coupled between Vdd and ground through PMOS T and PMOS T are charged to full power supply potential e.g. Vdd and the potential applied to control line rises to Vdd e.g. applying a second potential to the control line . As explained in connection this action equates to the RESTORE mode such that data is transferred from the second non volatile storage nodes and in to the first e.g. static storage nodes and in of the SRAM before the SRAM is powered up or exits standby.

As noted above the control circuit can also be operated in this manner during the NORMAL operation mode of the SRAM. Alternatively as one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure the control line could also be floated not shown in during the NORMAL operation mode in order to maintain the second non volatile storage nodes and in in a higher resistance e.g. OFF state such that the powered up non standby read and write operations of the SRAM are not affected.

When a PULSE signal is high e.g. logic 1 then the PULSE BAR signal applied to NMOS transistor T and PMOS transistor T is low turning OFF NMOS T and turning ON PMOS T. When the BOOST signal level is high e.g. logic 1 PMOS transistors T and T having gate inputs A and NMOS transistor T having gate input A BAR are OFF and do not conduct current while PMOS transistor T is ON and does conduct current. This action can be taken in sequence following the RESTORE operation such that capacitors C and C are now connected in series boosting the potential applied to the control line to an elevated potential e.g. Vdd in effect applying a third potential to the control line .

As explained in connection this action equates to the RESET mode and supplies a sufficiently high current density pulse through the second storage nodes e.g. and in such that the magnetization of the first and the second ferromagnetic layers e.g. and in transform from parallel to anti parallel switching the second storage nodes into a highest resistance level state e.g. OFF state such that the powered up non standby read and write operations of the SRAM are not affected once the SRAM is powered up or exits standby.

The memory system can include separate integrated circuits or both the processor and the memory device can be on the same integrated circuit. The processor can be a microprocessor or some other type of controlling circuitry such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

The embodiment of includes address circuitry to latch address signals provided over I O connections through I O circuitry . Address signals are received and decoded by a row decoder and a column decoder to access the memory array . In light of the present disclosure it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the number of address input connections depends on the density and architecture of the memory array and that the number of addresses increases with both increased numbers of memory cells and increased numbers of memory blocks and arrays.

The memory device reads data in the memory array by sensing voltage and or current changes in the memory array columns using sense buffer circuitry that in this embodiment can be read latch circuitry . The read latch circuitry can read and latch a page or row of data from the memory array . I O circuitry is included for bi directional data communication over the I O connections with the processor . Write circuitry is included to write data to the memory array .

Control circuitry decodes signals provided by control connections from the processor . These signals can include chip signals write enable signals and address latch signals that are used to control the operations on the memory array including data read data write and data erase operations. In one or more embodiments the control circuitry is responsible for executing instructions from the processor to perform the operating embodiments of the present disclosure. The control circuitry can be a state machine a sequencer or some other type of controller. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additional circuitry and control signals can be provided and that the memory device detail of has been reduced to facilitate ease of illustration.

In one or more embodiments memory module will include a housing as depicted to enclose one or more memory devices though such a housing is not essential to all devices or device applications. At least one memory device includes a non volatile SRAM that can be formed and operated according to one or more embodiments described herein. Where present the housing includes one or more contacts for communication with a host device. Examples of host devices include digital cameras digital recording and playback devices PDAs personal computers memory card readers interface hubs and the like. For one or more embodiments the contacts are in the form of a standardized interface. For example with a USB flash drive the contacts might be in the form of a USB Type A male connector. For one or more embodiments the contacts are in the form of a semi proprietary interface such as might be found on CompactFlash memory cards licensed by SanDisk Corporation Memory Stick memory cards licensed by Sony Corporation SD Secure Digital memory cards licensed by Toshiba Corporation and the like. In general however contacts provide an interface for passing control address and or data signals between the memory module and a host having compatible receptors for the contacts .

The memory module may optionally include additional circuitry which may be one or more integrated circuits and or discrete components. For one or more embodiments the additional circuitry may include control circuitry such as a memory controller for controlling access across multiple memory devices and or for providing a translation layer between an external host and a memory device . For example there may not be a one to one correspondence between the number of contacts and a number of connections to the one or more memory devices . Thus a memory controller could selectively couple an I O connection not shown in of a memory device to receive the appropriate signal at the appropriate I O connection at the appropriate time or to provide the appropriate signal at the appropriate contact at the appropriate time. Similarly the communication protocol between a host and the memory module may be different than what is required for access of a memory device . A memory controller could then translate the command sequences received from a host into the appropriate command sequences to achieve the desired access to the memory device . Such translation may further include changes in signal voltage levels in addition to command sequences.

The additional circuitry may further include functionality unrelated to control of a memory device such as logic functions as might be performed by an ASIC. Also the additional circuitry may include circuitry to restrict read or write access to the memory module such as password protection biometrics or the like. The additional circuitry may include circuitry to indicate a status of the memory module . For example the additional circuitry may include functionality to determine whether power is being supplied to the memory module and whether the memory module is currently being accessed and to display an indication of its status such as a solid light while powered and a flashing light while being accessed. The additional circuitry may further include passive devices such as decoupling capacitors to help regulate power requirements within the memory module .
