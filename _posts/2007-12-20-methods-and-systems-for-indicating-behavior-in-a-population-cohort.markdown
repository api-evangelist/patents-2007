In the device is illustrated as possibly being included within a system . Of course virtually any kind of computing device may be used to implement the physiologic activity measurement unit surrogate marker measurement unit association unit attribute specification unit and or presentation unit such as for example a workstation a desktop computer a networked computer a server a collection of servers and or databases a virtual machine running inside a computing device a mobile computing device or a tablet PC.

Additionally not all of the physiologic activity measurement unit surrogate marker measurement unit association unit population cohort identification unit attribute specification unit and or presentation unit need be implemented on a single computing device. For example one or more of the physiologic activity measurement unit surrogate marker measurement unit association unit population cohort identification unit attribute specification unit and or presentation unit may be implemented and or operable on a remote computer while one or more of these functions are implemented and or occur on a local computer. Further aspects of the physiologic activity measurement unit may be implemented in different combinations and implementations than that shown in . For example functionality of a physiologic activity measurement unit may be incorporated into the surrogate marker measurement unit association unit population cohort identification unit attribute specification unit and or presentation unit . The association unit population cohort identification unit and or attribute specification unit may perform simple data relay functions and or complex data analysis including for example fuzzy logic and or traditional logic steps. Further many methods of searching functional brain mapping and or surrogate marker activity databases known in the art may be used including for example unsupervised pattern discovery methods coincidence detection methods and or entity relationship modeling. In some embodiments the association unit may process physiologic activity measurements according to activity profiles available as updates through a network. Similarly in some embodiments the population cohort identification unit and or attribute specification unit may process association unit output according to population cohort media content avatar attribute and or avatar profiles available as updates through a network.

Outputs of physiologic activity measurement unit surrogate marker measurement unit association unit population cohort identification unit attribute specification unit and or presentation unit may be stored in virtually any type of memory that is able to store and or provide access to information in for example a one to many many to one and or many to many relationship. Such a memory may include for example a relational database and or an object oriented database examples of which are provided in more detail herein.

Device may also include attribute specification unit which may in turn include voice specification unit which may in turn include speech specification unit . Attribute specification unit may include non verbal attribute specification unit which may in turn include facial attribute specification unit clothing specification unit and or body attribute specification unit .

Presentation device may include presentation unit which may in turn include display which may in turn include desktop display and or mobile display which may in turn include pico projector and or wearable display . Member of population cohort and or multiple members of population cohort may be monitored by device including physiologic activity measurement unit . Member of population cohort multiple members of population cohort and or one or more members of population may interact with presentation device including presentation unit .

In this way a member of population cohort or a member of population who may be interacting with a presentation device that is connected through a network with a device e.g. in a home an office outdoors and or in a public environment may interact with the system as if the member of population cohort or member of population were interacting locally with the device on which the association unit population cohort identification unit and or attribute specification unit is operable. In such an embodiment the physiologic activity measurement unit and or surrogate marker measurement unit may also be located locally with the member of population cohort or member of population transmitting output via network to a remote association unit population cohort identification unit and or attribute specification unit .

As referenced herein the device association unit population cohort identification unit and or attribute specification unit may be used to perform various data querying and or recall techniques with respect to output of physiologic activity measurement unit and or output of association unit respectively in order to for example obtain identify and or transmit an avatar attribute and or population cohort based on a mental state associated with a physiological activity of member of population cohort or member of population . For example where the output of physiologic activity measurement unit is organized keyed to and or otherwise accessible using one or more reference physiologic activity profiles association unit may employ various Boolean statistical and or semi boolean searching techniques to match physiologic activity measurement output with one or more appropriate mental states. Similarly for example where association unit output is organized keyed to and or otherwise accessible using one or more reference population cohort profiles various Boolean statistical and or semi boolean searching techniques may be performed by population cohort identification unit to match the mental state of the member of population with one or more appropriate population cohorts.

Many examples of databases and database structures may be used in connection with the device association unit and or attribute specification unit . Such examples include hierarchical models in which data is organized in a tree and or parent child node structure network models based on set theory and in which multi parent structures per child node are supported or object relational models combining the relational model with the object oriented model .

Still other examples include various types of eXtensible Mark up Language XML databases. For example a database may be included that holds data in some format other than XML but that is associated with an XML interface for accessing the database using XML. As another example a database may store XML data directly. Additionally or alternatively virtually any semi structured database may be used so that context may be provided to associated with stored data elements either encoded with the data elements or encoded externally to the data elements so that data storage and or access may be facilitated.

Such databases and or other memory storage techniques may be written and or implemented using various programming or coding languages. For example object oriented database management systems may be written in programming languages such as for example C or Java. Relational and or object relational models may make use of database languages such as for example the structured query language SQL which may be used for example for interactive queries for information and or for gathering and or compiling data from the relational database s .

For example SQL or SQL like operations over one or more reference physiologic activity measurement and or reference mental state may be performed or Boolean operations using a reference physiologic activity measurement and or reference mental state may be performed. For example weighted Boolean operations may be performed in which different weights or priorities are assigned to one or more of the reference physiologic activity measurements and or reference mental states including reference physiologic activity measurements and or reference mental states associated with various reference avatar attributes perhaps relative to one another. For example a number weighted exclusive OR operation may be performed to request specific weightings of desired or undesired physiologic activity reference data to be included or excluded. Reference physiologic activity measurements may include normal physiological values for an individual in a demographic group responding to a given stimulus. Such normal physiological activity values may be normal relative to the member of population cohort to a group of population cohort to the entire population cohort to a member of population and or the entire population . Similarly reference demographic characteristics may be associated with a general population or a subpopulation defined by such things as age gender ethnicity or other demographic measure known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

Measuring at least one physiologic activity of a member of population cohort may include measuring magnetic electrical hemodynamic and or metabolic activity in the brain.

One method of measuring at least one physiologic activity may include measuring the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brain via magnetoencephalography MEG using magnetometers such as superconducting quantum interference devices SQUIDs or other devices. Such measurements are commonly used in both research and clinical settings to e.g. assist researchers in determining the function of various parts of the brain. Synchronized neuronal currents indicate very weak magnetic fields that can be measured by magnetoencephalography. However the magnetic field of the brain is considerably smaller at 10 femtotesla fT for cortical activity and 103 fT for the human alpha rhythm than the ambient magnetic noise in an urban environment which is on the order of 108 fT. Two essential problems of biomagnetism arise weakness of the signal and strength of the competing environmental noise. The development of extremely sensitive measurement devices such as SQUIDs facilitates analysis of the brain s magnetic field in spite of the relatively low signal versus ambient magnetic signal noise. Magnetoencephalography and EEG signals derive from the net effect of ionic currents flowing in the dendrites of neurons during synaptic transmission. In accordance with Maxwell s equations any electrical current will produce an orthogonally oriented magnetic field. It is this field that is measured with MEG. The net currents can be thought of as current dipoles which are currents having an associated position orientation and magnitude but no spatial extent. According to the right hand rule a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that flows around the axis of its vector component.

In order to generate a detectable signal approximately 50 000 active neurons are needed. Because current dipoles must have similar orientations to generate magnetic fields that reinforce each other it is often the layer of pyramidal cells in the cortex which are generally perpendicular to its surface that give rise to measurable magnetic fields. Further it is often bundles of these neurons located in the sulci of the cortex with orientations parallel to the surface of the head that project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head.

Smaller magnetometers are in development including a mini magnetometer that uses a single milliwatt infrared laser to excite rubidium in the context of an applied perpendicular magnetic field. The amount of laser light absorbed by the rubidium atoms varies predictably with the magnetic field providing a reference scale for measuring the field. The stronger the magnetic field the more light is absorbed. Such a system is currently sensitive to the 70 fT range and is expected to increase in sensitivity to the 10 fT range. See Physorg.com New mini sensor may have biomedical and security applications Nov. 1 2007 http www.physorg.com news113151078.html.

Another method of measuring at least one physiologic activity may include measuring the electrical activity of the brain by recording from electrodes placed on the scalp or in special cases subdurally or in the cerebral cortex. The resulting traces are known as an electroencephalogram EEG and represent a summation of post synaptic potentials from a large number of neurons. EEG is most sensitive to a particular set of post synaptic potentials those which are generated in superficial layers of the cortex on the crests of gyri directly abutting the skull and radial to the skull. Dendrites that are deeper in the cortex inside sulci are in midline or deep structures such as the cingulate gyrus or hippocampus or that produce currents that are tangential to the skull make a smaller contribution to the EEG signal.

One application of EEG is event related potential ERP analysis. An ERP is any measured brain response that is directly the result of a thought or perception. ERPs can be reliably measured using electroencephalography EEG a procedure that measures electrical activity of the brain typically through the skull and scalp. As the EEG reflects thousands of simultaneously ongoing brain processes the brain response to a certain stimulus or event of interest is usually not visible in the EEG. One of the most robust features of the ERP response is a response to unpredictable stimuli. This response is known as the P300 P3 and manifests as a positive deflection in voltage approximately 300 milliseconds after the stimulus is presented.

The most robust ERPs are seen after many dozens or hundreds of individual presentations are averaged together. This technique cancels out noise in the data allowing only the voltage response to the stimulus to stand out clearly. While evoked potentials reflect the processing of the physical stimulus event related potentials are caused by higher processes such as memory expectation attention or other changes in mental state.

A two channel wireless brain wave monitoring system powered by a thermo electric generator has been developed by IMEC Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre Leuven Belgium . This device uses the body heat dissipated naturally from the forehead as a means to generate its electrical power. The wearable EEG system operates autonomously with no need to change or recharge batteries. The EEG monitor prototype is wearable and integrated into a headband where it consumes 0.8 milliwatts. A digital signal processing block encodes extracted EEG data which is sent to a PC via a 2.4 GHz wireless radio link. The thermoelectric generator is mounted on the forehead and converts the heat flow between the skin and air into electrical power. The generator is composed of 10 thermoelectric units interconnected in a flexible way. At room temperature the generated power is about 2 to 2.5 mW or 0.03 mW per square centimeter which is the theoretical limit of power generation from the human skin. Such a device is proposed to associate emotion with EEG signals. See Clarke IMEC has a brain wave feed EEG emotion back into games EE Times online http www.eetimes.eu design 202801063 Nov. 1 2007 .

EEG can be recorded at the same time as MEG so that data from these complimentary high time resolution techniques can be combined.

Measuring at least one physiologic activity of a member of population cohort may also include measuring metabolic or hemodynamic responses to neural activity. For example in positron emission tomography PET positrons the antiparticles of electrons are emitted by certain radionuclides that have the same chemical properties as their non radioactive isotopes and that can replace the latter in biologically relevant molecules. After injection or inhalation of tiny amount of these modified molecules e.g. modified glucose FDG or neurotransmitters their spatial distribution can be detected by a PET scanner. This device is sensitive to radiation resulting from the annihilation of emitted positrons when they collide with ubiquitously present electrons. Detected distribution information concerning metabolism or brain perfusion can be derived and visualized in tomograms. Spatial resolution is on the order of about 3 6 mm and temporal resolution is on the order of several minutes to fractions of an hour.

Another method for measuring physiologic activity is functional near infrared imaging fNIR . fNIR is a spectroscopic neuro imaging method for measuring the level of neuronal activity in the brain. The method is based on neuro vascular coupling i.e. the relationship between neuronal metabolic activity and oxygen level oxygenated hemoglobin in blood vessels in proximity to the neurons.

Time resolved frequency domain spectroscopy the frequency domain signal is the Fourier transform of the original time domain signal may be used in fNIR to provide quantitation of optical characteristics of the tissue and therefore offer robust information about oxygenation. Diffuse optical tomography DOT in fNIR enables researchers to produce images of absorption by dividing the region of interest into thousands of volume units called voxels calculating the amount of absorption in each the forward model and then putting the voxels back together the inverse problem . fNIR systems commonly have multiple sources and detectors signifying broad coverage of areas of interest and high sensitivity and specificity. fNIR systems today often consist of little more than a probe with fiber optic sources and detectors a piece of dedicated hardware no larger than a small suitcase and a laptop computer. Thus FNIR systems can be portable indeed battery operated wireless continuous wave fNIR devices have been developed at the Optical Brain Imaging Lab of Drexel University. fNIR employs no ionizing radiation and allows for a wide range of movement it s possible for example for a subject to walk around a room while wearing a fNIR probe. fNIR studies have examined cerebral responses to visual auditory and somatosensory stimuli as well as the motor system and language and subsequently begun to construct maps of functional activation showing the areas of the brain associated with particular stimuli and activities.

For example a fNIR spectroscopy device fNIRS has been developed that looks like a headband and uses laser diodes to send near infrared light through the forehead at a relatively shallow depth e.g. two to three centimeters to interact with the brain s frontal lobe. Light ordinarily passes through the body s tissues except when it encounters oxygenated or deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. Light waves are absorbed by the active blood filled areas of the brain and any remaining light is diffusely reflected to fNIRS detectors. See Technology could enable computers to read the minds of users Physorg.com http www.physorg.com news110463755.html 1 Oct. 2007 .

There are three types of fNIR 1 CW continuous wave In this method infrared light shines at the same intensity level during the measurement period. The detected signal is lower intensity static signal dc valued 2 FD frequency domain In this method input signal is a modulated sinusoid at some frequency and detected output signal has changes in amplitude and phase 3 TR time resolved In time resolve spectroscopy a very short pulse is introduced to be measured and the pulse length is usually on the order of picoseconds. The detected signal is usually a longer signal and has a decay time.

In one approach an infrared imager captures an image of a portion of the user. For example the imager may capture a portion of the user s forehead. Infrared imaging may provide an indication of blood oxygen levels which in turn may be indicative of brain activity. With such imaging the infrared imager may produce a signal indicative of brain activity. According to one method hemoglobin oxygen saturation and relative hemoglobin concentration in a tissue may be ascertained from diffuse reflectance spectra in the visible wavelength range. This method notes that while oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin contributions to light attenuation are strongly variable functions of wavelength all other contributions to the attenuation including scattering are smooth wavelength functions and can be approximated by Taylor series expansion. Based on this assumption a simple robust algorithm suitable for real time monitoring of the hemoglobin oxygen saturation in the tissue was derived. This algorithm can be used with different fiber probe configurations for delivering and collecting light passed through tissue. See Stratonnikov et al. Evaluation of blood oxygen saturation in vivo from diffuse reflectance spectra J. Biomed. Optics vol. 6 pp. 457 467 2001 .

Another method of measuring at least one physiologic activity may include measuring blood oxygen level dependent effects by for example functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI . fMRI involves the use of magnetic resonance scanners to produce sets of cross sections tomograms of the brain detecting weak but measurable resonance signals that are emitted by tissue water subjected to a very strong magnetic field after excitation with a high frequency electromagnetic pulse. Acquired resonance signals can be attributed to their respective spatial origins and cross sectional images can be calculated. The signal intensity often coded as a gray value of a picture element depends on water content and certain magnetic properties of the local tissue. In general structural MR imaging is used to depict brain morphology with good contrast and high resolution. Visualizing brain function by MRI relies on the relationship between increased neural activity of a brain region and increased hemodynamic response or blood flow to that brain region. The increased perfusion of activated brain tissue is the basis of the so called Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent BOLD effect hemoglobin the oxygen carrying molecule in blood has different magnetic properties depending on its oxygenation state. While oxyhemoglobin is diamagnetic deoxyhemoglobin is paramagnetic which means that it locally distorts the magnetic field leading to a local signal loss. In activated brain tissue the increased oxygen consumption is accompanied by a blood flow response. Thus during activation of a brain region deoxyhemoglobin is partly replaced by oxyhemoglobin leading to less distortion of the local magnetic field and increased signal intensity. Color coded statistical parametric activation maps SPMs are typically generated from statistical analyses of fMRI time series comparing signal intensity during different activation states.

Temporal and spatial resolution of fMRI depends on both scanning technology and the underlying physiology of the detected signal intensity changes. Structural images are usually obtained with a resolution of at least 1 mm 1 mm 1 mm voxels the equivalent of a pixel in a volume while fMRI voxels typically have edge lengths of about 3 5 mm. Temporal resolution of fMRI is on the order of between 1 and 3 seconds. The cerebral blood flow CBF response to a brain activation is delayed by about 3 6 seconds. There is a balance between temporal and spatial resolution allowing whole brain scans in less than 3 seconds and non invasiveness permitting repeated measurements without adverse events. In addition the choice of scanning parameters allows increasing one parameter at the expense of the other. Recent fMRI approaches show that for some neural systems the temporal resolution can be improved down to milliseconds and spatial resolution can be increased to the level of cortical columns as basic functional units of the cortex.

In one embodiment an fMRI protocol may include fMRI data may be acquired with an MRI scanner such as a 3 T Magnetom Trio Siemens scanner. T2 weighted functional MR images may be obtained using axially oriented echo planar imaging. For each subject data may be acquired in three scanning sessions or functional runs. The first four volumes of each session may be discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. For anatomical reference a high resolution T1 weighted anatomical image may be obtained. Foam cushioning may be placed tightly around the side of the subject s head to minimize artifacts from head motion. Data preprocessing and statistical analysis may be carried out using a statistical parametric mapping function such as SPM99 Statistical Parametric Mapping Wellcome Institute of Cognitive Neurology London UK . Individual functional images may be realigned slice time corrected normalized into a standard anatomical space resulting in isotropic 3 mm voxels and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm. In one embodiment a standard anatomical space may be based on the ICBM 152 brain template MNI Montreal Neurological Institute . A block design model with a boxcar regressor convoluted with the hemodynamic response function may be used as the predictor to compare activity related to a stimulus versus a control object. High frequency noise may be removed using a low pass filter e.g. Gaussian kernel with 4.0 s FWHM and low frequency drifts may be removed via a high pass filter. Effects of the conditions for each subject may be compared using linear contrast resulting in a t statistic for each voxel. A group analysis may be carried out on a second level using a whole brain random effect analysis one sample t test . Regions that contain a minimum of five contiguous voxels thresholded at P

When brain activity data are collected from groups of individuals data analysis across individuals may take into account variation in brain anatomy between and among individuals. To compare brain activations between individuals the brains are usually spatially normalized to a template or control brain. In one approach they are transformed so that they are similar in overall size and spatial orientation. Generally the goal of this transformation is to bring homologous brain areas into the closest possible alignment. In this context the Talairach stereotactic coordinate system is often used. The Talairach system involves a coordinate system to identify a particular brain location relative to anatomical landmarks a spatial transformation to match one brain to another and an atlas describing a standard brain with anatomical and cytoarchitectonic labels. The coordinate system is based on the identification of the line connecting the anterior commissure AC and posterior commissure PC two relatively invariant fiber bundles connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. The AC PC line defines the y axis of the brain coordinate system. The origin is set at the AC. The z axis is orthogonal to the AC PC line in the foot head direction and passes through the interhemispheric fissure. The x axis is orthogonal to both the other axes and points from AC to the right. Any point in the brain can be identified relative to these axes.

Accordingly anatomical regions may be identified using the Talairach coordinate system or the Talairach daemon TD and the nomenclature of Brodmann. The Talairach daemon is a high speed database server for querying and retrieving data about human brain structure over the internet. The core components of this server are a unique memory resident application and memory resident databases. The memory resident design of the TD server provides high speed access to its data. This is supported by using TCP IP sockets for communications and by minimizing the amount of data transferred during transactions. A TD server data may be searched using x y z coordinates resolved to 1 1 1 mm volume elements within a standardized stereotaxic space. An array indexed by x y z coordinates that spans 170 mm x 210 mm y and 200 mm z provides high speed access to data. Array dimensions are approximately 25 larger than those of the Co planar Stereotaxic Atlas of the Human Brain Talairach and Tournoux 1988 . Coordinates tracked by a TD server are spatially consistent with the Talairach Atlas. Each array location stores a pointer to a relation record that holds data describing what is present at the corresponding coordinate. Data in relation records are either Structure Probability Maps SP Maps or Talairach Atlas Labels though others can be easily added. The relation records are implemented as linked lists to names and values for brain structures. The TD server may be any computing device such as a Sun Sparcstation 20 with 200 Mbytes of memory. Such a system provides 24 hour access to the data using a variety of client applications.

Some commercially available analysis software such as SPM5 available for download from http www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk spm software spm5 uses brain templates created by the Montreal Neurological Institute MNI based on the average of many normal MR brain scans. Although similar the Talairach and the MNI templates are not identical and care should be given to assigning localizations given in MNI coordinates correctly to for example cytoarchitectonically defined brain areas like the Brodmann areas BA s which are regions in the brain cortex defined in many different species based on its cytoarchitecture. Cytoarchitecture is the organization of the cortex as observed when a tissue is stained for nerve cells. Brodmann areas were originally referred to by numbers from 1 to 52. Some of the original areas have been subdivided further and referred to e.g. as and . The Brodmann areas for the human brain include the following 

Area 11 Orbitofrontal area orbital and rectus gyri plus part of the rostral part of the superior frontal gyrus 

Area 12 Orbitofrontal area used to be part of BA11 refers to the area between the superior frontal gyrus and the inferior rostral sulcus 

The brain performs a multitude of functions. It is the location of memory including working memory semantic memory and episodic memory. Attention is controlled by the brain as is language cognitive abilities and visual spatial functions. The brain also receives sensory signals and generates motor impulses. The frontal lobes of the brain are involved in most higher level cognitive tasks as well as episodic and semantic memory. There is some degree of lateralization of the frontal lobes e.g. the right frontal lobe is a locus for sustained attention and episodic memory retrieval and the left frontal lobe is a locus for language semantic memory retrieval and episodic memory encoding.

The cingulated regions of the brain are associated with memory initiation and inhibition of behavior and emotion. The parietal regions of the brain are associated with attention spatial perception and imagery thinking involving time and numbers working memory skill learning and successful episodic memory retrieval. The lateral temporal lobe of the brain is associated with language and semantic memory encoding and retrieval while the medial temporal lobe is associated with episodic memory encoding and retrieval. The occipital temporal regions of the brain are associated with vision and visual spatial processing.

Attention can be divided into five categories sustained attention selective attention Stimulus Response compatibility orientation of attention and division of attention. The tasks included in the sustained attention section involved continuous monitoring of different kinds of stimuli e.g. somatosensory stimulation . The selective attention section includes studies in which subjects selectively attended to different attributes of the same set of stimuli e.g. attend to color only for stimuli varying with respect to both color and shape . The stimulus response SR compatibility section also includes studies examining selective attention with the important difference that they involve a conflict component. In all cases this is implemented by employing the Stroop task.

Prefrontal and parietal areas preferentially in the right hemisphere are frequently engaged during tasks requiring attention. An fMRI study involving a visual vigilance task was in close agreement with the results of a PET study showing predominantly right sided prefrontal and parietal activation. Observed data is consistent with a right fronto parietal network for sustained attention. Selective attention to one sensory modality is correlated with suppressed activity in regions associated with other modalities. For example studies have found deactivations in the auditory cortex during attention area activations. Taken together the results suggest the existence of a fronto parietal network underlying sustained attention. Direct support for fronto parietal interactions during sustained attention has been provided by structural equation modeling of fMRI data. Studies on the effects of attention on thalamic intralaminar nuclei and brain stem midbrain tegmentum activity have shown that these areas may control the transition from relaxed wakefulness to high general attention.

Selective attention is characterized by increased activity in posterior regions involved in stimulus processing. Different regions seem to be involved depending on the specific attribute that is attended to. Studies have shown attentional modulation of auditory regions and modulation of activity in the lingual and fusiform gyri during a color attention task has also been demonstrated. Attending to motion activates a region in occipito temporal cortex and it has also been shown that in addition to extrastriate regions attention to motion increased activity in several higher order areas as well. It may be that activity in extrastriate regions may be modulated by prefrontal parietal and thalamic regions. Similarly modulation of activity in specific posterior regions is mediated by regions in parietal and anterior cingulate cortices as well as the pulvinar. A role of parietal cortex especially the inferior parietal lobe in control of selective attention has also been suggested. The prefrontal cortex may also play a role in attentional modulation. As long as attentional load is low task irrelevant stimuli are perceived and elicit neural activity however when the attentional load is increased irrelevant perception and its associated activity is strongly reduced.

The stimulus response compatibility panel includes selective attention studies on the Stroop test. The Stroop test is associated with activations in the anterior cingulate cortex. SR compatibility studies point to a role of both the anterior cingulate and the left prefrontal cortex. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Activation of the thalamic reticular nucleus is also associated with selective attention. See Contreras et al. Inactivation of the Interoceptive Insula Disrupts Drug Craving and Malaise Indicated by Lithium Science vol. 318 pp. 655 658 26 Oct. 2007 .

The category orientation of attention includes studies associating shifts of spatial attention to parietal and prefrontal regions. Another study found activations in superior parietal regions during a visual search for conjunction of features. Based on the similarities in activation patterns it appears that serial shifts of attention took place during the search task. There is also evidence for a large scale neural system for visuospatial attention that includes the right posterior parietal cortex. PET and fMRI have been employed to study attentional orienting to spatial locations left vs. right and to time intervals short vs. long stimulus onset times . Both spatial and temporal orienting were found to activate a number of brain regions including prefrontal and parietal brain regions. Other analyses revealed that activations in the intraparietal sulcus were right lateralized for spatial attention and left lateralized for temporal attention. Moreover simultaneous spatial and temporal attention activate mainly parietal regions suggesting that the parietal cortex especially in the right hemisphere is a site for interactions between different attentional processes. Parietal activation has also been demonstrated in an fMRI study of nonspatial attention shifting. In addition the cerebellum has been implicated in attention shifting and this is consistent with other findings of attentional activation of the cerebellum. It has also been shown that spatial direction of attention can influence the response of the extrastriate cortex. Specifically it was demonstrated that while multiple stimuli in the visual field interact with each other in a suppressive way spatially directed attention partially cancels out the suppressive effects.

With respect to division of attention activity in the left prefrontal cortex increases under divided attention conditions. In this context it is also relevant to mention that if two tasks activate overlapping brain areas there may be significant interference effects when the tasks are performed simultaneously. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Perception processes can be divided into object face space motion smell and other categories. Object perception is associated with activations in the ventral pathway ventral brain areas 18 19 and 37 . The ventral occipito temporal pathway is associated with object information whereas the dorsal occipito parietal pathway is associated with spatial information. For example it has been shown that viewing novel as well as familiar line drawings relative to scrambled drawings activated a bilateral extrastriate area near the border between the occipital and temporal lobes. Based on these findings it appears that this area is concerned with bottom up construction of shape descriptions from simple visual features. It has also been shown that a region termed the lateral occipital complex LO is selectively activated by different kinds of shapes e.g. shapes defined by motion texture and luminance contours . Greater activity in lingual gyrus Area 19 and or inferior fusiform gyrus Area 37 is seen when subjects make judgments about appearance than when they make judgments about locations providing confirmation that object identity preferentially activates regions in the ventral pathway. Both ventral and dorsal activations during shape based object recognition suggests that visual object processing involves both pathways to some extent a similar conclusion has been drawn based on network analysis of PET data .

Face perception involves the same ventral pathway as object perception but there is a tendency for right lateralization of activations for faces but not for objects. For example bilateral fusiform gyrus activation is seen for faces but with more extensive activation in the right hemisphere. Faces are perceived at least in part by a separate processing stream within the ventral object pathway. In an fMRI study a region was identified that is more responsive to faces than to objects termed the fusiform face area or FF area.

Whereas perception of objects and faces tends to preferentially activate regions in the ventral visual pathway perception of spatial location tends to selectively activate more dorsal regions located in parietal cortex. Greater activity in the superior parietal lobe area 7 as well as in the premotor cortex is seen during location judgments than during object judgments. The dorsal pathway is not only associated with space perception but also with action. For example perception of scripts of goal directed hand action engage parts of the parietal cortex. Comparison have been done of meaningful actions e.g. pantomime of opening a bottle and meaningless actions e.g. signs from the American Sign Language that were unknown to subjects . Whereas meaningless actions activated the dorsal pathway meaningful actions activated the ventral pathway. Meaningless actions appear to be decoded in terms of spatiotemporal layout while meaningful actions are processed by areas that allow semantic processing and memory storage. Thus as object perception location action perception may involve both dorsal and ventral pathways to some extent.

Activations in the orbitofrontal cortex where the secondary olfactory cortex is located particularly in the right hemisphere and the cerebellum are associated with smelling as well as increased activity in the primary olfactory cortex piriform cortex . Odorants regardless of sniffing activate the posterior lateral cerebellum whereas sniffing nonodorized air activate anterior parts of the cerebellum. Thus the cerebellum receives olfactory information for modulating sniffing. Odorants regardless of sniffing activate the anterior and lateral orbitofrontal cortex whereas sniffing even in the absence of odorants activates the piriform and medial posterior orbitofrontal cortices. In sum smell perception involves primarily the orbitofrontal cortex and parts of the cerebellum and its neural correlates can be dissociated from those of sniffing.

With respect to the other category fMRI has been employed to define a parahippocampal place area PPA that responds selectively to passively viewed scenes. A region probably overlapping with PPA responds selectively to buildings and this brain region may respond to stimuli that have orienting value e.g. isolated landmarks as well as scenes . The neural correlates of music perception have been localized to specialized neural systems in the right superior temporal cortex which participate in perceptual analysis of melodies. Attention to changes in rhythm activate Broca s insular regions in the left hemisphere pointing to a role of this area in the sequencing of auditory input. Further studies of emotional perception suggest that perception of different kinds of emotion are based on separate neural systems with a possible convergence in prefrontal regions area 47 . Consistent with the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning the amygdala is more activated for fearful faces relative to happy faces. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Imagery can be defined as manipulating sensory information that comes not from the senses but from memory. The memory representations manipulated can be in working memory e.g. holding three spatial locations for 3 seconds episodic memory e.g. retrieving the location of an object in the study phase or semantic memory e.g. retrieving the shape of a bicycle . Thus imagery related contrasts could be classified within working memory episodic retrieval and semantic retrieval sections. Imagery contrasts can be described as visuospatial retrieval contrasts and vice versa.

A central issue in the field of imagery has been whether those visual areas that are involved when an object is perceived are also involved when an object is imagined. In its strictest form this idea would imply activation of the primary visual cortex in the absence of any visual input. A series of PET experiments provides support for similarities between visual perception and visual imagery by showing increased blood flow in Area 17 during imagery. In particular by comparing tasks involving image formation for small and large letters respectively these studies provide evidence that imagery activates the topographically mapped primary visual cortex. A subsequent PET study involving objects of three different sizes provides additional support that visual imagery activates the primary visual cortex.

Increased activation in extrastriate visual regions is also associated with imaging tasks. The left inferior temporal lobe area 37 is most reliably activated across subjects for some subjects the activation extended into area 19 of the occipital lobe . Compared with a resting state a left posterior inferior temporal region was also activated. Moreover mental imagery of spoken concrete words has been shown to activate the inferior temporal gyrus fusiform gyrus bilaterally. Thus right temporal activation may be related to more complex visual imagery.

Color imagery and color perception engage overlapping networks anterior to region V an area specialized for color perception whereas areas V V were selectively activated by color perception. There is an increase in primary visual cortex activity during negative imagery as compared to neutral imagery. The primary visual cortex therefore appears to have a role in visual imagery and emotion appears to affect the quality of the image representations.

Mental rotation of visual stimuli involves lateral parietal areas BA47 and BA40 . The bulk of the computation for this kind of mental rotation is performed in the superior parietal lobe. PET has been employed to study a mental rotation task in which subjects were asked to decide whether letters and digits tilted in 120 180 or 240 were in normal or mirror image form. The left parietal cortex is activated in this task.

Mental exploration of maps or routes has been studied using PET revealing that this task is associated with increased activity in the right superior occipital cortex the supplementary motor area SMA and the cerebellar vermis. The latter two activations are related to eye movements and it appears that the superior occipital cortex has a specific role in generation and maintenance of visual mental images. In a subsequent PET study occipital activation was again observed although this time the peak was in left middle occipital gyrus. This activation was specific to a task involving mental navigation static visual imagery was not associated with occipital activation. Mental navigation tasks appears to tap visual memory to a high extent and feedback influences from areas involved in visual memory may activate visual occipital areas during certain imagery tasks.

Thus visual mental imagery is a function of the visual association cortex although different association areas seem to be involved depending on the task demands. In addition prefrontal areas have been activated in many of the reported comparisons. Partly these effects may be driven by eye movements especially for areas 6 and 8 but other factors such as image generation and combination of parts into a whole may account for some activations as well.

Neuroanatomical correlates of motor imagery via a mental writing task implicate a left parietal region in motor imagery and more generally show similarities between mental writing and actual writing. Similarities between perception and imagery are seen in both musical imagery and perception. For example relative to a visual baseline condition an imagery task is associated with increased activity in the bilateral secondary auditory cortex. This was so despite the fact that the contrast included two entirely silent conditions. Similarly a comparison of a task involving imaging a sentence being spoken in another person s voice with a visual control task reveals left temporal activation. Activation of the supplementary motor area was also seen suggesting that both input and output speech mechanisms are engaged in auditory mental imagery. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Language mapping studies are commonly divided into four categories spoken and written word recognition crossed with spoken or no spoken response. Word recognition regardless of input modality and whether or not a spoken response is required has consistently been found to activate areas 21 and 22 in the temporal cortex. In general this activation tends to be bilateral although in the category of written word recognition all activations are left lateralized. The cortical surface covered by these areas is most likely made up by several distinct regions that can be functionally dissociated. Involvement of left superior temporal gyrus Wernicke s area in word recognition is in agreement with the traditional view implicating this area in comprehension.

Whereas left temporal brain regions have been associated with word comprehension left inferior prefrontal cortex Broca s area has traditionally been linked to word production. However comparing conditions involving spoken response with conditions involving no spoken response do not suggest that left prefrontal involvement is greater when spoken responses are required. Instead the major difference between these two classes is that conditions involving spoken responses tend to activate the cerebellum to a higher extent. Broca s area is involved in word perception as well as in word production and in addition to having an output function the left prefrontal areas may participate in receptive language processing in the uninjured state. An fMRI study has shown that cerebellar activation is related to the articulatory level of speech production.

Visual areas are more frequently involved in the case of written word recognition and regardless of output spoken no spoken written word recognition tends to differentially activate left prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions. Moreover left inferior prefrontal activation has been associated with semantic processing.

A posterior left temporal region BA 37 is a multimodal language region. Both blind and sighted subjects activate this area during tactile vs. visual reading compared to non word letter strings . This area may not contain linguistic codes per se but may promote activity in other areas that jointly lead to lexical or conceptual access. Area 37 has been activated in several studies of written word recognition but not in studies of spoken word recognition. Lip reading activates the auditory cortex in the absence of auditory speech sounds. The activation was observed for silent speech as well as pseudo speech but not for nonlinguistic facial movements suggesting that lip reading modulates the perception of auditory speech at a prelexical level.

There are few differences between sign language and spoken language and sign language in bilingual persons activates a similar network as that underlying spoken language. The difference in activation in ventral temporal cortex area 37 related to sign language appears to relate to an attention mechanism that assigns importance to signing hands and facial expressions. With respect to the processing of native and foreign languages native language processing relative to processing of a foreign language selectively activates several brain regions leading to the conclusion that some brain areas are shaped by early exposure to the maternal language and that these regions may not be activated when people process a language that they have learned later in life. In Broca s area second languages acquired in adulthood are spatially separated from native languages whereas second languages acquired at an early age tend to activate overlapping regions within Broca s area. In Wernicke s area no separation based on age of language acquisition is observed. Further fMRI has been used to determine brain activity related to aspects of language processing. During phonological tasks brain activation in males was lateralized to the left inferior frontal gyrus whereas the pattern was more diffuse for females.

Activation patterns related to the processing of particular aspects of information show that a set of brain regions in the right hemisphere is selectively activated when subjects try to appreciate the moral of a story as opposed to semantic aspects of the story. Brain activation associated with syntactic complexity of sentences indicates that parts of Broca s area increase their activity when sentences increase in syntactic complexity. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Working memory consists of three main components a phonological loop for the maintenance of verbal information a visuospatial sketchpad for the maintenance of visuospatial information and a central executive for attentional control. Dozens of functional neuroimaging studies of working memory have been carried out. Working memory is associated with activations in prefrontal parietal and cingulate regions. There also may be involvement of occipital and cerebellar regions discriminations between different Brodmann s areas.

Working memory is almost always associated with increased activity in the prefrontal cortex. This activity is typically found in areas 6 44 9 and 46. Area 44 activations are more prevalent for verbal numeric tasks than for visuospatial tasks and tend to be lateralized to the left hemisphere i.e. Broca s area suggesting that they reflect phonological processing. Area 6 activations are common for verbal spatial and problem solving tasks and hence they are likely related to general working memory operations i.e. they are not material or task specific . In contrast activations in areas 9 and 46 seem to occur for certain kinds of working memory tasks but not others. Activations in these two areas tend to be more prevalent for tasks that require manipulation of working memory contents such as N back tasks than for tasks that require only uninterrupted maintenance such as delayed response tasks. Ventrolateral prefrontal regions are involved in simple short term operations whereas mid dorsal prefrontal regions perform higher level executive operations such as monitoring. Object working memory may be left lateralized while spatial working memory is right lateralized.

In addition to prefrontal activations working memory studies normally show activations in parietal regions particularly areas 7 and 40. In the case of verbal numeric tasks these activations tend to be left lateralized suggesting that they are related to linguistic operations. The phonological loop consists of a phonological store where information is briefly stored and a rehearsal process which refreshes the contents of this store. Left parietal activations may reflect the phonological store whereas left prefrontal activations in area 44 Broca s area may reflect the rehearsal process. When nonverbal materials are employed parietal activations particularly those in area 7 tend to be bilateral and to occur for spatial but not for object working memory. Thus the distinction between a ventral pathway for object processing and a dorsal pathway for spatial processing may also apply to working memory.

Working memory tasks are also associated with anterior cingulate occipital and cerebellar activations. Anterior cingulate activations are often found in Area 32 but they may not reflect working memory operations per se. Activity in dorsolateral prefrontal regions areas 9 and 46 varies as a function of delay but not of readability of a cue and activity in the anterior cingulate and in some right ventrolateral prefrontal regions varies as a function of readability but not of delay of a cue. Thus the anterior cingulate activation seems to be related to task difficulty rather than to working memory per se. Occipital activations are usually found for visuospatial tasks and may reflect increased visual attention under working memory conditions. Cerebellar activations are common during verbal working memory tasks particularly for tasks involving phonological processing e.g. holding letters and tasks that engage Broca s area left area 44 .

Consistent with the idea that mid dorsal areas 9 46 are involved in higher level working memory operations activations in these areas are prominent in the reasoning and planning tasks. Area 10 activations are also quite prevalent and may be related to episodic memory aspects of problem solving tasks see episodic memory retrieval section above . Tasks involving sequential decisions such as conceptual reasoning and card sorting consistently engage the basal ganglia thalamic and cerebellar regions. These regions are typical skill learning regions and may reflect the skill learning aspects of sequential problem solving tasks. Also the basal ganglia thalamus and prefrontal cortex are intimately linked and dysfunction of this circuitry could underlie planning deficits in Parkinson disease. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Semantic memory refers to knowledge we share with other members of our culture such as knowledge about the meaning of words e.g. a banana is a fruit the properties of objects e.g. bananas are yellow and facts e.g. bananas grow in tropical climates . Semantic memory may be divided into two testing categories categorization tasks and generation tasks. In categorization tasks subjects classify words into different categories e.g. living vs. nonliving whereas in generation tasks they produce one e.g. word stem completion or several for example fluency tasks words in response to a cue. Semantic memory retrieval is associated with activations in prefrontal temporal anterior cingulate and cerebellar regions.

Prefrontal activity during semantic memory tasks frequently found in the left hemisphere but not in the right. This is so even when the stimuli are nonverbal materials such as objects and faces. This striking left lateralization is in sharp contrast with the right lateralization of prefrontal activity typically observed during episodic memory retrieval. This asymmetric pattern has been conceptualized in terms of a hemispheric encoding retrieval asymmetry HERA model. This model consists of three hypotheses 1 the left prefrontal cortex is differentially more involved in semantic memory retrieval than is the right prefrontal cortex 2 the left prefrontal cortex is differentially more involved in encoding information into episodic memory than is the right prefrontal cortex and 3 the right prefrontal cortex is differentially more involved in episodic memory retrieval than is the left prefrontal cortex. Thus the left lateralization of prefrontal activations supports the first hypothesis of the model. The second and third hypotheses are addressed by episodic memory encoding and episodic memory retrieval testing respectively as discussed above.

Within the frontal lobes activations are found in most prefrontal regions including ventrolateral areas 45 and 47 ventromedial area 11 posterior areas 44 and 6 and mid dorsal areas 9 and 46 regions. Activations in ventrolateral regions occur during both classification and generation tasks and under a variety of conditions suggesting that they are related to generic semantic retrieval operations. In contrast area 11 activations are more common for classification than for generation tasks and could be related to a component of classification tasks such as decision making. Conversely activations in posterior and dorsal regions are more typical for generation tasks than for classification tasks. Many posterior activations areas 44 and 6 occur at or near Broca s area thus they may reflect overt or covert articulatory processes during word generation. Activations in dorsal regions areas 9 and 46 are particularly frequent for fluency tasks. Because fluency tasks require the monitoring of several items in working memory these activations may reflect working memory rather than semantic memory per se. Accordingly when subjects complete word stems areas 9 10 are more active for stems with many completions than for stems with few completions. These areas may therefore be involved in selecting among competing candidate responses.

Semantic retrieval tasks are also commonly associated with temporal anterior cingulate and cerebellar regions. Temporal activations occur mainly in the left middle temporal gyrus area 21 and in bilateral occipito temporal regions area 37 . Left area 21 is activated not only for words but also pictures and faces suggesting it is involved in higher level semantic processes that are independent of input modality. In contrast area 37 activations are more common for objects and faces so they could be related to the retrieval of visual properties of these stimuli. Anterior cingulate activations are typical for generation tasks. The anterior cingulate like the dorsal prefrontal cortex is more active for stems with many than with few completions whereas the cerebellum shows the opposite pattern. The anterior cingulate may therefore be involved in selecting among candidate responses while the cerebellum may be involved in memory search processes. Accordingly cerebellar activations are found during single word generation but not during fluency tasks.

The retrieval of animal information is associated with left occipital regions and the retrieval of tool information with left prefrontal regions. Occipital activations could reflect the processing of the subtle differences in physical features that distinguish animals whereas prefrontal activations could be related to linguistic or motor aspects of tool utilization. Animal knowledge activates a more anterior region area 21 of the inferior temporal lobe than the one associated with tool knowledge area 37 . Whereas generating color words activates fusiform areas close to color perception regions generating action words activates a left temporo occipital area close to motion perception regions. Thus knowledge about object attributes is stored close to the regions involved in perceiving these attributes. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Episodic memory refers to memory for personally experienced past events and it involves three successive stages encoding storage and retrieval. Encoding refers to processes that lead to the formation of new memory traces. Storage designates the maintenance of memory traces over time including consolidation operations that make memory traces more permanent. Retrieval refers to the process of accessing stored memory traces. Encoding and retrieval processes are amenable to functional neuroimaging research because they occur at specific points in time whereas storage consolidation processes are not because they are temporally distributed. It is very difficult to differentiate the neural correlates of encoding and retrieval on the basis of the lesion data because impaired memory performance after brain damage may reflect encoding deficits retrieval deficits or both. In contrast functional neuroimaging allows separate measures of brain activity during encoding and retrieval.

Episodic encoding can be intentional when subjects are informed about a subsequent memory test or incidental when they are not. Incidental learning occurs for example when subjects learn information while performing a semantic retrieval task such as making living nonliving decisions. Semantic memory retrieval and incidental episodic memory encoding are closely associated. Semantic processing of information semantic retrieval usually leads to successful storage of new information. Further when subjects are instructed to learn information for a subsequent memory test intentional encoding they tend to elaborate the meaning of the information and make associations on the basis of their knowledge semantic retrieval . Thus most of the regions for example left prefrontal cortex associated with semantic retrieval tasks are also associated with episodic memory encoding.

Episodic encoding is associated primarily with prefrontal cerebellar and medial temporal brain regions. In the case of verbal materials prefrontal activations are always left lateralized. This pattern contrasts with the right lateralization of prefrontal activity during episodic retrieval for the same kind of materials. In contrast encoding conditions involving nonverbal stimuli sometimes yield bilateral and right lateralized activations during encoding. Right lateralized encoding activations may reflect the use of non nameable stimuli such as unfamiliar faces and textures but encoding of non nameable stimuli has been also associated with left lateralized activations with unfamiliar faces and locations. Contrasting encoding of verbal materials with encoding of nonverbal materials may speak to the neural correlates of different materials rather than to the neural correlates of encoding per se.

The prefrontal areas most commonly activated for verbal materials are areas 44 45 and 9 46. Encoding activations in left area 45 reflects semantic processing while those in left area 44 reflects rote rehearsal. Areas 9 46 may reflect higher order working memory processes during encoding. Activation in left area 9 increases as a function of organizational processes during encoding and is attenuated by distraction during highly organizational tasks. Cerebellar activations occur only for verbal materials and show a tendency for right lateralization. The left prefrontal right cerebellum pattern during language verbal semantic memory and verbal episodic encoding tasks is consistent with the fact that fronto cerebellar connections are crossed.

Medial temporal activations are seen with episodic memory encoding and can predict not only what items will be remembered but also how well they will be remembered. Medial temporal activations show a clear lateralization pattern they are left lateralized for verbal materials and bilateral for nonverbal materials. Under similar conditions medial temporal activity is stronger during the encoding of pictures than during the encoding of words perhaps explaining why pictures are often remembered better than words. In the case of nonverbal materials medial temporal activity seems to be more pronounced for spatial than for nonspatial information consistent with the link between the hippocampus and spatial mapping shown by animal research. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Episodic memory retrieval refers to the search access and monitoring of stored information about personally experienced past events as well as to the sustained mental set underlying these processes. Episodic memory retrieval is associated with seven main regions prefrontal medial temporal medial parieto occipital lateral parietal anterior cingulate occipital and cerebellar regions.

Prefrontal activations during episodic memory retrieval are sometimes bilateral but they show a clear tendency for right lateralization. The right lateralization of prefrontal activity during episodic memory retrieval contrasts with the left lateralization of prefrontal activity during semantic memory retrieval and episodic memory encoding. Left prefrontal activations during episodic retrieval tend to occur for tasks that require more reflectively complex processing. These activations may be related to semantic retrieval processes during episodic retrieval. Semantic retrieval can aid episodic retrieval particularly during recall and bilateral activations tend to be more frequent during recall than during recognition. Moreover left prefrontal activity during episodic retrieval is associated with retrieval effort and is more common in older adults than in young adults.

Prefrontal activity changes as a function of the amount of information retrieved during the scan have been measured by varying encoding conditions e.g. deep vs. shallow or by altering the proportion of old items e.g. targets during the scan. As more information is retrieved during the scan prefrontal activity may increase retrieval success decrease retrieval effort or remain constant retrieval mode . These three outcomes are not necessarily contradictory they may correspond to three different aspects of retrieval maintaining an attentional focus on a particular past episode retrieval mode performing a demanding memory search retrieval effort and monitoring retrieved information retrieval success .

These different aspects of retrieval may map to distinct prefrontal regions. The region most strongly associated to retrieval mode is the right anterior prefrontal cortex area 10 . A combined PET ERP study associated a right area 10 activation with task related rather than item related activity during episodic retrieval. Activations associated with retrieval effort show a tendency to be left lateralized specifically in left areas 47 and 10. Bilateral Areas 10 9 and 46 are sometimes associated with retrieval success. Prefrontal activity is also seen to increase with success activations when subjects are warned about the proportion of old and new items during the scan biasing .

Medial temporal activations have been seen in the typical pattern of episodic retrieval in PET and fMRI studies for both verbal and nonverbal materials. In contrast with medial temporal activations during episodic encoding those during episodic retrieval tend to occur in both hemispheres regardless of the materials employed. That they are sometimes found in association with retrieval success but never in association with retrieval effort or retrieval mode suggest that they are related to the level of retrieval performance. Medial temporal activity increases as linear function of correct old word recognition and this activity may reflect successful access to stored memory representations. Further hippocampal activity has been associated with conscious recollection. Hippocampal activity is also sensitive to the match between study and test conditions such as the orientation of study and test objects. However recollection need not be accurate for example in the case of significant hippocampal activations during the recognition of false targets. Accurate recognition yields additional activations in a left temporoparietal region possibly reflecting the retrieval of sensory properties of auditorily studied words. Further intentional retrieval is not a precondition for hippocampal activity activations in this area are found for old information encountered during a non episodic task suggesting that they can also reflect spontaneous reminding of past events.

After the right prefrontal cortex the most typical region in PET fMRI studies of episodic retrieval is the medial parieto occipital area that includes retrosplenial primarily areas 29 and 30 precuneus primarily medial area 7 and area 31 and cuneus primarily medial areas 19 18 and 17 regions. The critical role of the retrosplenial cortex in memory retrieval is supported by evidence that lesions in this region can cause severe memory deficits e.g. retrosplenial amnesia. The role of the precuneus has been attributed to imagery and to retrieval success. Retrieval related activations in the precuneus are more pronounced for imageable than for nonimageable words. However the precuneus region was not more activated for object recall than for word recall. Imagery related activations are more anterior than activations typically associated with episodic retrieval. The precuneus is activated for both imageable and abstract words and for both visual and auditory study presentations. Thus this region appears to be involved in episodic retrieval irrespective of imagery content. The precuneus cortex is more active in a high target than in low target recognition condition.

Episodic memory retrieval is also associated with activations in lateral parietal anterior cingulate occipital and cerebellar regions. Lateral parietal regions have been associated with the processing of spatial information during episodic memory retrieval and with the perceptual component of recognition. Anterior cingulate activations areas 32 and 24 have been associated with response selection and initiation of action. Anterior cingulate activations may be related to language processes because they are more frequent for verbal than for nonverbal materials. As expected occipital activations are more common during nonverbal retrieval possibly reflecting not only more extensive processing of test stimuli but also memory related imagery operations. Cerebellar activations have been associated with self initiated retrieval operations. This idea of initiation is consistent with the association of cerebellar activations with retrieval mode and effort rather than with retrieval success.

With respect to context memory a fusiform region is more active for object identity than for location retrieval whereas an inferior parietal region shows the opposite pattern. Thus the ventral dorsal distinction applies also to episodic retrieval. In the time domain recognition memory what has been contrasted with recency memory when . Medial temporal regions are more active during item memory than during temporal order memory whereas dorsal prefrontal and parietal regions are more active during temporal order memory than during item memory. Parietal activations during temporal order memory suggest that the dorsal pathway may be associated not only with where but also with when. 

Prefrontal regions were similarly activated in both recall and recognition tests. This may signify the use of associative recognition a form of recognition with a strong recollection component or to the careful matching of task difficulty in the two tests. A comparison of free and cued recall found a dissociation in the right prefrontal cortex between dorsal cortex areas 9 and 46 which is more active during free recall and the ventrolateral cortex area 47 frontal insula which is more active during cued recall. Thus some of the activations observed during episodic memory retrieval tasks may reflect the working memory components of these tasks. Autobiographic retrieval is associated with activations along a right fronto temporal network.

Episodic memory retrieval is associated with activations in prefrontal medial temporal posterior midline parietal anterior cingulate occipital and cerebellar regions. Prefrontal activations tend to be right lateralized and have been associated with retrieval mode retrieval effort and retrieval success. The engagement of medial temporal regions has been linked to retrieval success and recollection. Posterior midline activations also seem related to retrieval success. Parietal activations may reflect processing of spatial context and anterior cingulate activations may reflect selection initiation processes. Cerebellar involvement has been attributed to self initiated retrieval. Spatial retrieval engaged parietal regions and object retrieval activated temporal regions. Parietal regions are also activated during temporal order retrieval suggesting a general role in context memory. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Priming can be divided into perceptual and conceptual priming. In several studies perceptual priming has been explored by studying completion of word stems. In the primed condition it is possible to complete the stems with previously presented words whereas this is not possible in the unprimed condition. Visual perceptual priming is associated with decreased activity in the occipital cortex. PET and fMRI studies on non verbal visual perceptual priming have revealed priming related reduction in activation of regions in the occipital and inferior temporal brain regions. Priming effects can persist over days repetition priming item specific learning as measured by fMRI shows that learning related neural changes that accompany these forms of learning partly involve the same regions.

Comparisons of blood flow responses associated with novel vs. familiar stimuli across memory tasks show that novel stimuli are associated with higher activity in several regions including fusiform gyrus and cuneus. Thus priming related reductions in activity in visual areas occur even after subliminal presentation.

Priming cannot only facilitate perceptual processes but may also influence conceptual processes. The primed condition is associated with decreased activity in several regions including the left inferior prefrontal cortex. Similarly several fMRI studies that have included repeated semantic processing of the same items have found reduced left prefrontal activation associated with the primed condition. Left prefrontal reduction of activation is not seen when words are non semantically reprocessed suggesting that the effect reflects a process specific change not a consequence of mere repeated exposure . This process specific effect can be obtained regardless of the perceptual format of the stimuli e.g. pictures or words . Many memory tests rely upon a mixture of processes and even the stem completion task which has been used in several studies of perceptual priming has been associated with priming related left prefrontal reductions. This may be taken as evidence that this task too taps both perceptual and conceptual processes.

With respect to a neural correlate of priming repeating items during performance of the same task or even during performance of different tasks can lead to decreases in the amount of activation present in specific brain areas. This effect may reflect enhanced processing of the involved neurons or and a specification of the involved neuronal population resulting in a spatially less diffuse response. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Procedural memory processes can be divided into three subcategories conditioning motor skill learning and nonmotor skill learning. With respect to conditioning studies on eye blink conditioning point to a consistent role of the cerebellum in this form of learning e.g. decreased activity in the cerebellum following conditioning . Conditioning is also associated with increased activity in the auditory cortex.

Motor skill learning is associated with activation of motor regions. Area 6 is involved and learning related changes have also repeatedly been demonstrated in the primary motor cortex area 4 . The size of the activated area in the primary motor cortex increases as a function of training. There is also parietal involvement in motor skill learning fronto parietal interactions may underlie task performance. With respect to nonmotor skill learning cerebellar activation is observed across tasks as is consistent involvement of parietal brain regions. This is in line with the pattern observed for motor skill learning and the overlap in activation patterns may reflect common processes underlying these two forms of procedural memory. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Neural correlates of preference can be detected through neuroimaging studies. For example in a simulated buying decision task between similar fast moving consumer goods only a subject s preferred brand elicited a reduced activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal posterior parietal and occipital cortices and the left premotor area Brodmann areas 9 46 7 19 and 6 and only when the target brand was the subjects favorite one. Simultaneously activity was increased in the inferior precuneus and posterior cingulated BA 7 right superior frontal gyrus BA 10 right supramarginal gyrus BA 40 and most pronounced in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex VMPFC BA 10 .

In fMRI analyses activation of the nucleus accumbens is associated with product preference and the medial prefrontal cortex is associated with evaluation of gains and losses. When these areas of the brain are activated subjects bought a product at an accuracy rate of 60 . In other fMRI analyses early stage romantic love has been associated with activation of subcortical reward regions such as the right ventral tegmental area and the dorsal caudate area. Subjects in more extended romantic love showed more activity in the ventral pallidum. In still another fMRI analysis in subjects experiencing a mistake activation of the rostral anterior cingulated cortex increased in proportion to a financial penalty linked to the mistake. See Wise Thought Police How Brain Scans Could Invade Your Private Life Popular Mechanics November 2007 .

With respect to brand discrimination brain activations in product choice differ from those for height discrimination and there is a positive relationship between brand familiarity and choice time. Neural activation during choice tasks involves brain areas responsible for silent vocalization. Decision processes take approximately 1 second as measured by magnetoencephalography and can be seen as two halves. The first period involves gender specific problem recognition processes and the second half concerns the choice itself no gender differences . MEG measurements can be categorized in four stages 

Stage 2 T temporal Neuronal activity predominantly over left anterior temporal and middle temporal cortices at approximately 325 ms after stimulus onset. Some specific activity was also found over the left frontal and right extra striate cortical areas.

Stage 3 F frontal Activation of the left inferior frontal cortices at about 510 ms after stimulus onset. These signals are consistent with activation of Broca s speech area.

Stage 4 P parietal Activation of the right posterior parietal cortices P at around 885 ms after stimulus onset.

Male brain activity differed from female in the second stage T but not in the other three stages V F and P . Left anterior temporal activity is present in both groups but males seem to activate right hemispherical regions much more strongly during memory recall than females do. As noted above response times also differed for male and female subjects. See Amber et al. Salience and Choice Neural Correlates of Shopping Decisions Psychology Marketing Vol. 21 4 pp. 247 261 April 2004 .

In an fMRI study a consistent neural response in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was associated with subjects behavioral preferences for sampled anonymized beverages. In a brand cued experiment brand knowledge of one of the beverages had a dramatic influence on expressed behavioral preferences and on the measured brain responses. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

In an fMRI study only the presence of a subject s favorite brand indicating a distinctive mode of decision making was associated with activation of regions responsible for integrating emotions. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

Various emotions may be identified through detection of brain activity. As discussed below activation of the anterior insula has been associated with pain distress and other negative emotional states. Conversely as discussed below positive emotional processes are reliably associated with a series of structures representing a reward center including the striatum and caudate and areas of the midbrain and cortex to which they project such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulated cortex as well as other areas such as the amygdala and the insula.

In addition approval and or disapproval may be determined based on brain activity. For example in an fMRI study blood oxygen level dependent signal changes were measured in subjects viewing facial displays of happiness sadness anger fear and disgust as well as neutral faces. Subjects were tasked with discriminating emotional valence positive versus negative and age over versus under 30 of the faces. During the task normal subjects showed activation in the fusiform gyrus the occipital lobe and the inferior frontal cortex relative to the resting baseline condition. The increase was greater in the amygdala and hippocampus during the emotional valence discrimination task than during the age discrimination task. See Gur et al. An fMRI study of Facial Emotion Processing in Patients with Schizophrenia Am. J. Psych. vol. 159 pp. 1992 1999 2002 .

Frustration is associated with decreased activation in the ventral striatum and increased activation in the anterior insula and the right medial prefrontal cortex by fMRI. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

fMRI has been used to show that perceived unfairness correlates with activations in the anterior insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC . Anterior insula activation is consistently seen in neuroimaging studies focusing on pain and distress hunger and thirst and autonomic arousal. Activation of the insula has also been associated with negative emotional states and activation in the anterior insula has been linked to a negative emotional response to an unfair offer indicating an important role for emotions in decision making.

In contrast to the insula region the DLPFC has been linked to cognitive processes such as goal maintenance and executive control. Thus DLPFC activation may indicate objective recognition of benefit despite an emotional perception of unfairness.

Event related hyperscan fMRI hfMRI which means that two volunteers are measured parallel in two scanners has been used to measure the neural correlates of trust. By this method the caudate nucleus has been shown to be involved in trust building and reciprocity in economic exchange. The caudate nucleus is commonly active when learning about relations between stimuli and responses. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

In a PET study sanctions against defectors were associated with activity in reward processing brain regions. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

In an fMRI study activation changes in the sublenticular extended amygdala SLEA and orbital gyrus were associated with expected values of financial gain. Responses to actual experience of rewards increased monotonically with monetary value in the nucleus accumbens SLEA and thalamus. Responses to prospective rewards and outcomes were generally but not always seen in the same regions. Overlaps with activation changes seen previously in response to tactile stimuli gustatory stimuli and euphoria indicating drugs were found. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

In another fMRI study within a group of cooperative subjects the prefrontal cortex showed activation changes when subjects playing a human compared to playing a computer. Within a group of non cooperators no significant activation changes in the prefrontal cortex were seen between computer and human conditions. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

In an fMRI study products symbolizing wealth and status were associated with increased activity in reward related brain areas. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

In a PET study participants were risk averse in gains and risk seeking in losses and ambiguity seeking in neither gains nor losses. Interactions between attitudes and beliefs were associated with neural activation changes in dorsomedial and ventromedial brain areas. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

In an fMRI study increasing monetary gains were associated with increased activity in a subcortical region of the ventral striatum in a magnitude proportional manner. This ventral striatal activation was not evident during anticipation of losses. Actual gain outcomes were associated with activation of a region of the medial prefrontal cortex. During anticipation of gain ventral striatal activation was associated with feelings characterized by increasing arousal and positive valence. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

In an fMRI study activation of parts of the limbic system were associated with decisions involving immediate rewards. Activity changes in the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex were associated with inter temporal choices. Greater relative fronto parietal activity was associated with a subject s choice of longer term options. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

The prefrontal cortex is involved in almost all high level cognitive tasks. Prefrontal activations are particularly prominent during working memory and memory retrieval episodic and semantic and less prevalent during perception and perceptual priming tasks. This pattern is consistent with the idea that the prefrontal cortex is involved in working memory processes such as monitoring organization and planning. However some of the same prefrontal regions engaged by working tasks are also recruited by simple detection tasks that do not involve a maintenance component. Thus the prefrontal cortex is not devoted solely to working memory operations.

Regarding lateralization prefrontal activations during language semantic memory retrieval and episodic memory encoding are usually left lateralized those during sustained attention and episodic retrieval are mostly right lateralized and those during working memory are typically bilateral.

With respect to distinctions between different prefrontal areas ventrolateral regions areas 45 and 47 are involved in selecting comparing or deciding on information held in short term and long term memory whereas mid dorsal regions areas 9 and 46 are involved when several pieces of information in working memory need to be monitored and manipulated. Area 45 47 activations were found even in simple language tasks while activations in areas 9 46 were associated with working memory and episodic encoding and retrieval. However areas 9 46 were also activated during sustained attention tasks which do not involve the simultaneous consideration of several pieces of information. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Humans restrain self interest with moral and social values. They are the only species known to exhibit reciprocal fairness which implies the punishment of other individuals unfair behaviors even if it hurts the punisher s economic self interest. Reciprocal fairness has been demonstrated in the Ultimatum Game where players often reject their bargaining partner s unfair offers. It has been shown that disruption of the right but not the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC by low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation substantially reduces subjects willingness to reject their partners intentionally unfair offers which suggests that subjects are less able to resist the economic temptation to accept these offers. Importantly however subjects still judge such offers as very unfair which indicates that the right DLPFC plays a key role in the implementation of fairness related behaviors. See Knoch et al. Diminishing Reciprocal Fairness by Disrupting the Right Prefrontal Cortex Science vol. 314 pp. 829 832 3 Nov. 2006 .

Differences across tasks can be found in frontopolar area 10 opercular area 44 and dorsal areas 6 and 8 prefrontal regions. Frontopolar activations were typical for episodic memory retrieval and problem solving tasks. In the case of episodic retrieval they are found for both retrieval success and retrieval mode suggesting they are probably not related to performance level or task difficulty. Area 10 is involved in maintaining the mental set of episodic retrieval but also has an involvement in problem solving tasks. Activations in left area 44 which corresponds to Broca s area were commonly found for reading verbal working memory and semantic generation. Right area 44 is engaged by nonverbal episodic retrieval tasks. Area 6 plays a role in spatial processing orientation of attention space motion perception and imagery working memory and motor skill learning. Midline area 6 activations correspond to SMA and are common for silent reading tasks. Area 8 is involved in problem solving tasks possibly reflecting eye movements. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

The frontopolar cortex has been shown to be active during the initial stages of learning gradually disengaging over the course of learning. Frontopolar cortex activity specifically correlates with the amount of uncertainty remaining between multiple putative options that subjects are simultaneously tracking. The frontopolar cortex is also active whenever subjects depart from an a priori optimal option to check alternative ones. Thus the frontopolar cortex contribution to learning and exploration appears to be associated with maintaining and switching back and forth between multiple behavioral alternatives in search of optimal behavior. The frontopolar cortex has also been implicated in memory retrieval relational reasoning and multitasking behaviors. These subfunctions are thought to be integrated in the general function of contingently switching back and forth between independent tasks by maintaining distractor resistant representations of postponed tasks during the performance of another task. For example the frontopolar cortex is specifically activated when subjects suspend execution of an ongoing task set associated with a priori the largest expected future rewards in order to explore a possibly more rewarding task set. See Keochlin et al. Anterior Prefrontal Function and the Limits of Human Decision Making Science vol. 318 pp. 594 598 26 Oct. 2007 .

Activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior paracingulate cortex indicate that a subject is thinking and acting on the beliefs of others for example either by guessing partner strategies or when comparing play with another human to play with a random device such as a computer partner. Accordingly these regions may be involved in intention detection i.e. assessing the meaning of behavior from another agent. The tempo parietal junction is also implicated in this function. Further publication brand related bias in the credibility of ambiguous news headlines is associated with activation changes in the medial prefrontal cortex. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

In situations in which people gain some useful good e.g. money juice or other incentive by using judgment activation can be observed in the so called reward areas of the brain. Therefore a feeling of approval or utility may correlate with the activation in the reward areas of the brain. Reward areas of the brain include the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal prefrontal cortex amygdala nucleus accumbens circuit. Monetary payoffs indicate activation in the nucleus accumbens. The nucleus accumbens is densely innervated by dopaminergic fibers originating from neurons in the midbrain. Sudden release of dopamine after an unexpected reward may lead to acceptance of risk. Accordingly defects in the orbitofrontal cortex amygdala nucleus accumbens reward circuit may accompany extreme risk seeking behavior. This reward system is also associated with the perception of utility of objects.

Cingulate regions can be roughly classified as anterior for example areas 32 and 24 central areas 23 and 31 and posterior posterior area 31 retrosplenial . Posterior cingulate activations are consistently seen during successful episodic memory retrieval as are other posterior midline activations e.g. medial parietal cuneus precuneus . Anterior cingulate activations occur primarily in area 32 and are consistently found for S R compatibility Stroop test working memory semantic generation and episodic memory tasks.

There are three main views of the anterior cingulate function initiation inhibitory and motor. According to the initiation view the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in attention to action that is in attentional processes required to initiate behavior. This is consistent with evidence that damage to this region sometimes produces akinetic mutism that is an almost complete lack of spontaneous motor or verbal behavior. This is also consistent with the involvement of this region in demanding cognitive tasks such as working memory and episodic retrieval.

The inhibitory view postulates that the anterior cingulate is involved in suppressing inappropriate responses. This idea accounts very well not only for its involvement in the Stroop task in which prepotent responses must be inhibited but also in working memory in which interference from previous trials must be controlled. The initiation and inhibition views are not incompatible the anterior cingulate cortex may both initiate appropriate responses and suppress inappropriate ones. Moreover these views share the idea that the anterior cingulate cortex plays an active role in cognition by controlling the operations of other regions including the prefrontal cortex.

In contrast the motor view conceptualizes the anterior cingulate as a more passive structure it receives cognitive motor commands from various regions for example prefrontal cortex and funnels them to the appropriate motor system. This view assumes that different anterior cingulate regions are engaged depending on whether responses are ocular manual or verbal. For example due to its close connections to the auditory cortex area 32 is assumed to play a role in vocalization and speech. This idea accounts for activations during tasks involving verbal materials such as Stroop semantic generation and verbal episodic retrieval tasks. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Lying is associated with increased activity in several areas of the cortex including the anterior cingulate cortex the parietal cortex and the superior frontal gyrus. See Henig Looking for the Lie New York Times http www.nytimes.com 2006 02 05 magazine 05lying.html pagewanted print 5 Feb. 2006 .

Parietal regions are consistently activated during tasks involving attention spatial perception and imagery working memory spatial episodic encoding episodic retrieval and skill learning. Medial parietal activations are frequently found during episodic memory retrieval. In general lateral parietal activations relate either to spatial perception attention or to verbal working memory storage. Parietal regions may be part of a dorsal occipito parietal pathway involved in spatial perception and or part of a posterior attention system involved in disengaging spatial attention. These spatial views account for parietal activations during spatial tasks of perception imagery and episodic encoding as well as for those during skill learning tasks which typically involve an important spatial component.

According to the working memory interpretation parietal regions are involved in the storage of verbal information in working memory. This is consistent with evidence that left posterior parietal lesions can impair verbal short term memory. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

The temporal lobes can be subdivided into four broad regions lateral insula 42 22 21 and 20 medial areas 28 34 36 and hippocampal regions posterior area 37 and polar area 38 . Area 38 is likely to have a very important role in cognition for example by linking frontal lobe and temporal lobe regions.

Lateral temporal activations are consistently found for language and semantic memory retrieval and are mostly left lateralized. Spoken word recognition tasks usually yield bilateral activations possibly reflecting the auditory component of these tasks. The involvement of the left superior and middle temporal gyrus areas 22 and 21 in language operations is consistent with research on aphasic patients. Since area 21 is also consistently activated during semantic retrieval tasks not only for verbal but also for nonverbal materials it is possible that this area reflects semantic rather than linguistic operations. This is supported by the involvement of this region in object perception.

Medial temporal lobe activations are repeatedly found for episodic memory encoding and nonverbal episodic memory retrieval. The involvement of medial temporal regions in episodic memory is consistent with lesion data. Based on PET data encoding related activations are more common in anterior hippocampal regions whereas retrieval related activations are more prevalent in posterior hippocampal regions a pattern described as the hippocampal encoding retrieval HIPER model. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

The engagement of temporo occipital regions areas 37 19 18 and 17 in cognitive tasks seems to be of two kinds activations associated with perceiving and manipulating visuospatial information and deactivations associated with perceptual priming. Visual processing along the ventral pathway is assumed to be organized hierarchically with early image analyses engaging areas close to the primary visual cortex and higher order object recognition processes involving more anterior areas. Consistent with this idea activations in areas 18 and 19 occur for most visuospatial tasks whereas activations in area 37 are associated with object processing. For example area 37 activation is found when subjects perceive objects and faces maintain images of objects in working memory and intentionally encode objects. Perception related occipital activations are enhanced by visual attention and they therefore can be expected during visual attentional tasks as well as during demanding visual skill learning tasks e.g. mirror reading .

Most activations in occipito temporal regions occur during the processing of visual information coming from eyes perception or from memory imagery and weaken when the same information is repeatedly processed priming . See Cabeza et al imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

With respect to activations in the basal ganglia the thalamus and the cerebellum basal ganglia activations were common during motor skill learning and the cerebellum was consistently activated in several different processes. Evolutionary anatomical neuropsychological and functional neuroimaging evidence indicates that the cerebellum plays an important role in cognition. The cognitive role of the cerebellum has been related as motor preparation sensory acquisition timing and attention anticipation. Each of these views can account for some cerebellar activations but not for all of them. For example the motor preparation view accounts well for activations during tasks involving motor responses such as word production and conditioning while the sensory acquisition view can accommodate activations during perceptual tasks such as smelling. The timing view accounts for activations during tasks involving relations between successive events such as conditioning and skill learning while the attention anticipation view explains activations during attention and problem solving. See Cabeza et al Imaging Cognition II An Empirical Review of 275 PET and fMRI Studies J. Cognitive Neurosci. vol. 12 pp. 1 47 2000 .

Activity in the striatum scales directly with the magnitude of monetary reward or punishment. The striatum is also involved in social decisions above and beyond a financial component. The striatum also encodes abstract rewards such as positive feeling as a result of mutual cooperation. In addition the caudate is activated in situations where a subject has an intention to trust another. Emotional processes are reliably associated with a series of structures including the striatum and caudate and areas of the midbrain and cortex to which they project such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulated cortex as well as other areas such as the amygdala and the insula. Indeed subjects with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and having associated emotional deficits are impaired in performing gambling tasks. The anterior insula is associated with increased activation as unfairness or inequity of an offer is increased. Activation of the anterior insula predicts an Ultimatum Game player s decision to either accept or reject an offer with rejections associated with significantly higher activation than acceptances. Activation of the anterior insula is also associated with physically painful distressful and or disgusting stimuli. Thus the anterior insula and associated emotion processing areas may play a role in marking an interaction as aversive and undeserving of trust in the future. See Sanfey Social Decision Making Insights from Game Theory and Neuroscience Science vol. 318 pp. 598 601 26 Oct. 2007 .

Activation in the ventral striatum is seen by fMRI when subjects provide a correct answer to a question resulting in a reward. Similarly a wrong answer and no payment results in a reduction in activity i.e. oxygenated blood flow to the ventral striatum. Moreover activation of the reward centers of the brain including the ventral striatum over and above that seen from a correct response and reward is seen when a subject receives a reward that is known to be greater than that of a peer in the study. Thus stimulation of the reward center appears to be linked not only to individual success and reward but also to the success and rewards of others.

In a multi round trust game reciprocity expressed by one player strongly predicts future trust expressed by their partner a behavioral finding mirrored by neural responses in the dorsal striatum as measured by fMRI. Analyses within and between brains show two signals one encoded by response magnitude and the other by response timing. Response magnitude correlates with the intention to trust on the next play of the game and the peak of these intention to trust responses shifts its time of occurrence by 14 seconds as player reputations develop. This temporal transfer resembles a similar shift of reward prediction errors common to reinforcement learning models but in the context of a social exchange. See King Casas et al. Getting to Know You Reputation and Trust in a Two Person Economic Exchange Science vol. 308 pp. 78 83 1 April 2005 .

Activity in the head of the caudate nucleus is associated with the processing of information about the fairness of a social partner s decision and the intention to repay with trust as measured by hyperscan fMRI. See Kenning et al. Neuroeconomics an overview from an economic perspective Brain Res. Bull. vol. 67 pp. 343 354 2005 .

Activation of the insular cortex is associated with the perception of bodily needs providing direction to motivated behaviors. For example imaging studies have shown activation of the insula in addicts with cue indicated drug craving and activation of the insular cortex has been associated with subjective reports of drug craving. See Contreras et al. Inactivation of the Interoceptive Insula Disrupts Drug Craving and Malaise Indicated by Lithium Science vol. 318 pp. 655 658 26 Oct. 2007 .

The visual cortex is located in and around the calcarine fissure in the occipital lobe. In one visual cortex study subjects were shown two patterns in quick succession. The first appeared for just 15 milliseconds too fast to be consciously perceived by the viewer. By examining fMRI images of the brain a specific image that had been flashed in front of the subjects could be identified. The information was perceived in the brain even if the subjects were not consciously aware of it. The study probed the part of the visual cortex that detects a visual stimulus but does not perceive it. It encodes visual information that the brain does not process as seen.

Activation of the hippocampus can modulate eating behaviors linked to emotional eating and lack of control in eating. Activation of brain areas known to be involved in drug craving in addicted subjects such as the orbitofrontal cortex hippocampus cerebellum and striatum suggests that similar brain circuits underlie the enhanced motivational drive for food and drugs seen in obese and drug addicted subjects. See Wang et al. Gastric stimulation in obese subjects activates the hippocampus and other regions involved in brain reward circuitry PNAS vol. 103 pp. 15641 45 2006 .

Surrogate markers of mental state may include indicators of attention approval disapproval recognition cognition memory trust or the like in response to a stimulus other than measurement of brain activity associated with the stimulus.

Examples of surrogate markers may include a skin response to a stimulus a face pattern indicative of approval disapproval or emotional state eye movements or pupil movements indicating visual attention to an object voice stress patterns indicative of a mental state or the like. Surrogate markers may be used in conjunction with brain activity measurements for higher confidence in a predictive or interpretational outcome. For example brain activation of the caudate nucleus in combination with calm voice patterns may increase confidence in a predictor of trust between a subject and a stimulus. Conversely conflict between brain activity and a surrogate marker may decrease confidence in a predictive or interpretational outcome. For example a pattern of activation of the insula diagnostic for fear together with a visual face image showing a smile may decrease the level of confidence that the subject is truly frightened by a stimulus. For example emotion links to cognition motivation memory consciousness and learning and developmental systems. Affective communication depends on complex rule based systems with multiple channels and redundancy built into the exchange system in order to compensate if one channel fails. Channels can include all five senses for example increased heart rate or sweating may show tension or agitation and can be heard seen touched smelt or tasted. Emotional exchanges may be visible displays of body tension or movement gestures posture facial expressions or use of personal space or audible displays such as tone of voice choice of pitch contour choice of words speech rate etc. Humans also use touch smell adornment fashion architecture mass media and consumer products to communicate our emotional state. Universals of emotion that cross cultural boundaries have been identified and cultural differences have also been identified. For example love is generally categorized as a positive emotion in Western societies but in certain Eastern cultures there is also a concept for sad love. Accordingly universal emotional triggers may be used to transcend cultural barriers.

When communicating with computers people often treat new media as if they were dealing with real people. They often follow complex social rules for interaction and modify their communication to suit their perceived conversation partner. Much research has focused on the use of facial actions and ways of coding them. Speech recognition systems have also attracted attention as they grow in capability and reliability and can recognize both verbal messages conveyed by spoken words and non verbal messages such as those conveyed by pitch contours.

System responses and means of expressing emotions also vary. Innovative prototypes are emerging designed to respond indirectly so the user is relatively unaware of the response for example by adaptation of material such as changing pace or simplifying or expanding content. Other systems use text voice technology visual agents or avatars to communicate. See Axelrod et al. Smoke and Mirrors Gathering User Requirements for Emerging Affective Systems 26th Int. Conf. Information Technology Interfaces TI 2004 Jun. 7 10 2004 Cavtat Croatia pp. 323 328.

Mental state may be determined by detection of a skin response associated with a stimulus. One skin response that may correlate with mental state and or brain activity is galvanic skin response GSR also known as electrodermal response EDR psychogalvanic reflex PGR or skin conductance response SCR . This is a change in the electrical resistance of the skin. There is a relationship between sympathetic nerve activity and emotional arousal although one may not be able to identify the specific emotion being elicited. The GSR is highly sensitive to emotions in some people. Fear anger startle response orienting response and sexual feelings are all among the emotions which may produce similar GSR responses. GSR is typically measured using electrodes to measure skin electrical signals.

For example an Ultimate Game study measured skin conductance responses as a surrogate marker or autonomic index for affective state and found higher skin conductance activity for unfair offers and as with insular activation in the brain this measure discriminated between acceptances and rejections of these offers. See Sanfey Social Decision Making Insights from Game Theory and Neuroscience Science vol. 318 pp. 598 601 26 Oct. 2007 . Other skin responses may include flushing blushing goose bumps sweating or the like.

Mental state may also be determined by detection of facial feature changes associated with a stimulus via pattern recognition emotion detection software face recognition software or the like.

For example an emotional social intelligence prosthetic device has been developed that consists of a camera small enough to be pinned to the side of a pair of glasses connected to a hand held computer running image recognition software plus association software that can read the emotions these images show. If the wearer seems to be failing to engage his or her listener the software makes the hand held computer vibrate. The association software can detect whether someone is agreeing disagreeing concentrating thinking unsure or interested just from a few seconds of video footage. Previous computer programs have detected the six more basic emotional states of happiness sadness anger fear surprise and disgust. The system can detect a sequence of movements beyond just a single facial expression. The association program is based on a machine learning algorithm that was trained by showing it more than 100 8 second video clips of actors expressing particular emotions. The software picks out movements of the eyebrows lips and nose and tracks head movements such as tilting nodding and shaking which it then associates with the emotion the actor was showing. When presented with fresh video clips the software gets people s emotions right 90 percent of the time when the clips are of actors and 64 percent of the time on footage of ordinary people.

In another approach an imager such as a CCD camera may observe expressed features of the user. For example the imager may monitor pupil dilation eye movement expression or a variety of other expressive indicators. Such expressive indicators may indicate a variety of emotional behavioral intentional or other aspects of the user. For example in one approach systems have been developed for identifying an emotional behavior of a person based upon selected expressive indicators. Similarly eye movement and pupil dilation may be correlated to truthfulness stress or other user characteristics.

Eye movement or pupil movement can be tested for example by measuring user pupil and or eye movements perhaps in relation to items on a display. For example a user s eye movement to a part of the screen containing an advertisement may be of interest to an advertiser for purposes of advertisement placement or determining advertising noticeability and or effectiveness within a computerized game world. For example knowing that a user s eyes have been attracted by an advertisement may be of interest to an advertiser. For example a merchant may be interested in measuring whether a user notices a virtual world avatar having particular design characteristics. If the user exhibits eye movements toward the avatar on a display then the merchant may derive a mental state from repeated eye movements vis a vis the avatar or the merchant may correlate eye movements to the avatar with other physiological activity data such as brain activation data indicating a mental state such as brand preference approval or reward.

In another embodiment a smart camera may be used that can capture images of a user s eyes process them and issue control commands within a millisecond time frame. Such smart cameras are commercially available e.g. Hamamatsu s Intelligent Vision System http jp.hamamatsu.com en product info index.html . Such image capture systems may include dedicated processing elements for each pixel image sensor. Other camera systems may include for example a pair of infrared charge coupled device cameras to continuously monitor pupil size and position as a user watches a visual target moving e.g. forward and backward. This can provide real time data relating to pupil accommodation relative to objects on a display which information may be of interest to an entity e.g. http jp.hamamatsu.com en rd publication scientific american common pdf scientific0608.pdf .

Eye movement and or pupil movement may also be measured by video based eye trackers. In these systems a camera focuses on one or both eyes and records eye movement as the viewer looks at a stimulus. Contrast may be used to locate the center of the pupil and infrared and near infrared non collumnated light may be used to create a corneal reflection. The vector between these two features can be used to compute gaze intersection with a surface after a calibration for a subject.

Two types of eye tracking techniques include bright pupil eye tracking and dark pupil eye tracking. Their difference is based on the location of the illumination source with respect to the optics. If the illumination is coaxial with the optical path then the eye acts as a retroreflector as the light reflects off the retina creating a bright pupil effect similar to red eye. If the illumination source is offset from the optical path then the pupil appears dark.

Bright Pupil tracking creates greater iris pupil contrast allowing for more robust eye tracking with all iris pigmentation and greatly reduces interference caused by eyelashes and other obscuring features. It also allows for tracking in lighting conditions ranging from total darkness to very bright light. However bright pupil techniques are not recommended for tracking outdoors as extraneous IR sources may interfere with monitoring.

Eye tracking configurations can vary in some cases the measurement apparatus may be head mounted in some cases the head should be stable e.g. stabilized with a chin rest and in some cases the eye tracking may be done remotely to automatically track the head during motion. Most eye tracking systems use a sampling rate of at least 30 Hz. Although 50 60 Hz is most common many video based eye trackers run at 240 350 or even 1000 1250 Hz which is recommended in order to capture the detail of the very rapid eye movements during reading or during studies of neurology.

Eye movements are typically divided into fixations when the eye gaze pauses in a certain position and saccades when the eye gaze moves to another position. A series of fixations and saccades is called a scanpath. Most information from the eye is made available during a fixation not during a saccade. The central one or two degrees of the visual angle the fovea provide the bulk of visual information input from larger eccentricities the periphery generally is less informative. Therefore the locations of fixations along a scanpath indicate what information loci on the stimulus were processed during an eye tracking session. On average fixations last for around 200 milliseconds during the reading of linguistic text and 350 milliseconds during the viewing of a scene. Preparing a saccade towards a new goal takes around 200 milliseconds.

Scanpaths are useful for analyzing cognitive intent interest and salience. Other biological factors some as simple as gender may affect the scanpath as well. Eye tracking in human computer interaction typically investigates the scanpath for usability purposes or as a method of input in gaze contingent displays also known as gaze based interfaces.

There are two primary components to most eye tracking studies statistical analysis and graphic rendering. These are both based mainly on eye fixations on specific elements. Statistical analyses generally sum the number of eye data observations that fall in a particular region. Commercial software packages may analyze eye tracking and show the relative probability of eye fixation on each feature on an avatar. This allows for a broad analysis of which avatar elements received attention and which ones were ignored. Other behaviors such as blinks saccades and cognitive engagement can be reported by commercial software packages. Statistical comparisons can be made to test for example competitors prototypes or subtle changes to an avatar. They can also be used to compare participants in different demographic groups. Statistical analyses may quantify where users look sometimes directly and sometimes based on models of higher order phenomena e.g. cognitive engagement .

In addition to statistical analysis it is often useful to provide visual depictions of eye tracking results. One method is to create a video of an eye tracking testing session with the gaze of a participant superimposed upon it. This allows one to effectively see through the eyes of the consumer during interaction with a target medium. Another method graphically depicts the scanpath of a single participant during a given time interval. Analysis may show each fixation and eye movement of a participant during a search on a virtual shelf display of breakfast cereals analyzed and rendered with a commercial software package. For example a different color may represent one second of viewing time allowing for a determination of the order in which products are seen. Analyses such as these may be used as evidence of specific trends in visual behavior.

A similar method sums the eye data of multiple participants during a given time interval as a heat map. A heat map may be produced by a commercial software package and shows the density of eye fixations for several participants superimposed on the original stimulus for example an avatar on a magazine cover. Red and orange spots represent areas with high densities of eye fixations. This allows one to examine which regions attract the focus of the viewer.

Commercial eye tracking applications include web usability advertising sponsorship package design and automotive engineering. Eye tracking studies may presenting a target stimulus to a sample of consumers while an eye tracker is used to record the activity of the eye. Examples of target stimuli may include avatars in the context of websites television programs sporting events films commercials magazines newspapers packages shelf displays consumer systems ATMs checkout systems kiosks and software. The resulting data can be statistically analyzed and graphically rendered to provide evidence of specific visual patterns. By examining fixations saccades pupil dilation blinks and a variety of other behaviors researchers can determine a great deal about the effectiveness of a given avatar in a given medium or associated with a given product.

A prominent field of eye tracking research is web usability. While traditional usability techniques are often quite powerful in providing information on clicking and scrolling patterns eye tracking offers the ability to analyze user interaction between the clicks. This provides insight into which features are the most eye catching which features cause confusion and which ones are ignored altogether. Specifically eye tracking can be used to assess impressions of an avatar in the context of search efficiency branding online advertisement navigation usability overall design and or many other site components. Analyses may target an avatar on a prototype or competitor site in addition to the main client site.

Eye tracking is commonly used in a variety of different advertising media. Commercials print ads online ads and sponsored programs are all conducive to analysis with eye tracking technology. Analyses may focus on visibility of a target avatar product or logo in the context of a magazine newspaper website virtual world or televised event. This allows researchers to assess in great detail how often a sample of consumers fixates on the target avatar logo product or advertisement. In this way an advertiser can quantify the success of a given campaign in terms of actual visual attention.

Eye tracking also provides avatar designers with the opportunity to examine the visual behavior of a consumer while interacting with a target avatar. This may be used to analyze distinctiveness attractiveness and the tendency of the avatar to be chosen for recognition and or purchase. Eye tracking can be used while the target avatar is in the prototype stage. Prototype avatars can be are tested against each other and against competitors to examine which specific elements are associated with high visibility and or appeal.

Another application of eye tracking research is in the field of automotive design. Eye tracking cameras may be integrated into automobiles to provide the vehicle with the capacity to assess in real time the visual behavior of the driver. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA estimates that drowsiness is the primary causal factor in 100 000 police reported accidents per year. Another NHTSA study suggests that 80 of collisions occur within three seconds of a distraction. By equipping automobiles with the ability to monitor drowsiness inattention and cognitive engagement driving safety could be dramatically enhanced. Lexus claims to have equipped its LS 460 automobile with the first driver monitor system in 2006 providing a warning if the driver takes his or her eye off the road.

Eye tracking is also used in communication systems for disabled persons allowing the user to speak mail surf the web and so on with only the eyes as tool. Eye control works even when the user has involuntary body movement as a result of cerebral palsy or other disability and or when the user wears glasses.

An example of a measure of pupil movement may be an assessment of the size and symmetry of a user s pupils before and after a stimulus such as light or focal point. In one embodiment where the user interacts with a head mounted display the display may include image capturing features that may provide information regarding expressive indicators. Such approaches have been described in scanned beam display systems such as those found in U.S. Pat. No. 6 560 028.

Voice stress analysis VSA technology records psycho physiological stress responses that are present in the human voice when a person experiences a psychological stress in response to a stimulus. Psychological stress may be detected as acoustic modifications in the fundamental frequency of a speaker s voice relative to normal frequency modulation of the vocal signal between 8 14 Hz during speech in an emotionally neutral situation. In situations involving a stress response the 8 14 Hz modulation may decrease as the muscles surrounding the vocal cords contract in response to the reaction.

VSA typically records an inaudible component of human voice commonly referred to as the Lippold Tremor. Under normal circumstances the laryngeal muscles are relaxed producing recorded voice at approximately 12 Hz. Under stress however the tensed laryngeal muscles produce voice significantly lower than normal. The higher the stress the lower down the Hertz scale voice waves are produced. One application for VSA is in the detection of deception.

Dektor Counterintelligence manufactured the PSE 1000 an analog machine that was later replaced by the PSE 2000. The National Institute Of Truth Verification NITV then produced and marketed a digital application based on the McQuiston Ford algorithm. The primary commercial suppliers are Dektor PSE5128 software Diogenes Lantern software NITV CVSA Software and Baker Baker software .

VSA is distinctly different from LVA Layered Voice Analysis . LVA is used to measure different components of voice such as pitch and tone. LVA is available in the form of hand held devices and software. LVA produces readings such as love excitement and fear.

One example of a commercially available layered voice analysis system is the SENSE system sold by Nemesysco Ltd Natania Israel . SENSE can analyze different layers within the voice using multiple parameters to analyze each speech segment. SENSE can detect various cognitive states such as whether a subject is excited confused stressed concentrating anticipating a response or unwillingly sharing information. The technology also can provide an in depth view of the subject s range of emotions including those relating to love. SENSE technology can be further utilized to identify psychological issues mental illness and other behavioral patterns. The LVA technology is the security version of the SENSE technology adapted to identify the emotional situations a subject is expected to have during formal security investigations.

1. The vocal waveform is analyzed to measure the presence of local micro high frequencies low frequencies and changes in their presence within a single voice sample.

3. The parameters gathered by the previous steps are used to create a baseline profile for the subject.

4. The new voice segments to be tested are compared with the subject s baseline profile and the analysis is generated.

This input can be further processed by statistical learning algorithms to predict the probability of a deceptive or fraudulent sentence in a subject s speech. Another layer that is used in certain applications evaluates the conversation as a whole and produces a final risk or QA value.

Excitement Level Each of us becomes excited or depressed from time to time. SENSE compares the presence of the Micro High frequencies of each sample to the basic profile to measure the excitement level in each vocal segment.

Confusion Level Is your subject sure about what he or she is saying SENSE technology measures and compares the tiny delays in a subject s voice to assess how certain he or she is.

Stress Level Stress may include the body s reaction to a threat either by fighting the threat or by fleeing. However during a spoken conversation neither option may be available. The conflict caused by this dissonance affects the micro low frequencies in the voice during speech.

Anticipation Level Is your subject anticipating your responses according to what he or she is telling you 

Embarrassment Level Is your subject feeling comfortable or does he feel some level of embarrassment regarding what he or she is saying 

Arousal Level What triggers arousal in the subject Is he or she interested in an object Aroused by certain visual stimuli 

SENSE s Deep Technology Is a subject thinking about a single topic when speaking or are there several layers to a response e.g. background issues something that may be bothering him or her planning or the like . SENSE technology can detect brain activity operating at a pre conscious level.

The speaking mechanism is one of the most complicated procedures the human body is capable of. First the brain has to decide what should be said then air is pushed from the lungs upward to the vocal cords that must vibrate to produce the main frequency. Now the vibrated air arrives to the mouth.

The tongue the lips the teeth and the nose space turns the vibrated air into the sounds that we recognize as phrases. The brain is closely monitoring all these events and listens to what comes out if we speak too softly too loudly and if it is understandable to a listener. SENSE Technology ignores what your subject is saying and focuses only on what the brain is broadcasting.

Humans unlike other mammals are capable of predicting or imagining the future. Most people can tell whether or not a certain response will cause them pleasure or pain. Lying is not a feeling it is a tool. The feeling structure around it will be the one causing us to lie and understanding the differences is crucial for making an analysis.

1. Jokes Jokes are not so much lies as they are untruths used to entertain. No long gain profit or loss will be earned from it and usually little or no extra feelings will be involved.

2. White Lies You know you don t want to say the truth as it may hurt someone else. White lies are lies but the teller usually experiences little stress or guilt.

3. Embarrassment Lies Same as for white lies but this time directed internally. Nothing will be lost except the respect of the listener most likely for the short term.

4. Offensive Lies This is a unique lie for it s intention is to gain something extra that could not be gained otherwise.

The SENSE technology IS the old Truster technology with several additions and improvements. The old Truster was all about emotions in the context of Truth Lie SENSE looks at emotions in general.

When people get sexually aroused or feel in love the pupils get wider the lips get reddish the skin of the face gets red. The voice changes too. Increased excitement makes the whole voice higher and more concentrated. The SENSE technology can detect the increased excitement and the associated heightened concentration and anticipation.

While each of the above described approaches to providing expressive indicators has been described independently in some approaches a combination of two or more of the above described approaches may be implemented to provide additional information that may be useful in evaluating user behavior and or mental state.

After a start operation operation depicts presenting at least one characteristic to at least one member of a population cohort. For example an attribute specification unit can transmit a characteristic for display to a member of population cohort on a presentation unit and or display . Optionally a presented avatar characteristic may be encountered during an interaction of the member of population cohort with a virtual world alternatively the characteristic may be one presented in a real world context for subsequent incorporation into an avatar. In one embodiment a clothing specification unit can present a photograph of a particular item of clothing independent of an avatar via mobile display . In another embodiment a facial attribute specification unit can present an eye shape and color to a member of population cohort in the context of an avatar in an online game via a desktop display .

For example a device attribute specification unit and or presentation unit may present at least one characteristic to at least one member of a population cohort . In one embodiment a body attribute specification unit may communicate via a network for example with a presentation device to present a characteristic to member of population cohort . A population cohort may include an ad hoc population cohort or an established population cohort such as an age defined demographic group.

In another embodiment a speech specification unit of the device may present a speech characteristic such as accent dialect tone or pitch to a member of population cohort via for example a personal communication device such as a video capable cellular phone. For example the attribute specification unit may initiate the presentation of an avatar with a particular characteristic such as a hair color or hair style to a member of population cohort in response to the member of population cohort signing on to a social networking website. The presentation may be through for example a widget on the social networking website.

It should be understood that characteristics may be profitably combined to provide feedback about composite features of presented attributes and or avatars. For example an attribute specification unit may present a composite voice facial attribute clothing attribute and body attribute characteristic to a member of population cohort via an online shopping experience such as a virtual personal shopper.

Verbal attributes or characteristics may be presented such as foreign language or accented speech such as a southern accent a Boston accent a Spanish accent a British accent or the like. Such voice variations may be computer detectable and or computer implemented. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 7 263 489 Detection of characteristics of human machine interactions for dialog customization and analysis. Prosodic features of speech such as intonation stress and other paralinguistic features of speech such as voice quality emotion and speaking style may also be presented as characteristic.

A characteristic may also include paralanguage a.k.a. vocalics which involves nonverbal cues of the voice. Various acoustic properties of speech such as tone pitch accent or the like collectively known as prosody can be presented as nonverbal characteristics. Paralanguage may be used to present a characteristic as well as voice qualities including volume pitch tempo rhythm articulation resonance nasality and or accent. Vocalization cues also may be presented as the characteristic including emotions expressed during or associated with speech such as laughing crying and or yawning. Vocalization cues also may include delivery nuances such as volume and or pitch modulation such as whispering and shouting. Vocalization cues also may include vocal segregates such as um in between spoken expressions or uh huh like no way or other phrase in response to another s speech to indicate comprehension to punctuate speech and or to manage contact during dialogue. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 356 868 Voiceprint identification system. 

Alternatively a non verbal attribute or characteristic including physical appearance and or non verbal communication may be presented. For example body language such as use of American Sign Language may be presented as the characteristic.

Non verbal communication characteristics may also include for example a facial expression a gesture a gaze and or a posture. A characteristic may also include clothing hairstyle adornment shoes and or other communicative props or even architecture a symbol and or an infographic.

Kinesic behaviors such as body movements facial expressions and gestures may also be presented characteristics. Kinesic behaviors may include mutual gaze smiling facial warmth or pleasantness childlike behaviors direct body orientation and the like. An attribute specification unit and or presentation unit can present a movement characteristic such as a kineme which is a unit of visual expression analogous to a phoneme a unit of speech. Presentable gestures may include emblems illustrators affect displays regulators and or adaptors. An emblem is a gesture with a direct verbal translation such as a wave of the hand an illustrator is a gesture that depicts a concept that is substantially simultaneously spoken such as turning an imaginary steering wheel while speaking about driving an affect display is a gesture that conveys emotions such as a smile or a frown a regulator is a gesture that controls interaction such as a shhh sign placing an index finger vertically at the center of the lips and finally an adaptor is a gesture that facilitates release of body tension such as quick repetitive leg movements or stretching.

A presented characteristic may also include an advertising symbol and or a brand name design symbol or logo e.g. trademarks of corporations such as a Bic pen a Rolex watch a McDonald s restaurant a Hermes scarf a Louis Vuitton bag or a Les Paul guitar . Service marks may also be presented as a characteristic.

A presented characteristic may also include for example a characteristic that is not typically presented in the context of an avatar and or a characteristic that an avatar cannot have.

Operation depicts measuring at least one physiologic activity of the at least one member of the population cohort the at least one physiologic activity proximate to the at least one characteristic. For example a physiologic activity measurement unit brain activity measurement unit and or surrogate marker measurement unit may measure at least one physiologic activity of the at least one member of the population cohort the at least one physiologic activity proximate to the at least one characteristic. For example during presentation of the characteristic to the member of the population cohort a fNIR module may detect brain activity in the member of the population cohort indicative of approval of the characteristic. Of course other measurement methods may be used including fMRI MEG EEG singly or in combination. Optionally surrogate markers of brain activity may be employed to detect physiologic activity such as a voice response to a characteristic an eye movement response to an object a skin response to an object or the like. Detected brain activity may be proximate in time to presentation and or viewing of the characteristic by the member of the population cohort as determined by one or more of brain activity indicative of visual activity e.g. activity in the visual cortex selective attention e.g. activity in fronto parietal areas and or perception e.g. activity in the ventral pathway . Detected physiologic activity may be determined to be proximate in time using an eye movement or gaze tracking measurement to identify times when a member of the population cohort looks at a characteristic. In one embodiment eye movement or gaze tracking data may be matched with a time course of brain activity to associate a particular brain area activation with visual contact of the member of the population cohort with a presented characteristic.

As used herein the term proximate may refer to proximate in time for example a physiologic measurement that is proximate in time to a presentation of a characteristic to a member of population cohort and or member of population .

In another embodiment eye movement or gaze tracking data may be matched with a time course of voice response skin response or other surrogate marker of brain activity to associate a particular physiologic activity with visual contact of the member of the population cohort with a presented characteristic.

In the context of storing physiologic activity measurement data it should be understood that a data signal may first be encoded and or represented in digital form i.e. as digital data prior to an assignment to at least one memory. For example a digitally encoded representation of user eye movement data may be stored in a local memory or may be transmitted for storage in a remote memory.

Thus an operation may be performed relating either to a local or remote storage of the digital data or to another type of transmission of the digital data. Of course as discussed herein operations also may be performed relating to accessing querying processing recalling or otherwise obtaining the digital data from a memory including for example transmission of the digital data from a remote memory. Accordingly such operation s may involve elements including at least an operator e.g. either human or computer directing the operation a transmitting computer and or a receiving computer and should be understood to occur within the United States as long as at least one of these elements resides in the United States.

Operation depicts associating the at least one physiological activity with at least one mental state. For example a device and or association unit may associate the at least one physiologic activity with at least one mental state. For example association unit may associate approval with a pattern of activation of the reward center including for example the striatum and caudate and areas of the midbrain and cortex to which they project such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulated cortex. In one embodiment an association unit may search a database of functional brain mapping that contains information about which brain regions are associated with particular mental states and or functions. Such a database search may be keyed to brain activation pattern and or to mental state and or function. For example an association unit may search measured brain activation information and or surrogate marker information for data consistent with trust. For example a measured activation of a region of the brain associated with trust such as the caudate nucleus may be associated with trust as the at least one mental state. Alternatively or in addition measurement of a surrogate marker such as an approving voice response proximate to the at least one characteristic may be associated with approval as the at least one mental state by an association unit .

Operation depicts specifying at least one avatar attribute based on the at least one mental state. For example a device and or attribute specification unit may specify at least one avatar attribute based on the at least one mental state. For example a device and or attribute specification unit may specify at least one facial feature or facial dimension as an avatar attribute for use in an avatar based on an approving mental state identified in association with a measured physiologic activity proximate to a presented characteristic. In one embodiment an association of a characteristic with a high degree of attention on the part of a member of population cohort may provide the basis for an attribute specification unit to specify the characteristic as an attribute for incorporation into a cohort linked avatar.

In another embodiment a voice specification unit may specify a particular tonal quality of voice as the at least one avatar attribute based on an association between the tonal voice quality and a positive emotional response as measured by a brain activity measurement unit and or a surrogate marker measurement unit and as associated by association unit . In another embodiment a non verbal specification unit may specify an object as an avatar attribute based on a positive mental state associated with the object by emotion association module for example.

In another embodiment an attribute specification unit may specify an attribute that is a variant of the initially presented characteristic that provided the basis for the identification of mental state. In this case specification of the variant of the characteristic may allow the system to titrate the reactions of a member of population cohort among various flavors of an attribute. For example the system may be used to explore reactions of a member of population cohort to various hairstyles of an avatar. Accordingly a short hairstyle may be presented brain activity may be measured proximate to the presentation of the short hairstyle a positive emotional reaction may be associated with the brain activity and based on the positive emotional mental state a body attribute specification unit may specify a medium hairstyle as an avatar attribute for subsequent presentation to the member of population cohort . As the process repeats differential reactions indicating preference approval and or disapproval of the member of population cohort for variations on the attribute will emerge to suggest a most preferred attribute for an avatar.

Accordingly in one embodiment an attribute specification unit may send an avatar attribute and or other avatar output to a presentation device for subsequent presentation to a member of population cohort . The process may be repeated reiteratively as a means of refining an avatar to include characteristics or attributes that are linked to a cohort in terms of preference or other mental state eliciting quality.

In some embodiments an avatar attribute may include for example an attribute of a three dimensional model an attribute of a two dimensional icon or image an attribute of a text construct an attribute of an audio construct and or an attribute of a personality connected with a screen name. An avatar attribute may include an attribute of a real world object. In other embodiments an avatar attribute may include for example an attribute of an embodiment as of a quality or a concept. In another example an avatar attribute may include an attribute of an archetype. In another embodiment an avatar attribute may include a manifestation or aspect of a continuing entity not necessarily a person. For example a manifestation or aspect of a corporation may be an avatar attribute as may be a specification for a class of robots. Accordingly a specified avatar attribute may be an overall representation of what is happening in the population cohort with respect to a presented characteristic. Other examples of an avatar attribute are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

Operation depicts presenting the at least one characteristic to the at least one member of a population cohort the at least one characteristic associated with the at least one member of the population cohort. For example an attribute specification unit presentation device presentation unit and or device may present at least one characteristic to at least one member of a population cohort the at least one characteristic associated with the at least one member of the population cohort . For example if the member of the population cohort has brown hair and brown eyes an attribute specification unit may present an avatar with brown hair and brown eyes to the member of population cohort via presentation unit .

In another embodiment a clothing specification unit may specify a particular color and or style of clothing that matches the clothing of the at least one member of a population cohort for presentation to the at least one member of a population cohort . Similarly a speech specification unit may present a particular speech attribute such as a low pitch in an instance where the at least one member of a population cohort is determined to have a low pitched voice.

Operation depicts presenting the at least one characteristic to the at least one member of a population cohort the at least one characteristic not associated with a member of the population cohort. For example an attribute specification unit presentation device presentation unit and or device may present at least one characteristic to at least one member of a population cohort the at least one characteristic not associated with the at least one member of the population cohort . For example if the member of the population cohort has short curly hair an attribute specification unit may present an avatar with long straight hair to the member of population cohort via presentation unit .

In another embodiment a clothing specification unit may specify a particular color and or style of clothing that contrasts with the clothing of the at least one member of a population cohort for presentation to the at least one member of a population cohort . Similarly a speech specification unit may present a particular speech attribute such as a low pitch in an instance where the at least one member of a population cohort is determined to have a high pitched voice. Such contrasting characteristic presentations may elicit interesting mental state responses particularly in cases where gender opposite characteristics such as the voice pitch example above are found to elicit favorable physiologic responses in the member of a population cohort .

Operation depicts presenting at least one characteristic to at least one member of a established population cohort. For example an attribute specification unit presentation device presentation unit and or device may present at least one characteristic to at least one member of a established population cohort. For example an attribute specification unit may present an avatar wearing Hello Kitty brand clothing as the at least one characteristic to a member of a demographic group including girls ages 6 10 as the established population cohort. Alternatively a speech specification unit may present an avatar that speaks with a British accent as the at least one characteristic to a demographic group including people living in Britain as the established population cohort. In another embodiment a facial attribute specification unit may present an avatar that includes a heavy beard as the at least one characteristic to a male demographic as the established population cohort.

Operation depicts presenting the at least one characteristic to at least one member of a established age cohort. For example an attribute specification unit presentation device presentation unit and or device may present at least one characteristic to at least one member of a established age cohort. For example an attribute specification unit may present an avatar wearing Van Dutch brand clothing as the at least one characteristic to a member of a demographic group including women aged 18 24 as the established age cohort. Alternatively a speech specification unit may present an avatar that speaks with a British accent as the at least one characteristic to a demographic group including British people aged 45 65 as the established age cohort.

In another embodiment a facial attribute specification unit may present an avatar that includes an approximation of Jennifer Aniston s nose as the at least one characteristic to an age demographic between 18 24 years of age as the established age cohort.

Operation depicts presenting the at least one characteristic to at least one member of a established gender cohort. For example an attribute specification unit presentation device presentation unit and or device may present at least one characteristic to at least one member of a established gender cohort. For example an attribute specification unit may present an avatar having an Oprah like appearance as the at least one characteristic to a member of a demographic group including women as the established gender cohort. Alternatively a speech specification unit may present an avatar that speaks with a lilting tone as the at least one characteristic to a demographic group including men as the established gender cohort. In another embodiment a body attribute specification unit may present an avatar that includes a body builder s physique as the at least one characteristic to at least one member of a male cohort as the established gender cohort.

Operation depicts presenting the at least one characteristic to at least one member of a established ethnic cohort. For example an attribute specification unit presentation device presentation unit and or device may present at least one characteristic to at least one member of a established ethnic cohort perhaps via a presentation unit . For example an attribute specification unit may present an image including for example plaid clothing or a bagpipe as the at least one characteristic to a member of an ethnic group including Scotsmen as the established ethnic cohort. Alternatively a speech specification unit may present an avatar that speaks with a southern drawl as the at least one characteristic to a member of an ethnic group including inhabitants of northern states as the established gender cohort. In another embodiment a facial attribute specification unit may present a sun tanned face as the at least one characteristic to at least one member of a Canadian cohort as the established ethnic cohort.

A number of methods of identifying ethnicity based on facial features are known in the art for example ethnicity identification may be formulated as a two category classification problem for example to classify the subject as an Asian or non Asian. The input images may be resized to different scales. At each scale a classic appearance based face recognizer based on a linear discriminant analysis representation may be developed under a Bayesian statistical decision framework. An ensemble may then be constructed by integrating classification results to arrive at a final decision. The product rule may be used as an integration strategy. See Lu et al. Ethnicity Identification from Face Images Biometric Technology for Human Identification Eds. Jain et al. Proc. SPIE Vol. 5404 pp. 114 123 2004 .

Subject ethnicity identification may be based on a number of factors including skin and or hair characteristics associated with ethnicity such as red hair among Caucasians voice and or speech associated with ethnicity such as French accented English indicating French or French Canadian ethnicity face pattern associated with ethnicity such as eye shape nose shape face shape or the like and eye attributes such as blue eyes among Caucasians. In one embodiment Gabor wavelets transformation and retina sampling from physiologic measurement data may be combined to extract key facial features and support vector machines may be used for ethnicity classification. An experimental system has used Gabor wavelets transformation and retina sampling in combination to extract key facial features and support vector machines were used for ethnicity classification resulting in approximately 94 success for ethnicity estimation under various lighting conditions. See Hosoi et al. Ethnicity estimation with facial images Sixth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition pp. 195 200 2004 . Of course other methods of ethnicity identification known in the art may be used.

An age gender and or ethnicity characteristic may be based on for example an iris pattern associated with an asian user.

Such measurements may include for example an increase in heart rate over a time interval as measured by a heart rate monitor embedded in a user interface increased eye movements as measured by an image capture device such as a video camera or changes in the galvanic skin response as measured by electrodes embedded in a user interface or included in device .

In one embodiment an iris response module and or gaze tracking module may acquire data from a user monitoring device such as a video capture device or a video communication device for example when a subject s image is captured as a photograph or video when using an application such as a webcam or when a subject s image is captured when communicating via a photography or video based application. Other sources of image data may include biometric data such as facial pattern data eye scanning data or the like. Such image data may indicate for example alertness attention approval disapproval or the like as discussed below.

Image data may include results of visual spectrum imaging that can image changes in facial expression body movement or the like that can be indicative of a physiological activity brain activity and or mental state. User image data may also be obtained from other kinds of imaging such as infrared imaging that can read a heat signature and or ultrasound imaging. Further reflected image or refracted image data may also be obtained by physiologic activity measurement unit and or surrogate marker measurement unit . Near infrared imaging may be used to test for baseline physiologic states and metabolism as well as physiologic and metabolic changes. Image data may be of all or a portion of a member of population cohort such as a head to toe image a face image an image of fingers an image of an eye or the like. Such images may be in the visual or non visual wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Interest in the advertisement as the presented characteristic in the form of face pattern data e.g. a smile on an image of the subject s face pointing device manipulation data e.g. a mouse click on an onscreen advertisement icon as the presented characteristic and or eye movement data e.g. repeated eye movements toward the advertisement as the presented characteristic or the like.

Operation depicts measuring the at least one brain activity surrogate marker of the at least one member of the population cohort using at least one of iris dilation or constriction gaze tracking skin response or voice response the at least one brain activity surrogate marker proximate to the at least one characteristic. For example the device physiologic activity measurement unit surrogate marker measurement unit iris response module gaze tracking module skin response module and or voice response module can measure the at least one brain activity surrogate marker of the at least one member of the population cohort using at least one of iris dilation or constriction gaze tracking skin response or voice response the at least one brain activity surrogate marker proximate to the at least one presented characteristic.

Such measurements may include for example as discussed above layered voice analysis voice stress analysis or the like.

The reaction of a subject to a presented characteristic such as an advertisement in a computerized game world or in another virtual world may be a recognizable vocal exclamation such as Wow that s nice that may be detectable by a voice response module such as a microphone monitoring an interaction between the subject and for example a presentation device and or device . A voice response module may also include a speech recognition function such as a software program or computational device that can identify and or record an utterance of a subject as speech or voice data.

In another embodiment an iris response module may record changes in the movement of a subject s iris with corresponding changes in the size of the pupil before during and or after presentation of a characteristic to a member of a population cohort . Such measurements of physiologic activity that indicate brain activity and or mental state may be carried out at a time that is proximate to presentation of a characteristic to a member of population cohort .

In one embodiment a gaze tracking module may include a camera that can monitor a subject s eye movements in order to determine whether the subject looks at a presented characteristic for example during a certain time period.

Gaze tracking module and or iris response module may include a smart camera that can capture images process them and issue control commands within a millisecond time frame. Such smart cameras are commercially available e.g. Hamamatsu s Intelligent Vision System http ip.hamamatsu.com en product info index.html . Such image capture systems may include dedicated processing elements for each pixel image sensor. Other camera systems may include for example a pair of infrared charge coupled device cameras to continuously monitor pupil size and position as a user watches a visual target moving forward and backward. This can provide real time data relating to pupil accommodation relative to objects on for example a display . e.g. http ip.hamamatsu.com en rd publication scientific american common pdf scientific0608.pdf .

Eye movement and or iris movement may also be measured by video based eye trackers. In these systems a camera focuses on one or both eyes and records eye movement as the viewer looks at a stimulus. Contrast may be used to locate the center of the pupil and infrared and near infrared non collumnated light may be used to create a corneal reflection. The vector between these two features can be used to compute gaze intersection with a surface after a calibration for an user .

Two types of gaze tracking or eye tracking techniques include bright pupil eye tracking and dark pupil eye tracking. Their difference is based on the location of the illumination source with respect to the optics. If the illumination is coaxial with the optical path then the eye acts as a retroreflector as the light reflects off the retina creating a bright pupil effect similar to red eye. If the illumination source is offset from the optical path then the pupil appears dark.

Bright Pupil tracking creates greater iris pupil contrast allowing for more robust eye tracking with all iris pigmentation and greatly reduces interference caused by eyelashes and other obscuring features. It also allows for tracking in lighting conditions ranging from total darkness to very bright light. However bright pupil techniques are not recommended for tracking outdoors as extraneous IR sources may interfere with monitoring.

Eye tracking configurations can vary in some cases the measurement apparatus may be head mounted in some cases the head should be stable e.g. stabilized with a chin rest and in some cases the eye tracking may be done remotely to automatically track the head during motion. Most eye tracking systems use a sampling rate of at least 30 Hz. Although 50 60 Hz is most common many video based eye trackers run at 240 350 or even 1000 1250 Hz which is recommended in order to capture the detail of the very rapid eye movements during reading or during studies of neurology.

Eye movements are typically divided into fixations when the eye gaze pauses in a certain position and saccades when the eye gaze moves to another position. A series of fixations and saccades is called a scanpath. Most information from the eye is made available during a fixation not during a saccade. The central one or two degrees of the visual angle the fovea provide the bulk of visual information input from larger eccentricities the periphery generally is less informative. Therefore the locations of fixations along a scanpath indicate what information loci on the stimulus were processed during an eye tracking session. On average fixations last for around 200 milliseconds during the reading of linguistic text and 350 milliseconds during the viewing of a scene. Preparing a saccade towards a new goal takes around 200 milliseconds.

Scanpaths are useful for analyzing cognitive intent interest and salience. Other biological factors some as simple as gender may affect the scanpath as well. Eye tracking in human computer interaction typically investigates the scanpath for usability purposes or as a method of input in gaze contingent displays also known as gaze based interfaces.

There are two primary components to most eye tracking studies statistical analysis and graphic rendering. These are both based mainly on eye fixations on specific elements. Statistical analyses generally sum the number of eye data observations that fall in a particular region. Commercial software packages may analyze eye tracking and show the relative probability of eye fixation on each feature in a website. This allows for a broad analysis of which site elements received attention and which ones were ignored. Other behaviors such as blinks saccades and cognitive engagement can be reported by commercial software packages. Statistical comparisons can be made to test for example competitors prototypes or subtle changes to an avatar and or web design. They can also be used to compare participants in different demographic groups and or population cohorts. Statistical analyses may quantify where subjects look sometimes directly and sometimes based on models of higher order phenomena e.g. cognitive engagement .

In addition to statistical analysis it is often useful to provide visual depictions of eye tracking results. One method is to create a video of an eye tracking testing session with the gaze of a participant superimposed upon it. This allows one to effectively see through the eyes of the subject during interaction with a presented characteristic. Another method graphically depicts the scanpath of a single participant during a given time interval. Analysis may show each fixation and eye movement of a participant during a search on a virtual shelf display of breakfast cereals analyzed and rendered with a commercial software package. For example a different color may represent one second of viewing time allowing for a determination of the order in which products are seen. Analyses such as these may be used as evidence of specific trends in visual behavior.

A similar method sums the eye data of multiple participants during a given time interval as a heat map. A heat map may be produced by a commercial software package and shows the density of eye fixations for several participants superimposed on the original stimulus for example a magazine cover. Red and orange spots represent areas with high densities of eye fixations. This allows one to examine which regions attract the attention and focus of the viewer.

Commercial eye tracking applications include web usability advertising sponsorship package design and automotive engineering. Eye tracking studies often present a target stimulus to a sample of consumers while an eye tracker is used to record the activity of the eye. Examples of target stimuli may include websites television programs sporting events films commercials magazines newspapers packages shelf displays consumer systems e.g. ATMs checkout systems kiosks and software. The resulting data can be statistically analyzed and graphically rendered to provide evidence of specific visual patterns. By examining fixations saccades pupil dilation blinks and a variety of other behaviors researchers can determine a great deal about the effectiveness of a given medium or product.

A prominent field of eye tracking research is web usability. While traditional usability techniques are often quite powerful in providing information on clicking and scrolling patterns eye tracking offers the ability to analyze user interaction between the clicks. This provides insight into which features are the most eye catching which features cause confusion and which ones are ignored altogether. Specifically eye tracking can be used to assess search efficiency branding online advertisement navigation usability overall design and many other site components including avatar attributes. Analyses may target a prototype avatar or competitor avatars in addition to the main avatar.

Eye tracking is commonly used in a variety of different advertising media. Commercials print ads online ads and sponsored programs are all conducive to analysis with eye tracking technology. Analyses may focus on visibility of a target product or logo in the context of a magazine newspaper website virtual world or televised event. This allows researchers to assess in great detail how often a sample of consumers fixates on the target logo product or advertisement. In this way an advertiser can quantify the success of a given campaign in terms of actual visual attention.

Eye tracking also provides package designers with the opportunity to examine the visual behavior of a consumer while interacting with a target package. This may be used to analyze distinctiveness attractiveness and the tendency of the package to be chosen for purchase. Eye tracking is often used while the target product is in the prototype stage. Prototypes are tested against each other and against competitors to examine which specific elements are associated with high visibility and or appeal.

Another application of eye tracking research is in the field of automotive design. Eye tracking cameras may be integrated into automobiles to provide the vehicle with the capacity to assess in real time the visual behavior of the driver. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA estimates that drowsiness is the primary causal factor in 100 000 police reported accidents per year. Another NHTSA study suggests that 80 of collisions occur within three seconds of a distraction. By equipping automobiles with the ability to monitor drowsiness inattention and cognitive engagement driving safety could be dramatically enhanced. Lexus claims to have equipped its LS 460 automobile with the first driver monitor system in 2006 providing a warning if the driver takes his or her eye off the road.

Eye tracking is also used in communication systems for disabled persons allowing the user to speak mail surf the web and so with only the eyes as tool. Eye control works even when the user has involuntary body movement as a result of cerebral palsy or other disability and or when the user wears glasses.

A surrogate marker measurement unit may also measure face pattern for example by measuring user facial features perhaps in relation to a control user face pattern image captured when the user was not interacting with a presented characteristic. Alternatively a subject s face pattern may be compared to an average face pattern compiled from a large number of faces in the population cohort. In one embodiment the reaction of a member of population cohort to an onscreen avatar may be a smile or a frown that may be detectable by a camera monitoring the interaction. Information suggesting that a user smiles in response to viewing a presented characteristic may be transmitted to association unit .

A surrogate marker measurement unit may include a pen including electronic sensing capability that may include the capability to monitor a subject s hand for temperature blood flow tremor fingerprints or other attributes. Reaction time among young males aged 18 28 that play video games with some frequency may be distinguishable from average reaction times of women and or users in older age groups.

In another embodiment a surrogate marker measurement unit and or device may anonymize physiologic activity measurement data acquired during a subject s interaction with one or more presented characteristics. Anonymization of member of population cohort data may be accomplished through various methods known in the art including data coding k anonymization de association pseudonymization or the like.

In one embodiment brain activity measurement unit can measure brain activity during presentation of an appearance characteristic of a member of population cohort different from the member of population cohort that is responding to the characteristic. For example a middle aged member of population cohort may be presented with a characteristic of a child aged member of the population cohort during which physiologic activity measurement unit brain activity measurement unit and or surrogate marker measurement unit can measure a physiological response to the presentation of the characteristic.

Operation depicts measuring at least one physiologic activity of the at least one member of the population cohort the at least one physiologic activity proximate to at least one presented characteristic of a member of a different population cohort.

In one embodiment brain activity measurement unit can measure brain activity during presentation of a speech characteristic of a member of a population cohort that is different from the population cohort to which member of population cohort belongs. For example for a population cohort including males aged 18 24 a member of population cohort i.e. a male aged 18 24 may be presented with a characteristic of a female and thus a member of a different population cohort during which physiologic activity measurement unit brain activity measurement unit and or surrogate marker measurement unit can measure a physiological response to the presentation of the female characteristic.

Operation depicts associating at least one electrical brain activity with the at least one mental state. For example the device association unit emotion association module attention association module and or cognition association module can associate at least one electrical brain activity with at least one mental state. In one embodiment association unit can receive an electrical brain activity measurement such as measurement of electrical activation of the hippocampus in response to presentation of a characteristic to a member of population cohort . The electrical brain activity measurement may be received from for example EEG module . Association unit can then search one or more functional brain mapping databases based on the electrical brain activity measurement to find one or more matching mental states. For example activation of the hippocampus is associated in the literature with enhanced motivational drive for food and drugs. Thus an association may be made between hippocampus activation and enhanced motivational drive for example based on research findings e.g. Wang et al. Gastric stimulation in obese subjects activates the hippocampus and other regions involved in brain reward circuitry PNAS vol. 103 pp. 15641 45 2006 .

In this embodiment an avatar with a specific set of facial features as the at least one characteristic may be presented to a member of population cohort during which presentation MEG module can measure the brain s electrical activity based on indicated magnetic fields. For example presentation of the avatar with the specific set of facial features may elicit electrical activity in the prefrontal and or parietal areas of the brain. Association unit may thus match the activation measurement pattern with a known pattern of brain activation from research indicating which brain areas are activated when attention is required. For example activation of the thalamic reticular nucleus is also associated with selective attention. See Contreras et al.

After measurement of a physiologic activity proximate to the presentation and association of the physiologic activity with a mental state an attribute specification unit non verbal attribute specification unit and or body attribute specification unit can specify the specific hairstyle as the at least one avatar attribute for incorporation into an avatar design. For example if viewing the hairstyle elicited approval in the member of population cohort specification of an approximation of the hairstyle in the design of an avatar may result in an avatar that is attractive to the member of population cohort and or population cohort in general.

Operation depicts specifying the at least one avatar attribute based on a mental state based on a physiologic activity at or above a defined threshold. For example device attribute specification unit voice specification unit and or non verbal attribute specification unit can specify at least one avatar attribute based on a mental state based on a physiologic activity at or above a defined threshold. In one embodiment attribute specification unit can specify an avatar attribute that is based on a presented characteristic that elicits for example activity in the frontopolar cortex above a specified intensity level as measured by for example fMRI or FNIR. Because low level activations of the frontopolar cortex may occur frequently having little or no significance in terms of indicating mental state an association unit may nevertheless make an association based on low level activation of a brain area or surrogate marker a filter may be employed to allow only mental state associations founded on activations above a certain threshold to pass to an attribute specification unit . Such a filter may be employed at the level of the physiologic measurement unit such that measurements that do not meet or exceed the defined threshold level or intensity are not transmitted to the association unit . Alternatively a filter may be employed at the stage of the association unit such that only associations between mental state and physiologic measurements at or above the defined threshold are transmitted to attribute specification unit . In addition or alternatively a filter may be employed at the level of the attribute specification unit such that mental states grounded on physiological measurements below the defined threshold are not specified.

Operation depicts specifying the at least one avatar attribute based on a mental state based on a physiologic activity signature. For example device attribute specification unit voice specification unit and or non verbal attribute specification unit can specify at least one avatar attribute based on a mental state based on a physiologic activity signature. In one embodiment attribute specification unit can specify an avatar attribute that is based on a presented characteristic that elicits for example a specific constellation of brain activity and or surrogate marker s of brain activity as measured by for example fMRI module FNIR module and or by surrogate marker measurement unit . For example presentation of a face characteristic to a member of population cohort may coincide with detection of activation of the visual cortex perhaps indicating visual contact with the characteristic activation of the right prefrontal and parietal areas perhaps indicating visual vigilance i.e. attention activation of the right hemisphere of the bilateral fusiform gyrus perhaps indicating perception of the face characteristic activation of the medial temporal regions perhaps indicating retrieval of an item specific memory and activation of the ventral striatum and decreased activity in the insula perhaps indicating a positive emotional response such as approval increased frequency of eye movements to the face characteristic and iris dilation. An association unit may associate some or all of the above physiological measurements with one or more mental states in effect creating a signature mental state for the reaction of member of population cohort to the face characteristic alternatively association unit may identify a known physiologic activity signature or pattern that corresponds to a known mental state i.e. a known association.

Association unit emotion association module attention association module and or cognition association module may then associate the physiologic measurement with at least one mental state. Attribute specification unit may then specify an avatar attribute based on the mental state for example an approving mental state. In a successive iteration the attribute specification unit may send an avatar including the characteristic previously associated with an approving mental state to presentation unit for presentation perhaps to a different member of population cohort . Alternatively an avatar may be sent including a variant of the characteristic previously associated with an approving mental state to presentation unit for presentation to the same member of population cohort or to a different member of population cohort . Alternatively an avatar may be sent including a different characteristic to presentation unit for presentation to the same member of population cohort or to a different member of population cohort . This process may be repeated in rapid succession to gauge preferences of a member of population cohort and or other members of population cohort for attributes of an avatar and or an avatar as whole.

The computing device includes computer executable instructions that when executed on the computing device cause the computing device to a present at least one characteristic to at least one member of a population cohort b measure at least one physiologic activity of the at least one member of the population cohort the at least one physiologic activity proximate to the at least one presented characteristic c associate the at least one physiological activity with at least one mental state and d specify at least one avatar attribute based on the at least one mental state.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in general the same may be said of sender and or other entity oriented terms as such terms are used herein.

After a start operation operation depicts identifying a member of a population cohort. For example a device population cohort identification module demographic identification module and or selection module may identify a member of a population cohort . In one embodiment population cohort identification module can identify a member of population cohort based on for example video images of the population cohort member . For example demographic module can analyze for example facial features to identify for example a female population cohort member based on face shape and or hairstyle. In another example demographic module can analyze video footage of a shopper at a particular store to identify for example an asian shopper based on eye shape and or skin color. In one embodiment a member of population cohort may be identified by selection module accessed by a user of system . For example a user of system may choose from a menu of available population cohorts stored in selection module a particular population cohort as a way of choosing a member of population cohort . As depicted in device and or population cohort identification module may be in communication with device to access a specified cohort linked avatar attribute that corresponds to a selected population cohort. Alternatively device may include the cohort linked avatar attribute specification functionality of system and or device .

Operation depicts indicating at least one behavior in the member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and at least one cohort linked avatar. For example a device cohort linked avatar presentation module indication module and or device may indicate at least one behavior in the member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and at least one cohort linked avatar. For example device indication module and or cohort linked avatar presentation module can access a specified cohort linked avatar appropriate for the identified population cohort perhaps from device . Device indication module and or cohort linked avatar presentation module can then indicate a future behavior such as an inquiry an internet search a shopping behavior and or a purchasing behavior that is likely to occur upon presentation of the specified cohort linked avatar to a member of population cohort .

Operation depicts identifying a member of a demographic population cohort. For example a device population cohort identification module demographic identification module and or selection module can identify a member of a demographic population cohort. In one embodiment a demographic identification module can identify an age range in a member of population such as over age 52 as the demographic population based on an analysis of cloudiness of the eye associated with cataracts. In the United States age related lenticular changes have been reported in 42 of those between the ages of 52 to 64 60 of those between the ages 65 and 74 and 91 of those between the ages of 75 and 85. Accordingly may include a camera that can analyze an individual s eye for cloudiness to identify a member of population cohort .

In another embodiment demographic module may identify a population member s ethnicity based on detection of a foreign language or accented speech such as a southern accent a Boston accent a Spanish accent a British accent or the like. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 7 263 489 Detection of characteristics of human machine interactions for dialog customization and analysis. 

In another embodiment demographic module may identify a population member as part of a hearing impaired demographic based on body language such as use of American Sign Language for example captured by video footage of the population member.

Operation depicts identifying a member of at least one of an age gender or ethnicity population cohort. For example a device population cohort identification module demographic identification module and or selection module can identify a member of at least one of an age gender or ethnicity population cohort. In one embodiment a demographic identification module can identify a member of an age gender or ethnicity population cohort based on visible an individual s objects such as clothing hairstyle and or adornment such as jewelry which may be particularly informative as an indicators of gender age and or ethnicity. For example a dress may help identify a population member s gender as female and similarly a suit with a necktie may help identify a population member s gender as male.

Further images of the population member s face may be analyzed by demographic module to identify a gender by face shape. See Jain et al. Gender identification using frontal facial images IEEE Multimedia and Expo International Conference 4 pp. 6 8 Jul. 2005 describing gender classification using frontal facial images in which 96 accuracy was reached using a Support Vector Machine SVM in independent component analysis ICA space. Of course other methods of gender identification known in the art may be used. Voice analysis may also be used to identify a particular gender.

A number of methods of identifying ethnicity based on facial features are known in the art for example ethnicity identification may be formulated as a two category classification problem for example to classify the subject as an Asian or non Asian. The input images may be resized to different scales. At each scale a classic appearance based face recognizer based on a linear discriminant analysis representation may be developed under a Bayesian statistical decision framework. An ensemble may then be constructed by integrating classification results to arrive at a final decision. The product rule may be used as an integration strategy. See Lu et al. Ethnicity Identification from Face Images Biometric Technology for Human Identification Eds. Jain et al. Proc. SPIE Vol. 5404 pp. 114 123 2004 .

User ethnicity identification may be based on a number of factors including skin and or hair characteristics associated with ethnicity such as red hair among Caucasians voice and or speech associated with ethnicity such as French accented English indicating French or French Canadian ethnicity face pattern associated with ethnicity such as eye shape nose shape face shape or the like and eye attributes such as blue eyes among Caucasians. In one embodiment Gabor wavelets transformation and retina sampling from user health test function outputs may be combined to extract key facial features and support vector machines may be used for ethnicity classification. An experimental system has used Gabor wavelets transformation and retina sampling in combination to extract key facial features and support vector machines were used for ethnicity classification resulting in approximately 94 success for ethnicity estimation under various lighting conditions. See Hosoi et al. Ethnicity estimation with facial images Sixth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition pp. 195 200 2004 . Of course other methods of ethnicity identification known in the art may be used.

In another embodiment an age gender and or ethnicity characteristic may be based on for example an iris pattern associated with an asian user. For example a bank of multichannel 2D Gabor filters may be used by demographic module to capture global texture information about an a user s iris and AdaBoost a machine learning algorithm may be used to allow a demographic module to learn a discriminant classification principle from a pool of candidate iris feature sets. Iris image data may be thus grouped into race categories for example Asian and non Asian. See Qui et al. Global Texture Analysis of Iris Images for Ethnic Classification Lecture notes in computer science Springer Berlin Heidelberg pp. 411 418 2005 .

The age gender and or ethnicity characteristic also may be based on for example a face pattern analysis indicating facial hair e.g. a beard or moustache signifying to the demographic module that the user is male. The age gender and or ethnicity characteristic also may be based on for example speech or voice data such as Mandarin Chinese accented Chinese or English speech signifying to the demographic module that the population member is of Chinese ethnicity. For example three demographic characteristics may be transmitted in the form of elderly Chinese male. 

Alternatively iris pattern data face pattern data and voice or speech data may each independently relate to one demographic characteristic such as gender. For example iris pattern data may indicate a male user face pattern data detecting facial hair may indicate a male user and voice pitch data may indicate a male user resulting in a male gender demographic population cohort identification with a relatively high level of confidence.

Operation depicts selecting a member of a population cohort. For example a device population cohort identification module demographic identification module and or selection module can select a member of a population cohort. For example selection module may select group of local shoppers as a population cohort. In one embodiment selection module may access from device for example a product avatar such as a BMW automobile that is associated with preference among for example Microsoft employees working in Redmond Wash. Thus the BMW automobile may be a specified cohort linked avatar that is known to be associated with for example a mental state indicating preference among a group of Microsoft employees working in Redmond Wash. Accordingly selection module may select the Microsoft employees working in Redmond Wash. as a population cohort. Alternatively a user of system may select an established demographic group as the population cohort and or an ad hoc population cohort.

Operation depicts indicating a likely behavior of at least one member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. For example device cohort linked avatar presentation module and or indication module can indicate a likely behavior of at least one member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. For example indication module can coordinate with a cohort linked avatar presentation module to evaluate a context of presentation of a cohort linked avatar to a member of population cohort for example during a shopping experience e.g. on a monitor at a shopping mall within a webpage or on a personal electronic device of the member of population cohort . In some embodiments given a context that provides access to marketed items indication module may provide an indication of a likelihood of a shopping and or purchase behavior contingent upon presenting the image of a cohort linked avatar and or cohort linked avatar attribute to the member of population cohort particularly where the mental state associated with the avatar or attribute is a positive one such as preference.

For example indication module may provide a likelihood of an inquiry behavior as an indication of a behavior upon presentation of a cohort linked avatar such as a particular furniture design to a member of a population cohort the cohort linked avatar furniture design associated with approval in members of the population cohort perhaps consisting of homeowners living in a specific zip code. Other behaviors associated with such feelings of approval in the context of the cohort linked avatar furniture design may also be indicated such as increased eye movements toward the cohort linked avatar furniture design increased attention toward the cohort linked avatar furniture design and or active steps to investigate and or purchase the cohort linked avatar furniture design and or items associated with the cohort linked avatar furniture design.

Operation depicts forecasting at least one behavior of at least one member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. For example device cohort linked avatar presentation module and or indication module can forecast at least one behavior of at least one member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. For example indication module can forecast a click through behavior in a member of population cohort upon presentation of a cohort linked avatar in an advertisement to the member of population cohort for example during an interaction with a social networking site. In some embodiments given a context that provides access to items that are easily selected for further action such as items on webpages indication module may provide a forecast of a clicking typing searching shopping and or purchasing behavior contingent upon presenting for example an the image of a cohort linked avatar and or cohort linked avatar attribute to the member of population cohort particularly where the mental state associated with the avatar or attribute is a positive one such as product preference.

Operation depicts predicting at least one behavior of at least one member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. For example device cohort linked avatar presentation module and or indication module can predict at least one behavior of at least one member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. For example indication module can predict a purchasing behavior as a result of cohort linked avatar presentation module presenting an image of a cohort linked avatar to a member of population cohort for example during a shopping experience e.g. in a shop window on a facebook page and or on a personal electronic device of the member of population cohort . For example a cohort linked avatar music attribute may be specified which is associated with approval in a population demographic that is known to buy music at a particular internet outlet. Indication module may predict that selective presentation of the cohort linked avatar music attribute to members of population cohort will result in members of the population cohort listening to the cohort linked music attribute and or other music associated with the cohort linked music attribute during a given visit to the particular internet outlet.

Operation depicts indicating at least one purchasing behavior in the member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. For example device cohort linked avatar presentation module and or indication module can indicate at least one purchasing behavior in the member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. In one embodiment a cohort linked avatar presentation module can present to for example a group of registered Xbox LIVE users a cohort linked avatar in the form of an image of Master Chief from the Halo franchise of computer games which has been associated with an approving mental state among one or more registered Xbox LIVE users. In one embodiment the image of Master Chief may be paired with one or more marketed items such that the approving mental state associated with the cohort linked avatar Master Chief image may be transferred to the paired item. In this way indication module can indicate a likelihood that a member of population cohort may purchase the paired item by virtue of its association with the cohort linked avatar.

Operation depicts indicating at least one internet usage behavior in the member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. For example device cohort linked avatar presentation module and or indication module can indicate at least one internet usage behavior in the member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. In one embodiment a cohort linked avatar presentation module can present to for example a member of population cohort a cohort linked avatar in the form of an audio clip that has been associated with a feeling of reward among one or more members of population cohort . In one embodiment an audio clip may be presented e.g. played during the presentation of a photo and or video image of a marketed item such that the feeling of reward associated with the cohort linked avatar audio clip may be transferred to the paired item image. In this way indication module can indicate that a member of population cohort may research shop for and or purchase the paired item by virtue of its association with the cohort linked avatar. For example cohort linked avatar presentation module can play an audio clip such as a Bart Simpson tag line such as Eat my shorts during the presentation of an image on a website such as a hyperlinked image of a marketed toy to a member of population cohort . Accordingly indication module can predict that the member of population cohort will associate a feeling of reward with the audio clip and the image of a toy and will click on the hyperlinked image of the toy to learn more about it and or to purchase it.

Operation depicts indicating at least one shopping behavior in the member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar.

For example device cohort linked avatar presentation module and or indication module can indicate at least one behavior in at least one of an online shopper an online gamer a virtual world participant or a social networking site participant based on an association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. In one embodiment a cohort linked avatar musical group that is associated with approval and or preference in a population cohort consisting of Austin Tex. residents aged may be presented to a member of the population cohort at an event in a virtual world that involves marketing of a local Austin Tex. business. Accordingly indication module may indicate a likelihood that members of the population cohort in the virtual world will for example take steps to learn more about the local Austin Tex. business subsequent to presentation of the cohort linked avatar musical group together with the local Austin Tex. business because of feelings of approval and or preference associated with the presented cohort linked avatar musical group.

Operation depicts indicating at least one behavior in a member of a demographic population based on an association between the demographic population and at least one avatar linked to the demographic population. For example device cohort linked avatar presentation module and or indication module can indicate at least one behavior in a member of a demographic population based on an association between the demographic population and at least one avatar linked to the demographic population. In one embodiment a cohort linked avatar audio clip of George Clooney s voice associated with approval and or preference in a population cohort consisting of women aged as a demographic population may be presented to a member of the population cohort as part of an advertisement for a men s cologne for example. Accordingly indication module may predict that a woman aged to whom the cohort linked avatar audio clip of George Clooney s voice with the advertisement is presented may for example shop for the cologne as a result of feelings of approval and or preference associated with the presented cohort linked avatar audio clip of George Clooney s voice.

Identification of a demographic population may be based on a fact based attribute of a population cohort. For example a population cohort such as individuals wearing a dress at the time of product purchase may result in classification of that population cohort as belonging to a female gender demographic. Such a classification while not perfect may provide a likelihood of gender that may be confirmed by other means such as detection of face shape by an imaging device detection of voice pitch and or speech pattern name association with gender e.g. Mary and Jane as female names or the like. Of course information about the demographics of a population cohort member may be provided directly by the member of population cohort perhaps as part of a permissions process or perhaps indirectly by a witness to the presentation of a cohort linked avatar attribute to a population cohort member.

Operation depicts indicating at least one behavior in the member of the population cohort based on a statistical association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. For example device cohort linked avatar presentation module and or indication module can indicate at least one behavior in the member of the population cohort based on a statistical association between the population cohort and the at least one cohort linked avatar. In one embodiment cohort linked avatar presentation module may select for presentation to members of population cohort one of a set of cohort linked avatars each of which are associated with approval in a population cohort consisting of male NASCAR race attendees aged for example. Such a set of cohort linked avatars for example a group of beef jerky brands may be evaluated by device for the most statistically valid one of the group to be presented by cohort linked avatar presentation module . For example device cohort linked avatar presentation module and or indication module may rank the cohort linked avatar beef jerky brands by the number of population cohort members measured to establish the association between measured physiologic activity and approval by degree of physiologic activity associated with presentation of the beef jerky brand in the measured population cohort members by geographical location of the measurements or the like. Accordingly indication module may identify one cohort linked avatar beef jerky brand such as Jeff Foxworthy s beef jerky as the one that is most likely to be purchased if cohort linked avatar presentation module presents a cohort linked avatar Jeff Foxworthy s beef jerky to males aged at a particular NASCAR event based on higher approval associated with the cohort linked avatar Jeff Foxworthy s beef jerky compared to that of other cohort linked avatar beef jerky brands.

Operation depicts indicating at least one behavior in the member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and at least one avatar linked to the member of the population cohort. For example device cohort linked avatar presentation module and or indication module can indicate at least one behavior in the member of the population cohort based on an association between the population cohort and at least one avatar linked to the member of the population cohort. In one embodiment cohort linked avatar presentation module may present to a member of population cohort a cohort linked avatar that was specified based on one or more physiologic measurements of the member of population cohort . For example an individual s behavior may be predicted based on a reaction to a custom specified cohort linked avatar that is specific to the individual as a member of population cohort .

For example device and or device may present an instance of media content such as an image of a personal electronic device like an iphone or a Zune media player to an individual as a member of population cohort . Device and or device may then measure at least one physiologic activity at a time proximate to presentation of the Zune for example. Following association of the measured physiologic activity such as brain activity measured by FNIR module with a mental state such as preference attribute specification unit may specify an attribute of the Zune and or the image of the Zune for example as a cohort linked avatar associated with preference in the member of population cohort . Accordingly presentation of the cohort linked avatar Zune image to the same member of population cohort in other contexts may provide a basis for indication module to predicts a behavior in the member of population cohort . For example cohort linked avatar presentation module may present to the member of population cohort the cohort linked avatar Zune image together with a particular audio clip of a new band such that indication module can predict that the member of population cohort will listen to the audio clip or a sample of the audio clip and or purchase a song and or collection of songs by the new band.
