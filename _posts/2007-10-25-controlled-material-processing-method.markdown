The invention relates to a material processing control system and method in particular for controlling a viscous material processing system.

In a viscous material processing system feed is mixed and additives are injected in precise proportions to produce a customized product. The system requires exact and reliable dosing and feed operations to achieve uniform products with narrow tolerance properties. Accurately metering the material in a feed step can be critical to proper system operation.

However it is difficult to accurately process a viscous material. The material only slowly responds to change in feed rate. The material may be resistant to pouring or if it can be poured pour rate can be extremely slow. The material may exhibit high levels of adhesion or tendency to stick to other materials and or cohesion or a tendency to remain stuck to itself and therefore resistant to separation. The material may be shear thickening exhibiting increasing viscosity as shear on the material is increased. These properties present problems to process control.

Accurate quantities of the material are difficult to separate from a bulk of the material and are difficult to accurately process. Accordingly there is a need to control processing of such material. Also there is a need to accurately cut defined quantities of such material from a bulk quantity regardless of the form of the bulk quantity and there is a need to accurately charge a viscous material to a processing system.

The invention can be described as a viscous material processing system comprising a feed system controller having a set of instructions to store an input set point weight or amount sense a progressing weight or amount of material fed by the feed system compare the progressing weight with the set point weight or amount and terminate feed from the system when the compared progressing weight is substantially equal to the set point weight or amount and a viscous material compounding system connected to the feed system to receive material fed by the feed system.

The invention relates to the handling of a viscous material such as a silicone gum. Silicone gum includes a viscous silicone or polysiloxane or organopolysiloxane that has the chemical formula RSiO where R organic groups such as methyl ethyl and phenyl. These materials typically comprise an inorganic silicon oxygen backbone . . . Si O Si O Si O . . . with attached organic side groups which can be four coordinate. In some cases organic side groups can be used to link two or more of these Si O backbones together.

By varying the Si O chain lengths side groups and crosslinking silicones can be synthesized with a wide variety of properties and compositions. They can vary in consistency from liquid to gel to rubber to hard plastic. Silicone rubber or silicone gum is a silicone elastomer typically having high temperature properties. Silicone rubber offers resistance to extreme temperatures being able to operate normally from minus 100 C. to plus 500 C. In such conditions tensile strength elongation tear strength and compression set can be superior to conventional rubbers.

A silicone gum can be extruded or molded into custom shapes and designs such as tubes strips solid cord or custom profiles within size restrictions specified by a manufacturer. Cord can be joined to make O Rings and extruded profiles can also be joined to make up seals.

It is desirable to provide a viscous feed system that accurately and efficiently processes viscous materials such as silicone gum for use in various applications. However these materials can be highly resistant to flow highly adhering highly cohering and or shear thickening and consequently difficult to handle. Accuracy of a packaging process and or accuracy of a process of obtaining a defined quantity of such material for example in a continuous process is costly when substantial time is required for cutting or separating a quantity of the material from a larger quantity. Also it is costly and disadvantageous when an incorrect amount of material is used in a downstream process.

The invention provides a system and method to control processing of viscous material. Features of the invention will become apparent from the drawings and following detailed discussion which by way of example without limitation describe preferred embodiments of the invention. In this application a reference to back means left on a drawing or drawings and a reference to forward means right on the drawing or drawings.

A preferred embodiment shown in the drawings illustrates the invention as a process to compound silicone gum into a base for forming articles. In the drawings is a schematic top view representation and is a schematic side view representation of a section of a material processing system showing an integrated feed system and compounding system . The feed system includes a battery of material extracting apparatus MEA conveyor and chute . and are elevation views of an MEA and is a cut away side sectional view of a section of the MEA . The MEA includes container evacuator feed tube cutting apparatus and floor scale . The integrated feed system is controllably connected to controller . is a cut away view of an upper section of the drum press MEA of and . As shown in and compounding system includes mixer roll mill conveyor belt and compounder .

The MEA serves to express the viscous material from a container to the compounding system . In typical operations 55 gallon steel drums from a pallet are dumped into totes and the totes approx. 80 pounds each are dumped into a Banbury mixer. In a preferred compounding operation of the invention with respect to and operation commences with delivery of a pallet of four drums of gum. While the drum can be any material holding enclosure the drawings embodiment is a feed system including a method of evacuating a silicone gum containing drum . A suitable drum in the embodiment has full openable ends and has a cylindrical wall of steel fiberboard or other material structure for transporting a silicone gum material. The drum has opposite ends each of which is openable to accommodate a movable plunger at one end as hereinafter described.

The material in the drums may be identical or it may be of a variety of physical properties such as viscosity. The drums are removed from the pallet one by one by drum hauler such as from Easy Lift Equipment Co. Inc. 2 Mill Park Court Newark Del. 19713. The lid of each of three drums is removed and each of the drums is loaded by the hauler into a respective container evacuator which may be a Schwerdtel S 6 F drum press. Use of the drum hauler eliminates ergonomic risks associated with lifting and handling the heavy drums . The silicone gum is then forced from each drum by an MEA into the conveyor . In the drawings embodiment an MEA comprises a container evacuator feed tube and cutting apparatus . The container evacuator can be a drum press which is a device that evacuates viscous or compacted contents from a drum.

As illustrated in and the container evacuator is a press that comprises a substantially cylindrical chamber with hinged enclosures and for securing a drum removably within the chamber . The chamber and hinged enclosures and securely cradle the drum during a material extracting operation. A disc shaped platen fits into the chamber with a flat driving surface oriented perpendiculars to the longitudinal axis of the chamber and correspondingly perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of a drum held within the chamber .

The operation of feed system can be described with reference to and . In operation the press enclosures and are unlatched by activating fasteners to open enclosures and . The drum hauler is used to load a first drum into the press cavity . The drum is positioned by a locator ring at the base of the chamber . The press enclosures and resist axial expansion pressure exerted by plunger driving through drum . The enclosures and are secured by a plurality of fasteners .

Each MEA includes the container evacuator feed tube and cutting apparatus and cage and each is set on a respective floor scale . In each MEA the feed tube is connected through the disc shaped platen to communicate with the press cavity . The platen is driven by hydraulic plunger .

An operator can commence system operation at controller . When a cycle is activated by the operator a plunger of each container evacuator of the battery shown in is activated via control lines . shows connecting sections of control lines to MEA . Then as the screw conveyor starts turning the press platen with connected feed tube is forced by hydraulically driven plunger to travel down into the drum interior. As further illustrated in as platen traverses the drum longitudinal axis within the press cavity drum contents are displaced upward into a connecting orifice of the feed tube . As the platen completes traversing the drum axis all material is forced upward into the feed tube to be eventually expelled from the feed tube discharge port .

The material is cut into increments by cutting apparatus as it exits from the discharge port to the conveyor to charge to compounding system . Cutting can be accomplished by various cutting mechanisms including a cutting head disposed at an outlet end port of the feed tube . In the and embodiment the MEA includes a cutting apparatus located at discharge port . The cutting apparatus includes rails that secure cutting wire to guide the wire to cut material exiting the feed tube discharge port . The rails secure the cutting wire to traverse the feed tube longitudinal axis at discharge port when activated by controller via lines .

The controller of illustrates an embodiment of the invention. Controller is responsively connected to loss of weight scales via lines to sense loss of weight as material is expressed from the drums to conveyor . The controller computes a weight of material charged to the conveyor by the difference between an initial weight of the MEA and initially emplaced and full drum . In the embodiment of the drawings the controller can sense an initial total weight of all the MEAs and emplaced full drums of the MEA battery of for example the three shown in . The controller monitors the combined weight as material in the drums is evacuated to the conveyor . The controller contemporaneously calculates a weight of material charged to the conveyor and hence to the compounding system according to a difference between the initial total weight and contemporaneously sensed total weight.

The controller also can control operation of cutting apparatus according to the calculated charged material weight. Initially the cutting apparatus can be programmed to make cuts of about football sized material for example to fit into a 14 inner diameter screw conveyor . Once a piece of material is cut from the feed tube discharge port floor scale senses a contemporaneous weight and feeds this signal back to the controller . The controller controls the material processing system according to set points. In this application a set point weight or amount is a target quantity or amount of material to be fed from a feed system usually in a feed session. In one embodiment set point weight or amount means a point weight or amount at which the feed session is to be terminated. In another embodiment as the controller senses a contemporaneous weight signal and calculates that a total charged weight is within a specified range of total material to be charged for example within 15 pounds of set point weight or amount to the compounding system the controller can signal the cutting apparatus via lines to increase cut frequently to produce smaller incremental pieces. The smaller pieces at approach to set point weight or amount permit improved control of feed to attain a charged material weight within a prescribed tolerance range for example 2 pounds for a batch.

As the drum evacuation process is completed door fasteners of the hinged enclosures and open and a controller Run Screen can display NEW DRUM. A beacon light mounted on the container evacuator can turn yellow indicating another drum is ready to be changed. The hydraulic platen driving motor terminates and the chamber enclosures open. The evacuator is reloaded with a drum and the process repeated. As material is charged from the MEAs to the screw conveyor the conveyor is turning at low rpms to feed the material to the mixer. The screw is programmed to stop turning 90 seconds after the last MEA makes its last cut. This time can be adequate to clear all material from the conveyor .

Conveyor transports and drops the cut viscous material to chute to compounding system which includes mixer such as a Banbury roll mill conveyor belt and compounder . In the mixer fumed silica the silicone gum and a treating agent can be added to form a densified polymer filler mass. After the gum feed is mixed it is dropped into the nip of roll mill where the material is rolled into a strip form. After a drop a programmed logic controller PLC for example controller verifies that the mixer drop door has opened then reclosed and is ready for feed. For any residual material that hangs in the chute a pusher is programmed to sweep a few seconds after the conveyor stops. This serves to scrape down the chute and ensure all material gets into the mixer to correctly formulate the batch.

The mill imparts a final mix to fully incorporate filler and to cool material. Then the material is stripped from the mill in a strip form. The strip form is fed by means of conveyor belt into compounder which may be an extruder. The compounder serves to clean and form the material for packaging. The material can be packaged and boxed through an automated cut weigh and packaging system.

The controller of can be a microprocessor computer data processing device semiconductor chip or the like. is a flow diagram of a preferred embodiment control system of the invention. The signal processing can be incorporated by controller to control a material processing system as follows.

At a session start input values and that are set point weights or amounts are input into the control system . Input value represents a first target value of material that triggers a change in a charging rate of material to the compounding system . Input value represents a target total material to be charged in a session to a compounding system for example to the compounding system via conveyor of . A session is a period defined by a time or quantity of material to be charged to the processing system . The time or quantity may be determined by an amount of a contract package size shipment size or the like of material to be charged for further processing or use and the input values and can be identified by a look up table resident within a controller or entered by an operator according to desired target values. According to an aspect of the present invention charging smaller increments from a continuous viscous feed material toward the end of a session at permits charging of a precise total material for the session. With smaller increments a session can be terminated within a small plus or minus material of the session target total quantity or amount .

Controller has a set of instructions to store the input values and representing the material set points for material to be charged from the MEA battery . A start signal activates the MEA battery comprising for example 2 3 or n number of material extracting apparatus . Each of a battery of sensors S S. . . S senses a respective weight of each MEA of the battery including evacuator container and contents. First an initial weight is sensed of the evacuator and a full container prior to expressing any content. This initial value is input to controller and summed and stored for all MEAs of the battery . Then as the viscous material process proceeds each evacuator plunger of each MEA of battery drives axially into each container to express material from the container . As material is expressed and cut to conveyor each sensor S S. . . Ssenses a progressing combined weight of each material extracting apparatus container and dwindling contained material and the combined weights are summed to a sum weight . The sum weight is subtracted from to provide a progressing amount of material that represents material charged to the compounding system by time or period n.

Then progressing amount is compared with input values for target total material and amount of material that represents a first value that triggers the charging rate change. If the comparison indicates that 

The following Example is illustrative and should not be construed as a limitation on the scope of the claims.

This EXAMPLE is a combined description of press MEA experiments at Schwerdtel US headquarters New Jersey ProSys Corporation Missouri and at GE Silicones Waterford N.Y. Experiments on a shaftless screw conveyor were conducted at GE Silicones Waterford using Martin Sprocket equipment.

A viscous material feed system as schematically illustrated in the drawings included a Schwerdtel S 6 F drum press mounted to Vishay BLH floor scale that measured material flow according to loss of weight. The Schwerdtel S 6 F press included a hydraulic pressure driven cylinder and platen that drives a platen into a 55 gallon drum.

The feed system included a feed tube to receive material expressed from a drum by the press and a pneumatic solenoid operated cutting system that metered material from the feed tube to a 12 24 shaftless screw conveyor according to loss of weight sensed by the scale. The screw conveyor interfaced to a chute. The chute permitted material to fall via gravity directly to a Banbury mixer. Material remaining in the chute was cleared by a pneumatic pusher prior to each mix GE design and fabrication . The system was controlled by operators at two 2 QuickPanel LM90 touch screens of a control system.

In operation an operator first entered set point weight or amounts into a system controller. In this embodiment one set point weight or amount represented a target batch of silicone gum to be charged to a Banbury mixer which was part of a silicone gum compounding system. A pallet of four 4 fifty five 55 gallon drums of silicone polymer Viscosity Range 150 000 to 900 000 Poise was placed on a drum carousel. The 55 gallon straight sided steel drums were delivered by the carousel and one drum was loaded into the Schwerdtel S 6 F drum press using an Easy Lift Equipment Drum Hauler unit. The Schwerdtel S 6 F drum press was controlled by a GE Fanuc 90 30 PLC. Material was displaced from the drum to the feed tube by the hydraulic Schwerdtel gum press.

The operator pressed a START OR RESTRT BATCH button of the controller to commence operation. The press doors were secured by hydraulically driven fasteners. Then as the screw conveyor started turning the hydraulically driven press platen commenced traveling down into the drum. As a platen traversed the drum drum contents were squeezed upward into the feed tube. As the platen completed traversing the drum axis all material was forced upward into the feed tube. As material exited the feed tube a pneumatic solenoid operated cutting system diced the material into pieces that then felt into a 12 24 shaftless screw conveyor to charge to a Banbury mixer.

A batch of material flow from conveyor to the Banbury mixer was measured by loss of weight detected by the Vishay BLH load cells. A combined weight of presses feed tubes cutting mechanisms and material containing drums was registered by the control system as a first weight. The control system monitored a charged weight of silicone gum to the Banbury by registering progressing weight as silicone gum was pressed from the drums and expelled through the feed tubes and cutting systems. The control system displayed a differential between the first weight and registered progressive weights that represented a charged silicone gum weight. The cutting mechanism rate was increased when charged silicone gum weight was within 15 pounds of the set point weight. The control system continued to sense the differential weight and terminated the batch operation when the differential weight registered within a 2 pound range of the set point weight or amount.
