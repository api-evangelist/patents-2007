This application is related to commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 951 018 filed on even date herewith and entitled RECONFIGURABLE ANTENNA STEERING PATTERNS the 018 Application . The 018 Application is incorporated herein by reference.

The use of modeling in the design of antennas is known. Typically antenna designers use classic Euclidean geometry for example simple squares circles and triangles to design the shape of an antenna and its components also known as antenna elements to obtain certain antenna characteristics. For example the antenna designer will use a combination of shapes to control the antenna signal beam shape also known as the antenna pattern or radiation pattern. This use of combinations of antenna elements and shapes to obtain desired antenna characteristics is typically referred to as antenna beam steering or beam shaping. Geometric antennas usually have well defined fixed characteristics.

Reconfigurable antennas represent a class of antenna that normally does not have a specific characteristic. Instead this class of antennas require configuration before they are usable. Reconfigurable antennas can operate over large frequency ranges and can be beam steered without the use of multiple radiating elements and phase shifters as are found in a phased array type of antenna. In addition this class of antenna does not generate grating lobes like a phased array antenna because the radiation source is a continuous element instead of a multiplicity of individual elements.

Reconfigurable antennas can accommodate a wide variety of specifications such as beam width operating frequency and radiation angle. The difficulty with an antenna of this type is to determine a configuration that offers the desired performance based on a particular set of requirements and ensure that the configuration of the antenna is the desired configuration. At present configurable antennas do not verify the configuration.

The following specification discloses reconfigurable antenna pattern verification for reconfigurable antenna arrays. This summary is made by way of example and not by way of limitation. It is merely provided to aid the reader in understanding some aspects of at least one embodiment described in the following specification.

Particularly in one embodiment a method of verifying programmable antenna configurations is provided. The method comprises selecting a desired antenna configuration from a plurality of antenna configuration patterns with the selected antenna configuration forming at least one reconfigurable antenna from reconfigurable antenna array elements. The method validates the formation of the selected antenna configuration to determine antenna performance of the at least one reconfigurable antenna.

The various described features are drawn to emphasize features relevant to the embodiments disclosed. Like reference characters denote like elements throughout the figures and text of the specification.

Embodiments disclosed herein relate to reconfigurable antenna elements and antenna configuration patterns that comprise at least one method of antenna signal output verification. In at least one embodiment an electronic system for antenna configuration pattern verification provides antenna steering and pattern generation modules operable to configure individual antenna elements to form the antenna configuration patterns discussed here. For example the system directs a programmable controller unit to send commands to an array of switches to configure a particular antenna beam pattern. Moreover the beam pattern configuration forms at least one reconfigurable antenna having a known radiation beam pattern. Accordingly at least one steering pattern can be developed for each reconfigurable antenna due to differences in radio frequency RF propagation characteristics of each of the antenna configuration patterns.

For example the antenna steering module for the antenna configuration pattern verification system discussed above configures the individual antenna array elements to form each of the antenna configuration patterns. The antenna steering module issues commands to the antenna array switches to form the steerable antenna with a known radiation beam shape at a particular frequency. In one implementation the antenna steering module selects a configuration of switches that steers the antenna configuration patterns formed in the reconfigurable antenna array to resonate in a desired direction and frequency.

In at least one embodiment the antenna steering module further comprises an antenna steering verification module operable to test and verify the combination of switch positions. The antenna steering verification module verifies that the reconfigurable antenna array produces the correct antenna configuration pattern before the antenna is used. In one implementation a comparison can be made between the desired or programmed configuration against the actual sensed configuration to determine that the antenna is steered as desired and ready to use.

In operation the antenna configuration controller monitors and validates operation of the programmable elements of each of the reconfigurable antenna arrays based on a desired radiation pattern to determine antenna performance. In the example embodiment of the antenna configuration controller receives one or more antenna configuration input commands as shown in . In one implementation the desired radiation pattern is based on an antenna signal beam output requested by the one or more programmable antenna configuration inputs.

In one embodiment the antenna configuration controller instructs the system to form at least one antenna configuration pattern using at least one of the reconfigurable antenna arrays . The antenna configuration controller loads the at least one antenna configuration pattern configured to provide a prescribed signal beam strength for the antenna signal beam output at a desired frequency. For example the antenna pattern generation module provides a plurality of previously identified programmable antenna configuration patterns based on the at least one antenna configuration pattern requested by the antenna configuration controller . In the same example the antenna steering module loads the at least one antenna configuration pattern on at least one of the reconfigurable antenna arrays .

In the example embodiment of the antenna steering verification module verifies the at least one antenna configuration pattern formed by the reconfigurable antenna array . In one implementation the antenna steering verification module detects a configuration state of configured pad elements of the reconfigurable antenna array where the configuration state is indicative of an energy threshold level for the configured pad elements. The antenna steering verification module compares the energy levels at a plurality of switches adjacent to the configured pad elements of the reconfigurable antenna array to verify that the monitored antenna configuration pattern is substantially functional as the at least one antenna configuration pattern as further discussed below with respect to .

In operation one of the pad elements for example a center element is driven by an electrical signal. By opening and closing one or more of the switches the pattern in which current flows from the center element through the pad elements of the reconfigurable antenna array is configured. In one implementation the pattern of current flow is configured to create the steerable antenna configuration patterns such as but not limited to a bent wire pattern and a spiral pattern each with known radiation patterns. As illustrated in the switches are optically driven switches. In the example embodiment of the optically driven switches avoid the need for additional control wires located near the pad elements which would tend to distort the radiation pattern of the aperture .

In operation for each switch which should be in an ON state based on the antenna array pattern communicated from the antenna configuration controller the drivers will cycle the associated light sources on for time t and off for time t as directed by the duty cycle controller . This is done in order to reduce the power consumption of the switch drivers without impacting switch performance. In one embodiment the duty cycle controller outputs a duty cycle signal comprising a square wave signal with a signal low for time tand a signal high for time t. By duty cycling the light signals from light sources based on tand t a source voltage value V within each of the switches that need to remain off in order to establish the desired antenna array pattern will be maintained above a minimum average light level required to activate each of the switches .

In the example embodiment of the antenna configuration controller is further operable to compare energy levels provided by the drivers at each of the switches configured to be in the ON state based on the antenna array pattern selected in the antenna configuration controller . For example the antenna configuration controller monitors the antenna array pattern programmed by the antenna steering module to determine that the antenna array pattern as configured is substantially functional as the selected antenna array pattern.

The method monitors each of the selected antenna configurations by detecting a configuration state of the antenna array elements block . In one implementation the configuration state is indicative of an energy threshold level for configured array elements. The method further compares the detected energy threshold levels at a plurality of switches adjacent to the configured array elements to determine that the programmable antenna configuration is substantially functional as the at least one reconfigurable antenna block . To further validate the configured array elements the method evaluates each of the monitored antenna configurations based on the configuration of the switches selected to steer the reconfigurable antenna array elements in a desired signal beam direction block . In one embodiment the configuration is valid once the desired antenna performance is achieved block .
