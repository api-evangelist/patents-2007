The invention described hereunder was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96 517 35 U.S.C. 202 in which the Contractor has elected not to retain title.

The present invention generally relates to the field of drilling and more particularly relates to apparatus for penetrating sampling probing and testing of a medium.

Effective probing drilling and coring apparatus find use in a great number of areas such as for example planetary exploration military medical operations construction police investigations geology archaeology sports for example hiking and rock climbing and other games.

Existing drilling techniques are limited by the need for high axial forces large power consumption as well as a need to operate from a heavy platform to drill in non horizontal and or hard surfaces. The life of coring bits is markedly reduced by the breakdown of the binder that holds abrasive material on a bit surface.

Accordingly the capability of existing rotary corers has limited application in power and mass constrained environments. As an example a typical rotary corer that produces 10 mm cores in hard rocks requires at least 20 to 30 watts of power. Such drilling rigs cannot be duty cycled continuously without a loss of efficiency. In addition drill motors can demand as much as three to four times surge current upon startup then during continuous operation.

Conventional rotary corers that for example produce 10 mm diameter cores which may require about 100 N to 150 N or more of axial preload and during core initiation drill walk can induce torques on the drilling platform that may exceed 30 Nm and tangential forces of 100 N. The drill chatter delivers a low frequency for example 2 10 Hz high force perturbations on a drilling platform which requires conventional coring applications to utilize very stable and massive platforms.

In hard rock formations conventional rotary drillers and corers lose an advantage that they sometimes demonstrate in soft materials. In hard rocks conventional drillers stop drilling by shearing and spoliation and become grinders. The grinding process is accompanied by at least a 300 increase in consumed energy per unit length of the core. In addition because the grinding mechanism is determined by the compression failure of the rock the teeth of the corers must be re sharpened frequently. Accordingly sharpness of the bits must be monitored otherwise the heat generation at the tip may increase by a factor of up to 10 times. This increase is accompanied by a concomitant drop in drilling efficiency and often causes burning or melting of the drill bit.

Non traditional drilling technologies such as for example lasers electron beams microwaves hydraulic jets are typically competitive only in applications that are not power limited. Down the well energy required to remove a unit volume of rock for so called modern technologies is about the same as grinding and melting that is three to five times higher than for shear drilling. Unfortunately for modern technologies the ratio of down the well power delivered versus input power generation is below several percent versus 10 to 30 percent for conventional drills. Accordingly many space or power limited applications simply do not have enough power to employ a non traditional drilling technique.

Hammering drills and particularly the Ultrasonic Sonic Driller Corer USDC as shown in various embodiments in various earlier filed U.S. patents and applications offer a solution capable of coring into a variety of rocks and soils using low power and low axial load. The USDC is based on an ultrasonic sonic actuator mechanism. The advantages of this are attractive for potential future robotic missions to explore the planets and moons.

Experiments have shown that the penetration rate of the USDC can be improved by a factor of ten by rotating the drill bit. This supplements the hammering action and provides for faster drilling rates and greater penetration depth. However the increased speed of drilling results in more cuttings and requires removal of the cuttings.

It would be greatly advantageous to provide hammer drilling with rotation of the bit where the bit is independently rotated by a motor to remove large volumes of powdered cuttings and to provide a backup drilling action in case of failure of either rotary or hammering mechanism. It would also be advantageous to provide a bit design with flutes on the surface to remove the powdered cuttings.

It is a primary object of this invention to provide a hammering drill with increased penetration efficiency and increased efficiency of powdered cuttings removal.

It is another object to provide hammering drills combined with rotation of the bit for increased penetration and cuttings removal efficiency.

It is another object to provide a hammering drill in which the bit is independently rotated by a motor to both produce and remove a large volume of cuttings.

It is still another object to provide hammering drills that are light weight and consume low amounts of power energy.

In accordance with the foregoing objects the present invention is an ultrasonic sonic actuator based hammering drill having a two section drill bit including a fluted shaft leading to a distal crown cutter with teeth. The ultrasonic sonic actuator comprises a piezoelectric stack connected to an ultrasonic transducer horn wherein the piezoelectric stack is maintained in compression between a backing and the horn by a prestress bolt to form the ultrasonic sonic actuator. Further the ultrasonic sonic actuator is in contact with a free mass and the drill bit. The piezoelectric stack creates vibrations that are amplified by the horn. As the horn strikes the free mass momentum is carried into the bit creating sonic pulses. These pulses cause a percussion effect between the bit and the rock and the rock fractures when its ultimate strain is exceeded. The bit penetrates sampled media by repeated hammering action. In addition in the preferred embodiment the bit is rotated. To achieve this a keyed shaft is inserted through the ultrasonic actuator. The shaft is connected on one side to a motor and on the opposing side to the drill bit and thereby transmits the rotation from the motor to the drill bit. The drill bit comprises a section for accommodating the ultrasonic horn tip and the free mass a means of coupling with the shaft an outside fluted section and a cutting crown section at the distal end. The crown cutter is defined by a series of cutting teeth and a set of channels on its external surface that corresponds to the flutes on the shaft and this pattern increases the speed of cuttings removal and hence the drilling speed and depth of penetration . As it rotates the fluted bit provides a removal path for the powdered cuttings to travel helically upward along the side of the bit to the surface. The combined hammering with slow speed rotation rapidly produces powdered cuttings. Moreover the decoupled rotation mechanism works independently of the sonic action and provides redundancy in case of a failure of one drilling mechanism. The crown cutter provides a replaceable element for low cost operation.

The present invention is a hammering drill based on an ultrasonic sonic actuator that employs a unique drill bit and independent hammering actuator with rotary actuator for operation of the bit by a combination of hammering with rotation for increased penetration and cuttings removal efficiency.

The hammering ultrasonic sonic actuator section further comprises a set of preload weights mounted atop an ultrasonic sonic actuator the actuator being connected via an ultrasonic transducer horn to a free mass . The free mass is sonically coupled to the drill bit .

The rotary section further comprises a motor mounted stationery on a bracket or the like the motor being coupled through a drive shaft that traverses the ultrasonic sonic section and is keyed into the drill bit .

Thus both the rotary section and hammering ultrasonic sonic actuator section drive the drill bit one with rotary motion and one sonic vibration and the two drives are completely independent.

The actuator and horn may be coupled to one another in any conventional manner. For example as shown in FIG. 3 of the cited U.S. Pat. No. 6 863 136 patent the crown cutter and drill stem communicates with the horn via an extension that enters the horn base and bears against a stop. A free mass is disposed between the horn and the drill stem leaving a gap between the free mass and the horn tip and or free mass and drill stem base for oscillating therebetween in response to actuator vibrations. This free mass oscillation is described in co pending U.S. Pat. No. 6 863 136 to Bar Cohen et al. issued Mar. 8 2005. The free mass may be made of Maraging 300 steel or the like.

In operation the horn amplifies the ultrasonic vibrations that are induced by the piezoelectric stack and impacts the free mass that oscillates between the horn and the drill stem . The free mass allows the drill bit to operate under a combination of the ultrasonic drive frequency 5 kHz and up and a 10 5000 Hz sonic hammering. It is currently capable of high speed drilling e.g. from 2 to 20 mm deep per watt hour for a 6 mm diameter hole in volcanic materials Basalt and Bishop Tuff respectively using low axial preload 

Unfortunately as explained previously the initial penetration rate will begin to degrade with increasing depth. In accordance with the present invention a separate mechanism is provided for rotating the bit thereby allowing for faster drilling rates and greater penetration depth. Moreover a particular fluted configuration of the bit surface facilitates transport of debris out of the hole.

The rotary section further comprises a motor mounted stationery on a mounted bracket or the like the motor rotor being coupled through a drive shaft that traverses the entire hammering ultrasonic sonic actuator section and is keyed to the drill bit .

The drive shaft protrudes downward from the flexible coupling element and traverses the entire hammering drill based ultrasonic sonic actuator section and is keyed into the drill bit .

The distal crown cutter is a substantially annular member that forms a cap over the end of the drill stem . The annular crown cutter has a cylindrical outer surface leading to a flat frontal array of circularly oriented teeth . The teeth in its front surface help fracture the hammered surface. Thus the edges of the teeth protrude outward from the center along an axial pattern.

The drill stem is formed with helical flutes running downward lengthwise substantially the entire length to the crown cutter . The flute has a helical configuration that spirals in a clockwise direction about longitudinal axis. The particular fluted configuration of the drill stem outer surface facilitates transport of debris out of the hole.

The distal crown cutter fits over the end of the drill stem and is fixedly attached thereto. The cylindrical sides of the distal crown cutter are likewise defined by a helical flute running downward lengthwise and adjoining the flute on the stem . The flute likewise has a helical configuration that spirals in a clockwise direction about longitudinal axis.

In operation the crown cutter flute on its external surface corresponds to the flute on the drill stem shaft and merges with it this pattern increasing the speed of cuttings removal and hence the drilling speed and depth of penetration . The extension of the flute on the drill stem onto the cutting crown helps in this regard. One skilled in the art will readily understand that the shape and size of the fluted channel s on the crown can affect the cutting removal speed and can be optimized during design of the crown itself.

If the stack is driven at the resonance frequency of 19.1 kHz with a duty cycle of 20 and a preload of 5 lbs the drill is capable of reaching a depth of approximately 8.5 cm in a total continuous drilling time of 5 minutes. As it rotates the fluted bit provides a removal path for the powdered cuttings to travel helically upward along the side of the stem to the surface. The combined hammering with slow speed rotation rapidly produces powdered cuttings. Moreover the decoupled rotation mechanism works independently of the sonic action and provides redundancy in case of a failure of one drilling mechanism. The crown cutter provides a replaceable element for low cost operation.

Having now fully set forth the preferred embodiment and certain modifications of the concept underlying the present invention various other embodiments as well as certain variations and modifications of the embodiments herein shown and described will obviously occur to those skilled in the art upon becoming familiar with said underlying concept. It is to be understood therefore that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically set forth in the appended claims.
