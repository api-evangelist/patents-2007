This is a continuation application claiming priority to U.S. Ser. No. 11 219 121 filed Sep. 2 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 528 236 which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Ser. No. 60 607 377 filed Sep. 3 2004 the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates generally to the fields of molecular biology and growth factor regulation. More specifically the invention concerns modulators of the biological activity of integrins containing the beta7 subunit and uses of said modulators.

The integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors involved in numerous cellular processes from cell adhesion to gene regulation Hynes R. O. Cell 1992 69 11 25 and Hemler M. E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990 8 365 368 . Several integrins have been implicated in disease processes and have generated widespread interest as potential targets for drug discovery Sharar S. R. et al. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1995 16 359 378 . In the immune system integrins are involved in leukocyte trafficking adhesion and infiltration during inflammatory processes Nakajima H. et al. J. Exp. Med. 1994 179 1145 1154 . Differential expression of integrins regulates the adhesive properties of cells and different integrins are involved in different inflammatory responses. Butcher E. C. et al. Science 1996 272 60 66. The beta7 integrins i.e. alpha4beta7 4 7 and alphaEbeta7 E 7 are expressed primarily on monocytes lymphocytes eosinophils basophils and macrophages but not on neutrophils. Elices M. J. et al. Cell 1990 60 577 584. The primary ligands for 4 7 integrin are the endothelial surface proteins mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule MAdCAM and vascular cell adhesion molecule VCAM 1 Makarem R. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1994 269 4005 4011 . The binding of the 4 7 to MAdCAM and or VCAM expressed on high endothelial venules HEVs at sites of inflammation results in firm adhesion of the leukocyte to the endothelium followed by extravasation into the inflamed tissue Chuluyan H. E. et al. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1995 16 391 404 . A primary ligand for E 7 integrin is the intra epithelial lymphocyte IEL surface protein E cadherein which facilitates adherence of the E 7 bearing cell to epithelial lymphocytes. Monoclonal antibodies directed against 4 7 MAdCAM or VCAM have been shown to be effective modulators in animal models of chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma Laberge S. et al. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995 151 822 829. rheumatoid arthritis RA Barbadillo C. et al. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1995 16 375 379 colitis Viney et al J. Immunol. 1996 157 2488 2497 and inflammatory bowel diseases IBD Podalski D. K. N. Eng. J. Med. 1991 325 928 937 Powrie F. et al. Ther. Immunol. 1995 2 115 123 . Monoclonal antibodies directed against beta7 subunit have been shown to bind the integrin subunit Tidswell M. et al. 1997 J. Immunol. 159 1497 1505 but as non human or non humanized antibodies they lack clinical usefulness.

A need exists for highly specific compounds such as humanized antibodies or binding fragments thereof which inhibit the interaction between the alpha4beta7 integrin and its ligands MAdCAM and or VCAM as well as the interaction between the alphaEbeta7 integrin and its ligand E cadherin. These compounds are useful for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma Crohn s disease ulcerative colitis diabetes complications of organ transplantation and allograft related disorders.

All references cited herein including patent applications and publications are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The invention is in part based on the identification of a variety of antagonists of biological pathways involving beta7 containing integrins which are generally biological cellular processes that presents as an important and advantageous therapeutic target. Such biological pathways include without limitation inflammation particularly chronic inflammation disorders such as asthma allergy IBD diabetes transplantation and grafts versus host disorders. The invention provides compositions and methods based on interfering with beta7 integrin mediated cellular adhesion and or recruitment including but not limited to interfering with MAdCAM and VCAM 1 binding to the extracellular portion of alpha4beta7 integrin and E cadherin interaction with the alphaEbeta7 integrin intereaction. Antagonists of the invention as described herein provide important therapeutic and diagnostic agents for use in targeting pathological conditions associated with abnormal or unwanted signaling via a beta7 integrin. Accordingly the invention provides methods compositions kits and articles of manufacture related to modulating beta7 integrin mediated pathways including modulation of MAdCAM alpha4beta7 binding and leukocyte recruitment to gastrointestinal epithelium binding and allergy asthma IBD such as Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis diabetes inflammation associated with transplantation graft versus host disorder and or allograft disorders and other biological physiological activities mediated by beta7 integrin.

In one aspect the invention provides anti beta7 therapeutic agents suitable for therapeutic use and capable of effecting varying degrees of disruption of a beta7 integrin mediated pathway. For example in one embodiment the invention provides a humanized anti beta7 antibody wherein the antibody as a Fab fragment has substantially the same binding affinity to human beta7 as a murine Fab fragment comprising consisting or consisting essentially of a light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequence as depicted in or . In another embodiment the invention provides a humanized anti beta7 antibody wherein the antibody as a Fab fragment has a binding affinity to human beta7 that is lower for example at least 3 at least 5 at least 7 or at least 10 fold lower than that of a murine or rat Fab fragment comprising consisting or consisting essentially of a light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequence as depicted in or the variable domain sequences depicted in . Alternatively a humanized anti beta7 antibody or beta7 binding fragment thereof of the invention exhibits monovalent affinity to human beta7 which affinity is substantially the same as or greater than monovalent affinity to human beta7 of an antibody comprising light chain and heavy chain variable sequences as depicted in SEQ ID NO 10 and or SEQ ID NO 11 or SEQ ID NO 12 and or SEQ ID NO 13 . The antibody or binding fragment thereof having great affinity to human beta7 exhibits an affinity which is at least 2 fold at least 5 fold at least 10 fold at least 50 fold at least 100 fold at least 500 fold at least 1000 fold at least 5000 fold or at least 10 000 fold greater than an antibody comprising the light chain and heavy chain sequences depicted in SEQ ID NO 10 and or SEQ ID NO 11 or SEQ ID NO 12 and or SEQ ID NO 13 .

In another embodiment the invention provides an anti beta7 humanized antibody wherein the antibody as a Fab fragment has a binding affinity to human beta7 that is greater for example at least 3 at least 5 at least 7 at least 9 at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 or at least 100 fold greater than that of a rodent such as rat or murine Fab fragment comprising consisting or consisting essentially of a light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequence as depicted in and respectively. In one embodiment said rodent Fab fragment has the binding affinity of a Fab fragment comprising variable domain sequences of a rat antibody designated FIB504.64 produced by hybridoma cell line deposited under American Type Culture Collection Accession Number ATCC HB 293. In a further embodiment a humanized Fab fragment of the invention has the binding affinity of a Fab fragment comprising variable domain sequences of an antibody produced by anyone of the humanized anti beta7 antibodies of the invention. As is well established in the art binding affinity of a ligand to its receptor can be determined using any of a variety of assays and expressed in terms of a variety of quantitative values. Accordingly in one embodiment the binding affinity is expressed as Kd values and reflects intrinsic binding affinity e.g. with minimized avidity effects . Generally and preferably binding affinity is measured in vitro whether in a cell free or cell associated setting. As described in greater detail herein fold difference in binding affinity can be quantified in terms of the ratio of the binding affinity value of a humanized antibody in Fab form and the binding affinity value of a reference comparator Fab antibody e.g. a murine antibody having donor hypervariable region sequences wherein the binding affinity values are determined under similar assay conditions. Thus in one embodiment the fold difference in binding affinity is determined as the ratio of the Kd values of the humanized antibody in Fab form and said reference comparator Fab antibody. Any of a number of assays known in the art including those described herein can be used to obtain binding affinity measurements including for example Biacore Biacore International Ab Uppsala Sweden and ELISA.

These effects can be modulated by any biologically relevant mechanism including disruption of ligand binding to beta7 subunit or to the alpha4beta7 or alphaEbeta dimeric integrin and or by disrupting association between the alpha and beta integrin subunits such that formation of the dimeric integrin is inhibited.

For example in one embodiment the invention provides a humanized antibody that elicits and or is expected to elicit a human anti rat or human anti mouse or human anti human antibody response at a substantially reduced level compared to an antibody comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NOS 10 11 12 and or SEQ ID NO 13 rat anti mouse Fib504 ATCC HB 293 in a host subject.

In one embodiment the heavy chain variable domain of an antibody of the invention comprises a human consensus framework sequence which in one embodiment is the subgroup III consensus framework sequence. In one embodiment an antibody of the invention comprises a variant subgroup III consensus framework sequence modified at least one amino acid position. For example in one embodiment a variant subgroup III consensus framework sequence may comprise a substitution at one or more of positions 71 73 78 and or 94 although position 94 is part of an extended heavy chain hypervariable region H3 of the present invention. In one embodiment said substitution is R71A N73T N78A and or R94M in any combination thereof.

In one embodiment an antibody of the invention comprises at least a portion or all of human subgroup I framework consensus sequence.

Antagonists of the invention can be used to modulate one or more aspects of beta7 associated effects. For example a beta7 antagonist antibody may bind to beta7 within a sequence of the alpha4beta7 or alphaEbeta7 dimerization region and thereby inhibit interaction of the integrin subunits and formation of an integrin dimer. In a further example a beta7 antagonist antibody may bind to a sequence within the ligand binding domain of beta7 subunit and thereby inhibit interaction of said bound domain with its binding partner such as fibronectin VCAM and or MAdCAM for the alpha4beta7 integrin or E cadherin for the alphaEbeta7 integrin . In another example a beta7 antagonist antibody may bind to a sequence that is not within the integrin subunit dimerization domain or a ligand binding domain but wherein said beta7 antagonist antibody binding results in disruption of the ability of the beta7 domain to interact with its binding partner such as an alpha4 or alphaE integrin subunit and or a ligand such as fibronectin VCAM MAdCAM or E cadherein . In one embodiment an antagonist antibody of the invention binds to beta7 for example the extracellular domain such that beta7 dimerization with the alpha4 or alphaE subunit is disrupted. In one embodiment an antagonist antibody of the invention binds to beta7 such that ability of beta7 and or an alpha4beta7 and or an alphaEbeta7 integrin to bind to its respective ligand or ligands is disrupted. For example in one embodiment the invention provides an antagonist antibody which upon binding to a beta7 molecule inhibits dimerization of said molecule. In one embodiment a beta7 antagonist antibody of the invention specifically binds a sequence in the ligand binding domain of beta7. In one embodiment a beta7 antagonist antibody of the invention specifically binds a sequence in the ligand binding domain of beta7 such that ligand binding i.e. fibronectin VCAM and or MAdCAM to the alpha4beta7 integrin is disrupted.

In one embodiment an antagonist antibody of the invention disrupts beta7 dimerization comprising heterodimerization i.e. beta7 dimerization with an alpha4 or alphaE integrin subunit molecule.

In some instances it may be advantageous to have a beta7 antagonist antibody that does not interfere with binding of a ligand such as fibronectin VCAM MAdCAM or alphaE to beta7 subunit as part of an integrin or to an alpha4beta7 integrin or an alphaEbeta7 integrin as a dimer. Accordingly in one embodiment the invention provides an antibody that does not bind a fibronectin VCAM MAdCAM or E cadherin binding site on beta7 but instead inhibits interaction between beta7 subunit and an alpha subunit such as alpha4 or alphaE integrin subunit such that a biologically active integrin is prevented from forming. In one example an antagonist antibody of the invention can be used in conjunction with one or more other antagonists wherein the antagonists are targeted at different processes and or functions within the beta7 integrin axis. Thus in one embodiment a beta7 antagonist antibody of the invention binds to an epitope on beta7 distinct from an epitope bound by another beta7 or an alpha beta integrin antagonist such as an alpha4beta7 antibody including monoclonal antibody or an antibody such as a humanized antibody or monoclonal antibody derived from and or having the same or effectively the same binding characteristics or specificity as an antibody derived from a murine antibody.

In one embodiment the invention provides a beta7 antagonist antibody that disrupts beta7 alpha4 or alphaE multimerization into the respective integrin as well as ligand binding. For example an antagonist antibody of the invention that inhibits beta7 dimerization with alpha4 or alphaE integrin subunit may further comprise an ability to compete with ligand for binding to beta7 or the integrin dimer e.g. it may interfere with the binding of fibronectin VCAM and or MAdCAM to beta7 and or alpha4beta7 or it may interfere with the binding of E cadherin to beta7 or alphaEbeta7.

 VCAM 1 or vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 CD106 refers to a ligand of alpha4beta7 and alpha4beta1 expressed on activated endothelium and important in endothelial leukocyte interactions such as binding and transmigration of leukocytes during inflammation.

 E cadherin refers to a member of the family of cadherins where E cadherin is expressed on epithelial cells. E cadherin is a ligand of the alphaEbeta7 integrin and mediates binding of iEL expressed alphaEbeta7 to intestinal epithelium although its function in lymphocyte homing is unclear. E cadherin expression is upregulated by TGF beta1.

 Fibronectin refers to Fibronectin is involved in tissue repair embryogenesis blood clotting and cell migration adhesion. It serves as a linker in the ECM extracellular matrix and as dimer found in the plasma plasma fibronectin . The plasma form is synthesized by hepatocytes while the ECM form is made by fibroblasts chondrocytes endothelial cells macrophages as well as certain epithelial cells. In this context it interacts with the alpha4beta7 integrin to mediate aspects of lymphocyte homing or adhesion. The ECM form of fibronectin serves as a general cell adhesion molecule by anchoring cells to collagen or proteoglycan substrates. Fibronectin also can serve to organize cellular interaction with the ECM by binding to different components of the extracellular matrix and to membrane bound fibronectin receptors on cell surfaces. Finally fibronectin is important in cell migration events during embryogenesis.

 Gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders are a group of chronic disorders that cause inflammation and or ulceration in the mucous membrane. These disorders include for example inflammatory bowel disease e.g. Crohn s disease ulcerative colitis indeterminate colitis and infectious colitis mucositis e.g. oral mucositis gastrointestinal mucositis nasal mucositis and proctitis necrotizing enterocolitis and esophagitis.

 Inflammatory Bowel Disease or IBD is used interchangeably herein to refer to diseases of the bowel that cause inflammation and or ulceration and includes without limitation Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis.

 Crohn s disease CD or ulcerative colitis UC are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases of unknown etiology. Crohn s disease unlike ulcerative colitis can affect any part of the bowel. The most prominent feature Crohn s disease is the granular reddish purple edmatous thickening of the bowel wall. With the development of inflammation these granulomas often lose their circumscribed borders and integrate with the surrounding tissue. Diarrhea and obstruction of the bowel are the predominant clinical features. As with ulcerative colitis the course of Crohn s disease may be continuous or relapsing mild or severe but unlike ulcerative colitis Crohn s disease is not curable by resection of the involved segment of bowel. Most patients with Crohn s disease require surgery at some point but subsequent relapse is common and continuous medical treatment is usual.

Crohn s disease may involve any part of the alimentary tract from the mouth to the anus although typically it appears in the ileocolic small intestinal or colonic anorectal regions. Histopathologically the disease manifests by discontinuous granulomatomas crypt abscesses fissures and aphthous ulcers. The inflammatory infiltrate is mixed consisting of lymphocytes both T and B cells plasma cells macrophages and neutrophils. There is a disproportionate increase in IgM and IgG secreting plasma cells macrophages and neutrophils.

Anti inflammatory drugs sulfasalazine and 5 aminosalisylic acid 5 ASA are useful for treating mildly active colonic Crohn s disease and is commonly prescribed to maintain remission of the disease. Metroidazole and ciprofloxacin are similar in efficacy to sulfasalazine and appear to be particularly useful for treating perianal disease. In more severe cases corticosteroids are effective in treating active exacerbations and can even maintain remission. Azathioprine and 6 mercaptopurine have also shown success in patients who require chronic administration of cortico steroids. It is also possible that these drugs may play a role in the long term prophylaxis. Unfortunately there can be a very long delay up to six months before onset of action in some patients.

Antidiarrheal drugs can also provide symptomatic relief in some patients. Nutritional therapy or elemental diet can improve the nutritional status of patients and induce symptomatic improvement of acute disease but it does not induce sustained clinical remissions. Antibiotics are used in treating secondary small bowel bacterial overgrowth and in treatment of pyogenic complications.

 Ulcerative colitis UC afflicts the large intestine. The course of the disease may be continuous or relapsing mild or severe. The earliest lesion is an inflammatory infiltration with abscess formation at the base of the crypts of Lieberk hn. Coalescence of these distended and ruptured crypts tends to separate the overlying mucosa from its blood supply leading to ulceration. Symptoms of the disease include cramping lower abdominal pain rectal bleeding and frequent loose discharges consisting mainly of blood pus and mucus with scanty fecal particles. A total colectomy may be required for acute severe or chronic unremitting ulcerative colitis.

The clinical features of UC are highly variable and the onset may be insidious or abrupt and may include diarrhea tenesmus and relapsing rectal bleeding. With fulminant involvement of the entire colon toxic megacolon a life threatening emergency may occur. Extraintestinal manifestations include arthritis pyoderma gangrenoum uveitis and erythema nodosum.

Treatment for UC includes sulfasalazine and related salicylate containing drugs for mild cases and corticosteroid drugs in severe cases. Topical administration of either salicylates or corticosteroids is sometimes effective particularly when the disease is limited to the distal bowel and is associated with decreased side effects compared with systemic use. Supportive measures such as administration of iron and antidiarrheal agents are sometimes indicated. Azathioprine 6 mercaptopurine and methotrexate are sometimes also prescribed for use in refractory corticosteroid dependent cases.

A modification of an amino acid residue position as used herein refers to a change of a primary amino acid sequence as compared to a starting amino acid sequence wherein the change results from a sequence alteration involving said amino acid residue positions. For example typical modifications include substitution of the residue or at said position with another amino acid e.g. a conservative or non conservative substitution insertion of one or more generally fewer than 5 or 3 amino acids adjacent to said residue position and deletion of said residue position. An amino acid substitution or variation thereof refers to the replacement of an existing amino acid residue in a predetermined starting amino acid sequence with a different amino acid residue. Generally and preferably the modification results in alteration in at least one physicobiochemical activity of the variant polypeptide compared to a polypeptide comprising the starting or wild type amino acid sequence. For example in the case of an antibody a physicobiochemical activity that is altered can be binding affinity binding capability and or binding effect upon a target molecule.

The term amino acid within the scope of the present invention is used in its broadest sense and is meant to include the naturally occurring L amino acids or residues. The commonly used one and three letter abbreviations for naturally occurring amino acids are used herein Lehninger A. L. 2d ed. pp. 71 92 Worth Publishers New York N.Y. 1975 . The term includes D amino acids as well as chemically modified amino acids such as amino acid analogs naturally occurring amino acids that are not usually incorporated into proteins such as norleucine and chemically synthesized compounds having properties known in the art to be characteristic of an amino acid. For example analogs or mimetics of phenylalanine or proline which allow the same conformational restriction of the peptide compounds as natural Phe or Pro are included within the definition of amino acid. Such analogs and mimetics are referred to herein as functional equivalents of an amino acid. Other examples of amino acids are listed by Roberts and Vellaccio Gross and Meiehofer Eds. Vol. 5 p. 341 Academic Press Inc. New York N.Y. 1983 which is incorporated herein by reference. Where a single letter is used to designate one of the naturally occurring amino acid the designations are as commonly found in the relevant literature see for example Alberts B. et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell 3rd ed. Garland Publishing Inc. 1994 page 57 .

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

The phrase substantially similar or substantially the same as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference comparator antibody such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kd values . The difference between said two values is preferably less than about 50 preferably less than about 40 preferably less than about 30 preferably less than about 20 preferably less than about 10 as a function of the value for the reference comparator antibody.

 Binding affinity generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant Kd . Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily whereas high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.

In one embodiment the Kd or Kd value according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate Chen et al. 1999 293 865 881 . To establish conditions for the assay microtiter plates Dynex are coated overnight with 5 ug ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbant plate Nunc 269620 100 pM or 26 pM I antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest e.g. consistent with assessment of an anti VEGF antibody Fab 12 in Presta et al. 1997 57 4593 4599 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature e.g. for one hour . The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 Tween 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 ul well of scintillant MicroScint 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 ug ml 0.2 uM before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 293 865 881. If the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stir red cuvette.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to a peptide or polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein however amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2 wherein the complete source code for the ALIGN 2 program is provided in Table A below. The ALIGN 2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech Inc. and the source code shown in Table A below has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN 2 program is publicly available through Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. or may be compiled from the source code provided in below. The ALIGN 2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN 2 program and do not vary.

In situations where ALIGN 2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons the amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to with or against a given amino acid sequence B which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain amino acid sequence identity to with or against a given amino acid sequence B is calculated as follows 100 times the fraction X Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN 2 in that program s alignment of A and B and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B the amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the amino acid sequence identity of B to A.

Unless specifically stated otherwise all amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN 2 computer program.

The term vector as used herein is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply recombinant vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.

 Polynucleotide or nucleic acid as used interchangeably herein refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides ribonucleotides modified nucleotides or bases and or their analogs or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include for example caps substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog internucleotide modifications such as for example those with uncharged linkages e.g. methyl phosphonates phosphotriesters phosphoamidates carbamates etc. and with charged linkages e.g. phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates etc. those containing pendant moieties such as for example proteins e.g. nucleases toxins antibodies signal peptides ply L lysine etc. those with intercalators e.g. acridine psoralen etc. those containing chelators e.g. metals radioactive metals boron oxidative metals etc. those containing alkylators those with modified linkages e.g. alpha anomeric nucleic acids etc. as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide s . Further any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced for example by phosphonate groups phosphate groups protected by standard protecting groups or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides or may be conjugated to solid or semi solid supports. The 5 and 3 terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art including for example 2 O methyl 2 O allyl 2 fluoro or 2 azido ribose carbocyclic sugar analogs .alpha. anomeric sugars epimeric sugars such as arabinose xyloses or lyxoses pyranose sugars furanose sugars sedoheptuloses acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include but are not limited to embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P O S thioate P S S dithioate O NR.sub.2 amidate P O R P O OR CO or CH.sub.2 formacetal in which each R or R is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl 1 20 C. optionally containing an ether O linkage aryl alkenyl cycloalkyl cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein including RNA and DNA.

 Oligonucleotide as used herein generally refers to short generally single stranded generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally but not necessarily less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms oligonucleotide and polynucleotide are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.

The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies for example full length or intact monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multivalent antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity and may also include certain antibody fragments as described in greater detail herein . An antibody can be human humanized and or affinity matured.

 Antibody fragments comprise only a portion of an intact antibody wherein the portion preferably retains at least one preferably most or all of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment an antibody fragment for example one that comprises the Fc region retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody such as FcRn binding antibody half life modulation ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For example such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigen. Furthermore in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen.

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 .

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

An antigen is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide carbohydrate nucleic acid lipid hapten or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably the target antigen is a polypeptide. An acceptor human framework for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or from a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof or may contain pre existing amino acid sequence changes. Where pre existing amino acid changes are present preferably no more than 5 and preferably 4 or less or 3 or less pre existing amino acid changes are present. Where pre existing amino acid changes are present in a VH preferably those changes are only at three two or one of positions 71H 73H and 78H for instance the amino acid residues at those positions may be 71A 73T and or 78A. In one embodiment the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.

A human consensus framework is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residue in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment for the VL the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment for the VH the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al.

A VL subgroup I consensus framework comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al. In one embodiment the VL subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences DIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITC SEQ ID NO 34 L1 WYQQKPGKAPKLLI SEQ ID NO 35 L2 GVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISSLQPEDFATYYC SEQ ID NO 36 L3 FGQGTKVEIKR SEQ ID NO 37 

A VH subgroup III consensus framework comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al. In one embodiment the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS SEQ ID NO 38 H1 WVRQAPGKGLEWV SEQ ID NO 39 H2 RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA SEQ ID NO 40 H3 WGQGTLVTVSS SEQ ID NO 41 .

An unmodified human framework is a human framework which has the same amino acid sequence as the acceptor human framework e.g. lacking human to non human amino acid substitution s in the acceptor human framework.

An altered hypervariable region for the purposes herein is a hypervariable region comprising one or more e.g. one to about 16 amino acid substitution s therein.

An un modified hypervariable region for the purposes herein is a hypervariable region having the same amino acid sequence as a non human antibody from which it was derived i.e. one which lacks one or more amino acid substitutions therein.

The term hypervariable region HVR or HV when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions three in the VH H1 H2 H3 and three in the VL L1 L2 L3 . A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted below.

Hypervariable regions may comprise extended hypervariable regions as follows 24 36 or 24 34 L1 46 56 or 49 56 or 50 56 or 52 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the VL and 26 35 H1 50 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al. supra for each of these definitions.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues.

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and or framework residues is described by Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al 226 889 896 1992 .

An effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.

A therapeutically effective amount of a substance molecule of the invention agonist or antagonist may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the individual and the ability of the substance molecule agonist or antagonist to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance molecule agonist or antagonist are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell whose growth is dependent upon beta7 activation either in vitro or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of beta7 dependent cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine taxanes and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C. Further information can be found in Mendelsohn and Israel eds. Chapter 1 entitled Cell cycle regulation oncogenes and antineoplastic drugs by Murakami et al. WB Saunders Philadelphia 1995 especially p. 13. The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel TAXOTERE Rhone Poulenc Rorer derived from the European yew is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel TAXOL Bristol Myers Squibb . Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.

 Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic. The full chemical name of doxorubicin is 8S cis 10 3 amino 2 3 6 trideoxy L lyxo hexapyranosyl oxy 7 8 9 10 tetrahydro 6 8 11 trihydroxy 8 hydroxyacetyl 1 methoxy 5 12 naphthacenedione.

Compounds useful in combination therapy with an antagonist anti beta7 antibody of the invention include antibodies including without limitation other anti beta7 antagonist antibodies Fib 21 22 27 30 Tidswell M. 1997 supra or humanized derivatives thereof anti alpha4 antibodies such as ANTEGEN anti TNF REMICADE or non protein compounds including without limitation 5 ASA compounds ASACOL PENTASA ROWASA COLAZAL and other compounds such as Purinethol and steroids such as prednisone. In an embodiment the invention encompasses a method of treating a patient such as a human patient with the antagonist anti beta7 antibody of the invention alone or in combination with a second compound that is also useful in treating inflammation. In one embodiment the second compound is selected from the group consisting of Fib 21 22 27 30 or humanized derivatives thereof anti alpha4 antibodies ANTEGEN anti TNF REMICADE 5 ASA compounds ASACOL PENTASA ROWASA COLAZAL Purinethol steroids and prednisone. In one embodiment of the invention administration of the antagonist anti beta7 antibody of the invention substantially reduces the dose of the second compound. In one embodiment said reduction in the dose of the second compound is at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 95 . In one embodiment of the invention the combination of the antibody of the invention and the reduced dose of the second compound relieves symptoms in the patient to substantially the same degree or better than administration of the second compound alone.

Reduction or elimination of a HAMA human anti mouse also applicable to human anti rat or human anti human response is a significant aspect of clinical development of suitable therapeutic agents. See e.g. Khaxzaeli et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988 80 937 Jaffers et al. Transplantation 1986 41 572 Shawler et al. J. Immunol. 1985 135 1530 Sears et al. J. Biol. Response Mod. 1984 3 138 Miller et al. Blood 1983 62 988 Hakimi et al. J. Immunol. 1991 147 1352 Reichmann et al. Nature 1988 332 323 Junghans et al. Cancer Res. 1990 50 1495. As described herein the invention provides antibodies that are humanized such that HAMA response is reduced or eliminated. Variants of these antibodies can further be obtained using routine methods known in the art some of which are further described below.

For example an amino acid sequence from an antibody as described herein can serve as a starting parent sequence for diversification of the framework and or hypervariable sequence s . A selected framework sequence to which a starting hypervariable sequence is linked is referred to herein as an acceptor human framework. While the acceptor human frameworks may be from or derived from a human immunoglobulin the VL and or VH regions thereof preferably the acceptor human frameworks are from or derived from a human consensus framework sequence as such frameworks have been demonstrated to have minimal or no immunogenicity in human patients.

Where the acceptor is derived from a human immunoglobulin one may optionally select a human framework sequence that is selected based on its homology to the donor framework sequence by aligning the donor framework sequence with various human framework sequences in a collection of human framework sequences and select the most homologous framework sequence as the acceptor.

In one embodiment human consensus frameworks herein are from or derived from VH subgroup III and or VL kappa subgroup I consensus framework sequences.

Thus the VH acceptor human framework may comprise one two three or all of the following framework sequences 

RFTISXaa1DXaa2SK.NTXaa3YLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA SEQ ID NO 42 wherein Xaa1 is A or R Xaa2 is T or N and Xaa3 is A L or F 

In one embodiment the VH acceptor human framework comprises one two three or all of the following framework sequences 

FR3 comprising FR3 comprises RFTISADTSKNTAYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA SEQ ID NO 43 RFTISRDTSKNTAYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA SEQ ID NO 44 RFTISRDTSKNTFYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA SEQ ID NO 45 RFTISADTSKNTFYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA SEQ ID NO 46 

The VL acceptor human framework may comprise one two three or all of the following framework sequences 

While the acceptor may be identical in sequence to the human framework sequence selected whether that is from a human immunoglobulin or a human consensus framework the present invention contemplates that the acceptor sequence may comprise pre existing amino acid substitutions relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or human consensus framework sequence. These pre existing substitutions are preferably minimal usually four three two or one amino acid differences only relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or consensus framework sequence.

Hypervariable region residues of the non human antibody are incorporated into the VL and or VH acceptor human frameworks. For example one may incorporate residues corresponding to the Kabat CDR residues the Chothia hypervariable loop residues the Abm residues and or contact residues. Optionally the extended hypervariable region residues as follows are incorporated 24 34 L1 49 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 26 35 H1 50 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 .

While incorporation of hypervariable region residues is discussed herein it will be appreciated that this can be achieved in various ways for example nucleic acid encoding the desired amino acid sequence can be generated by mutating nucleic acid encoding the mouse variable domain sequence so that the framework residues thereof are changed to acceptor human framework residues or by mutating nucleic acid encoding the human variable domain sequence so that the hypervariable domain residues are changed to non human residues or by synthesizing nucleic acid encoding the desired sequence etc.

In the examples herein hypervariable region grafted variants were generated by Kunkel mutagenesis of nucleic acid encoding the human acceptor sequences using a separate oligonucleotide for each hypervariable region. Kunkel et al. 154 367 382 1987 . Appropriate changes can be introduced within the framework and or hypervariable region using routine techniques to correct and re establish proper hypervariable region antigen interactions.

Phage mid display also referred to herein as phage display in some contexts can be used as a convenient and fast method for generating and screening many different potential variant antibodies in a library generated by sequence randomization. However other methods for making and screening altered antibodies are available to the skilled person.

Phage mid display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting novel proteins which bind to a ligand such as an antigen. Using the techniques of phage mid display allows the generation of large libraries of protein variants which can be rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are generally fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phagemid display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been developed. Bass S. 8 309 1990 Lowman and Wells 3 205 1991 . In a monovalent phagemid display system the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 723 286 U.S. Pat. No. 5 432 018 U.S. Pat. No. 5 580 717 U.S. Pat. No. 5 427 908 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 498 530 .

Libraries of antibodies or antigen binding polypeptides have been prepared in a number of ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or by cloning a family of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage mid display have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 750 373 5 733 743 5 837 242 5 969 108 6 172 197 5 580 717 and 5 658 727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or antigen binding proteins with the desired characteristics.

Methods of substituting an amino acid of choice into a template nucleic acid are well established in the art some of which are described herein. For example hypervariable region residues can be substituted using the Kunkel method. See for example Kunkel et al. 154 367 382 1987 .

The sequence of oligonucleotides includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the hypervariable region residues to be altered. A codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. Codon sets can be represented using symbols to designate particular nucleotides or equimolar mixtures of nucleotides as shown in below according to the IUB code.

For example in the codon set DVK D can be nucleotides A or G or T V can be A or G or C and K can be G or T. This codon set can present 18 different codons and can encode amino acids Ala Trp Tyr Lys Thr Asn Lys Ser Arg Asp Glu Gly and Cys.

Oligonucleotide or primer sets can be synthesized using standard methods. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized for example by solid phase synthesis containing sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide degeneracy at certain positions is well known in that art. Such sets of nucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers available from for example Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. or can be obtained commercially for example from Life Technologies Rockville Md. . Therefore a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides as used according to the invention have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can include restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes.

In one method nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids can be created by oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis. This technique is well known in the art as described by Zoller et al. 10 6487 6504 1987 . Briefly nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids are created by hybridizing an oligonucleotide set encoding the desired codon sets to a DNA template where the template is the single stranded form of the plasmid containing a variable region nucleic acid template sequence. After hybridization DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the oligonucleotide primer and will contain the codon sets as provided by the oligonucleotide set.

Generally oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used. An optimal oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on either side of the nucleotide s coding for the mutation s . This ensures that the oligonucleotide will hybridize properly to the single stranded DNA template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using techniques known in the art such as that described by Crea et al. 75 5765 1978 .

The DNA template is generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors the commercially available M13mp18 and M13mp19 vectors are suitable or those vectors that contain a single stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153 3 1987 . Thus the DNA that is to be mutated can be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single stranded template. Production of the single stranded template is described in sections 4.21 4.41 of Sambrook et al. above.

To alter the native DNA sequence the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the single stranded template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA polymerizing enzyme usually T7 DNA polymerase or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I is then added to synthesize the complementary strand of the template using the oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis. A heteroduplex molecule is thus formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of gene 1 and the other strand the original template encodes the native unaltered sequence of gene 1. This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell usually a prokaryote such as JM101. After growing the cells they are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the oligonucleotide primer radiolabelled with a 32 Phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that contain the mutated DNA.

The method described immediately above may be modified such that a homoduplex molecule is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the mutation s . The modifications are as follows The single stranded oligonucleotide is annealed to the single stranded template as described above. A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides deoxyriboadenosine dATP deoxyriboguanosine dGTP and deoxyribothymidine dTT is combined with a modified thiodeoxyribocytosine called dCTP aS which can be obtained from Amersham . This mixture is added to the template oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this mixture a strand of DNA identical to the template except for the mutated bases is generated. In addition this new strand of DNA will contain dCTP aS instead of dCTP which serves to protect it from restriction endonuclease digestion. After the template strand of the double stranded heteroduplex is nicked with an appropriate restriction enzyme the template strand can be digested with ExoIII nuclease or another appropriate nuclease past the region that contains the site s to be mutagenized. The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that is only partially single stranded. A complete double stranded DNA homoduplex is then formed using DNA polymerase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates ATP and DNA ligase. This homoduplex molecule can then be transformed into a suitable host cell.

As indicated previously the sequence of the oligonucleotide set is of sufficient length to hybridize to the template nucleic acid and may also but does not necessarily contain restriction sites. The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors or vectors that contain a single stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153 3 1987 . Thus the DNA that is to be mutated must be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single stranded template. Production of the single stranded template is described in sections 4.21 4.41 of Sambrook et al. supra.

According to another method a library can be generated by providing upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets each set having a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences the different sequences established by the codon sets provided within the sequence of the oligonucleotides. The upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets along with a variable domain template nucleic acid sequence can be used in a polymerase chain reaction to generate a library of PCR products. The PCR products can be referred to as nucleic acid cassettes as they can be fused with other related or unrelated nucleic acid sequences for example viral coat proteins and dimerization domains using established molecular biology techniques.

The sequence of the PCR primers includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the solvent accessible and highly diverse positions in a hypervariable region. As described above a codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids.

Antibody selectants that meet the desired criteria as selected through appropriate screening selection steps can be isolated and cloned using standard recombinant techniques.

For recombinant production of an antibody of the invention the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody . Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally preferred host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic generally mammalian origin.

Polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components depending on its function amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide or both and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include but are not limited to an origin of replication a selection marker gene a promoter a ribosome binding site RBS a signal sequence the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.

In general plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example E. coli is typically transformed using pBR322 a plasmid derived from an species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin Amp and tetracycline Tet resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322 its derivatives or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain or be modified to contain promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237.

In addition phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example bacteriophage such as GEM.TM. 11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as LE392.

The expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter cistron pairs encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream 5 to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.

A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments heterologous promoters are utilized as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.

Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter the galactamase and lactose promoter systems a tryptophan trp promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However other promoters that are functional in bacteria such as other known bacterial or phage promoters are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains Siebenlist et al. 1980 Cell 20 269 using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.

In one aspect of the invention each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase Ipp or heat stable enterotoxin II STII leaders LamB PhoE PelB OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.

In another aspect the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains e.g. the trxB strains provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. Proba and Pluckthun 159 203 1995 .

The present invention provides an expression system in which the quantitative ratio of expressed polypeptide components can be modulated in order to maximize the yield of secreted and properly assembled antibodies of the invention. Such modulation is accomplished at least in part by simultaneously modulating translational strengths for the polypeptide components.

One technique for modulating translational strength is disclosed in Simmons et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 840 523. It utilizes variants of the translational initiation region TIR within a cistron. For a given TIR a series of amino acid or nucleic acid sequence variants can be created with a range of translational strengths thereby providing a convenient means by which to adjust this factor for the desired expression level of the specific chain. TIR variants can be generated by conventional mutagenesis techniques that result in codon changes which can alter the amino acid sequence although silent changes in the nucleotide sequence are preferred. Alterations in the TIR can include for example alterations in the number or spacing of Shine Dalgarno sequences along with alterations in the signal sequence. One method for generating mutant signal sequences is the generation of a codon bank at the beginning of a coding sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the signal sequence i.e. the changes are silent . This can be accomplished by changing the third nucleotide position of each codon additionally some amino acids such as leucine serine and arginine have multiple first and second positions that can add complexity in making the bank. This method of mutagenesis is described in detail in Yansura et al. 1992 4 151 158.

Preferably a set of vectors is generated with a range of TIR strengths for each cistron therein. This limited set provides a comparison of expression levels of each chain as well as the yield of the desired antibody products under various TIR strength combinations. TIR strengths can be determined by quantifying the expression level of a reporter gene as described in detail in Simmons et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 840 523. Based on the translational strength comparison the desired individual TIRs are selected to be combined in the expression vector constructs of the invention.

Prokaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include e.g. Bacilli e.g. Enterobacteria species e.g. or . In one embodiment gram negative cells are used. In one embodiment cells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of strains include strain W3110 Bachmann vol. 2 Washington D.C. American Society for Microbiology 1987 pp. 1190 1219 ATCC Deposit No. 27 325 and derivatives thereof including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 fhuA tonA ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ompT nmpc fepE degP41 kan U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 635 . Other strains and derivatives thereof such as 294 ATCC 31 446 B 1776 ATCC 31 537 and RV308 ATCC 31 608 are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in for example Bass et al. 8 309 314 1990 . It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example or species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322 pBR325 pACYC177 or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

Transformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.

Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth LB plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments the media also contains a selection agent chosen based on the construction of the expression vector to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.

Any necessary supplements besides carbon nitrogen and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione cysteine cystamine thioglycollate dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.

The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For growth for example the preferred temperature ranges from about 20 C. to about 39 C. more preferably from about 25 C. to about 37 C. even more preferably at about 30 C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9 depending mainly on the host organism. For the pH is preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4 and more preferably about 7.0.

If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate limiting medium for induction. Preferably the phosphate limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium see for example Simmons et al. 2002 263 133 147 . A variety of other inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art.

In one embodiment the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism generally by such means as osmotic shock sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified for example by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE and Western blot assay.

In one aspect of the invention antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large scale fed batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity preferably about 1 000 to 100 000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients especially glucose the preferred carbon energy source . Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.

In a fermentation process induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density e.g. an ODof about 180 220 at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12 50 hours although longer or shorter induction time may be used.

To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins such as Dsb proteins DsbA DsbB DsbC DsbD and or DsbG or FkpA a peptidylprolyl cis trans isomerase with chaperone activity can be used to co transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. 1999 274 19601 19605 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 083 715 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 027 888 Bothmann and Pluckthun 2000 275 17100 17105 Ramm and Pluckthun 2000 275 17106 17113 Arie et al. 2001 39 199 210.

To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins especially those that are proteolytically sensitive certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation s in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III OmpT DegP Tsp Protease I Protease Mi Protease V Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some protease deficient strains are available and described in for example Joly et al. 1998 supra Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 264 365 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 508 192 Hara et al. 2 63 72 1996 .

In one embodiment strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.

In one embodiment the antibody protein produced herein is further purified to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion exchange columns ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE chromatofocusing SDS PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration using for example Sephadex G 75.

In one aspect Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the full length antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41 kD cell wall protein from which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et al 1983 62 1 13. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized is preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface more preferably a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications the column has been coated with a reagent such as glycerol in an attempt to prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.

As the first step of purification the preparation derived from the cell culture as described above is applied onto the Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase is then washed to remove contaminants non specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.

The vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of the following a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence.

A vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders for example the herpes simplex gD signal are available.

Generally an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.

Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies where relevant or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.

One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.

Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid such as DHFR thymidine kinase metallothionein I and II preferably primate metallothionein genes adenosine deaminase ornithine decarboxylase etc.

For example cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate Mtx a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity e.g. ATCC CRL 9096 .

Alternatively host cells particularly wild type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR transformed or co transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody wild type DHFR protein and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3 phosphotransferase APH can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic e.g. kanamycin neomycin or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 965 199.

Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody polypeptide nucleic acid. Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually alleukaryotic genes have an AT rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3 end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3 end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.

Antibody polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 419 446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 601 978. See also Reyes et al. 297 598 601 1982 on expression of human interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.

Transcription of DNA encoding the antibody polypeptide of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv 297 17 18 1982 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the antibody polypeptide encoding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells will typically also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94 11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK ATCC CCL 10 Chinese hamster ovary cells DHFR CHO Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 ATCC CCL 70 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 ATCC CRL 1587 human cervical carcinoma cells HELA ATCC CCL 2 canine kidney cells MDCK ATCC CCL 34 buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A ATCC CRL 1442 human lung cells W138 ATCC CCL 75 human liver cells Hep G2 HB 8065 mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 ATCC CCL51 TR1 cells Mather et al. 383 44 68 1982 MRC 5 cells FS4 cells and a human hepatoma line Hep G2 .

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. USA Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Pat. Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25M salt .

The antibodies of the present invention can be characterized for their physical chemical properties and biological functions by various assays known in the art.

The purified immunoglobulins can be further characterized by a series of assays including but not limited to N terminal sequencing amino acid analysis non denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC mass spectrometry ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.

In certain embodiments of the invention the immunoglobulins produced herein are analyzed for their biological activity. In some embodiments the immunoglobulins of the present invention are tested for their antigen binding activity. The antigen binding assays that are known in the art and can be used herein include without limitation any direct or competitive binding assays using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays fluorescent immunoassays and protein A immunoassays. An illustrative antigen binding assay is provided below in the Examples section.

In one embodiment the present invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses some but not all effector functions which make it a desired candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fc activities of the produced immunoglobulin are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assay for example as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art for example those described in the Examples section.

The present invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non human antibodies are known in the art. For example a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 1986 321 522 525 Riechmann et al. 1988 332 323 327 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 239 1534 1536 by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 1993 151 2296 Chothia et al. 1987 196 901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 1992 89 4285 Presta et al. 1993 151 2623.

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to one method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

In one aspect the invention provides antibody fragment comprising modifications in the interface of Fc polypeptides comprising the Fc region wherein the modifications facilitate and or promote heterodimerization. These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide wherein the protuberance is positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides. Methods of generating antibodies with these modifications are known in the art for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168.

In some embodiments amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 1989 244 1081 1085. Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid most preferably alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 2 under the heading of preferred substitutions . If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in Table 2 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes may be introduced and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in Biochemistry second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or more preferably into the remaining non conserved sites.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of the immunoglobulin polypeptides of the invention thereby generating a Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.

In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art it is contemplated that in some embodiments an antibody used in methods of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody for example in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered i.e. either improved or diminished C1q binding and or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity CDC for example as described in WO99 51642. See also Duncan Winter 322 738 40 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 260 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 and WO94 29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants.

The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates or antibody drug conjugates ADC comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin nitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids a trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In one embodiment an antibody full length or fragments of the invention is conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.

In an attempt to improve their therapeutic index maytansine and maytansinoids have been conjugated to antibodies specifically binding to tumor cell antigens. Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA. 1 maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 10HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 and Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 . The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tcor I or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcor I .Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

The compounds of the invention expressly contemplate but are not limited to ADC prepared with cross linker reagents BMPS EMCS GMBS HBVS LC SMCC MBS MPBH SBAP SIA SIAB SMCC SMPB SMPH sulfo EMCS sulfo GMBS sulfo KMUS sulfo MBS sulfo SLAB sulfo SMCC and sulfo SMPB and SVSB succinimidyl 4 vinylsulfone benzoate which are commercially available e.g. from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Rockford Ill. U.S.A . See pages 467 498 2003 2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.

In the antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody through a linker L . The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Ab L D I

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.

Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 Bioconjugate Chem. 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers prolypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymers are attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

Therapeutic formulations comprising an antibody of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 in the form of aqueous solutions lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate histidine and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG .

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsule and poly methylmethacylate microcapsule respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the immunoglobulin of the invention which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsule. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

An antibody of the present invention may be used in for example in vitro ex vivo and in vivo therapeutic methods. Antibodies of the invention can be used as an antagonist to partially or fully block the specific antigen activity in vitro ex vivo and or in vivo. Moreover at least some of the antibodies of the invention can neutralize antigen activity from other species. Accordingly the antibodies of the invention can be used to inhibit a specific antigen activity e.g. in a cell culture containing the antigen in human subjects or in other mammalian subjects having the antigen with which an antibody of the invention cross reacts e.g. chimpanzee baboon marmoset cynomolgus and rhesus pig or mouse . In one embodiment the antibody of the invention can be used for inhibiting antigen activities by contacting the antibody with the antigen such that antigen activity is inhibited. Preferably the antigen is a human protein molecule.

In one embodiment an antibody of the invention can be used in a method for inhibiting an antigen in a subject suffering from a disorder in which the antigen activity is detrimental comprising administering to the subject an antibody of the invention such that the antigen activity in the subject is inhibited. Preferably the antigen is a human protein molecule and the subject is a human subject. Alternatively the subject can be a mammal expressing the antigen with which an antibody of the invention binds. Still further the subject can be a mammal into which the antigen has been introduced e.g. by administration of the antigen or by expression of an antigen transgene . An antibody of the invention can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes. Moreover an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non human mammal expressing an antigen with which the immunoglobulin cross reacts e.g. a primate pig or mouse for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention e.g. testing of dosages and time courses of administration .

In one aspect a blocking antibody of the invention is specific to a ligand antigen and inhibits the antigen activity by blocking or interfering with the ligand receptor interaction involving the ligand antigen thereby inhibiting the corresponding signal pathway and other molecular or cellular events. The invention also features receptor specific antibodies which do not necessarily prevent ligand binding but interfere with receptor activation thereby inhibiting any responses that would normally be initiated by the ligand binding. The invention also encompasses antibodies that either preferably or exclusively bind to ligand receptor complexes. An antibody of the invention can also act as an agonist of a particular antigen receptor thereby potentiating enhancing or activating either all or partial activities of the ligand mediated receptor activation.

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate comprising an antibody conjugated with a cytotoxic agent is administered to the patient. In some embodiments the immunoconjugate and or antigen to which it is bound is are internalized by the cell resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the target cell to which it binds. In one embodiment the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the target cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents include any of the chemotherapeutic agents noted herein such as a maytansinoid or a calicheamicin a radioactive isotope or a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease.

Antibodies of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance an antibody of the invention may be co administered with another antibody chemotherapeutic agent s including cocktails of chemotherapeutic agents other cytotoxic agent s anti angiogenic agent s cytokines and or growth inhibitory agent s . Where an antibody of the invention inhibits tumor growth it may be particularly desirable to combine it with one or more other therapeutic agent s which also inhibits tumor growth. For instance an antibody of the invention may be combined with an anti VEGF antibody e.g. AVASTIN and or anti ErbB antibodies e.g. HERCEPTIN anti HER2 antibody in a treatment scheme e.g. in treating any of the diseases described herein including colorectal cancer metastatic breast cancer and kidney cancer. Alternatively or additionally the patient may receive combined radiation therapy e.g. external beam irradiation or therapy with a radioactive labeled agent such as an antibody . Such combined therapies noted above include combined administration where the two or more agents are included in the same or separate formulations and separate administration in which case administration of the antibody of the invention can occur prior to and or following administration of the adjunct therapy or therapies.

The antibody of the invention and adjunct therapeutic agent is are administered by any suitable means including parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration. In addition the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route for example by injections such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.

The antibody composition of the invention will be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibodies of the invention present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99 of the heretofore employed dosages.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention when used alone or in combination with other agents such as chemotherapeutic agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 10 mg kg of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg or 10 mg kg or any combination thereof may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week or every three weeks e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty e.g. about six doses of the antibody . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

Direct hypervariable region grafts onto the acceptor human consensus framework The phagemid used for this work pVO350 2b was a monovalent Fab g3 display vector having 2 open reading frames under control of the phoA promoter essentially as described in Lee et al. . 2004 340 5 1073 93. The first open reading frame consists of the stII signal sequence fused to the VL and CH1 domains of the acceptor light chain and the second consists of the stII signal sequence fused to the VH and CH1 domains of the acceptor heavy chain followed by a truncated form of the minor phage coat protein P3 Lowman H. et al. 1990 Biochemistry 30 10832 .

The VL and VH domains from rat Fib504 antibody FIB504.64 produced by hybridoma ATCC HB 293 American Type Culture Collection ATCC P.O. Box 1549 Manassas Va. 20108 USA were aligned with the human consensus kappa I huKI and human subgroup III consensus VH huIII domains. To make the hypervariable region HVR grafts the following frameworks were used HuKI was used for the light chain variable domain framework see . For the heavy chain variable domain framework the acceptor VH framework a modified human subgroup III humIII consensus VH domain which differs from the humIII sequence at 3 positions R71A N73T and L78A may be used see Carter et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 4285 1992 see . In generation of antibodies of the present invention the 504K RF graft was also prepared from the modified human subgroup III consensus VH domain by making the following amino acid substitutions A71R and A78F.

Hypervariable regions from rat Fib504 produced by hybridoma ATCC HB 293 antibody were engineered into the acceptor human subgroup III consensus VH framework to generate a direct HVR graft Fib504 graft see . In the VL domain the following regions from rat Fib504 were grafted to the human consensus acceptor huKI positions 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 . In the VH domain positions 26 35 H1 49 65 H2 and 94 102 H3 were grafted . In addition a second HVR graft Fib504K graft was constructed that also included within the HVR VL position 49 based on an extended definition for L2 see MacCallum et al. 262 732 745 1996 . MacCallum et al. have analyzed antibody and antigen complex crystal structures and found position 49 of the light chain and positions 49 and 94 of the heavy chain are part of the antigen contact region thus these positions were included in the definitions of HVR L2 HVR H2 and HVR H3 for humanized anti beta7 antibodies disclosed herein.

The direct graft variants were generated by Kunkel mutagenesis Kunkel et al. 1987 supra using a separate oligonucleotide for each hypervariable region. Correct clones were assessed by DNA sequencing.

Soft randomization of the hypervariable regions The process of soft randomization see U.S. Application Ser. No. 60 545 840 refers a procedure for biased mutagensis of a selected protein sequence such as a hypervariable region of an antibody. The method maintains a bias towards the murine rat or other starting hypervariable region sequence while introducing an approximately 10 50 percent mutation at each selected position. This technique increases the capacity of the library screening employed and avoids a change in the antigen epitope recognized by the antibody. According to this soft randomization technique sequence diversity is introduced into each hypervariable region using a strategy that maintains a bias towards the murine hypervariable region sequence. This was accomplished using a poisoned oligonucleotide synthesis strategy first described by Gallop et al. 37 1233 1251 1994 . However other methods for maintaining a bias towards the non human hypervariable region residue are available such as error prone PCR DNA shuffling etc.

According to the method used herein for a given position within a hypervariable region to be mutated the codon encoding the wild type amino acid is poisoned with a mixture e.g. a 70 10 10 10 mixture of nucleotides resulting in an approximately 50 percent mutation rate at each selected hypervariable region position. To achieve this the codon encoding the wild type hypervariable region amino acid to be mutated is synthesized with a low level of contaminating mixture of the other three nucleotides such as a 70 10 10 10 mixture of nucleotides. Thus by way of example for soft randomization of PRO CCG the first position synthesized is a mixture of 70 C and 10 each of G T and A the second position is a mixture of 70 C and 10 each of A G and T and the third position is a mixture of 70 G and 10 each of A C and T. It is understood that the bias can be adjusted up or down depending upon the codon being synthesized at a given position the number of codons that code for a particular amino acid and the degree that oligonucleotide synthesis is poisoned by the nucleotide composition of the synthesis mixture.

Soft randomized oligonucleotides can be patterned after the murine rat or other starting hypervariable region sequences and encompass the same regions defined by the direct hypervariable region grafts. Optionally two positions amino acids at the beginning of H2 and H3 in the VH domain may be limited in their diversity the codon RGC may be used for position 49 encoding A G S or T and at position 94 the codon AKG may be used encoding M or R.

Generation of phage libraries Randomized oligonucleotide pools designed for each hypervariable region were phosphorylated separately in six 20 l reactions containing 660 ng of oligonucleotide 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 10 mM MgCl 1 mM ATP 20 mM DTT and 5 U polynucleotide kinase for 1 h at 37 C. The six phosphorylated oligonucleotide pools were then combined with 20 g of Kunkel template in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 10 mM MgClin a final volume of 500 l resulting in an oligonucleotide to template ratio of 3. The mixture was annealed at 90 C. for 4 min 50 C. for 5 min and then cooled on ice. Excess unannealed oligonucleotide was removed with a QIAQUICK PCR purification kit Qiagen kit 28106 Qiagen Valencia Calif. using a modified protocol to prevent excessive denaturation of the annealed DNA. To the 500 l of annealed mixture 150 l of Qiagen buffer PB was added and the mixture was split between 2 silica columns. Following a wash of each column with 750 l of Qiagen buffer PE and an extra spin to dry the columns each column was eluted with 110 l of 10 mM Tris 1 mM EDTA pH 8. The annealed and cleaned up template 220 l was then filled in by adding 1 l 100 mM ATP 10 l 25 mM dNTPs 25 mM each of dATP dCTP dGTP and dTTP 15 l 100 mM DTT 25 l 10 TM buffer 0.5 M Tris pH 7.5 0.1 M MgCl 2400 U T4 ligase and 30 U T7 polymerase for 3 h at room temperature.

The filled in product was analyzed on Tris Acetate EDTA agarose gels Sidhu et al. 328 333 363 2000 . Three bands are usually visible the bottom band is correctly filled and ligated product the middle band is filled but unligated and the top band is strand displaced. The top band is produced by an intrinsic side activity of T7 polymerase and is difficult to avoid Lechner et al. 258 11174 11184 1983 however this band transforms 30 fold less efficiently than the bottom band and usually contributes little to the library. The middle band is due to the absence of a 5 phosphate for the final ligation reaction this band transforms efficiently and gives mainly wild type sequence.

The filled in product was then cleaned up and electroporated into SS320 cells and propagated in the presence of M13 KO7 helper phage as described by Sidhu et al. 328 333 363 2000 . Library sizes ranged from 1 2 10independent clones. Random clones from the initial libraries were sequenced to assess library quality.

Phage Selection Full length human integrin alpha4beta7 was expressed in 293 cells Graham et al. 36 59 1977 purified by Fib504 affinity chromatography and used as the target for phage selection. For immobilization on MaxiSorp microtiter plates Nalge Nunc Rochester N.Y. 100 l of human integrin alpha4beta7 was coated at 5 g ml in 150 mM NaCl 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 2 mM CaCl 2 mM MgCland 2 mM MnCl TBSM overnight at 4 degrees C. Wells were blocked for 1 h using TBSM containing 1 BSA. For the first round of selection 8 wells coated with target were used a single target coated well was used for successive rounds of selection. Phage were harvested from the culture supernatant and suspended in TBSM containing 1 BSA and 0.05 TWEEN 20 TBSMBT . After binding to the wells for 2 h unbound phage were removed by extensive washing with TBS containing 0.05 TWEEN 20 TBST . Bound phage were eluted by incubating the wells with 100 mM HCl for 30 min. Phage were amplified using Top10 cells and M13 KO7 helper phage and grown overnight at 37 C. in 2YT 50 g ml carbanacillin. The titers of phage eluted from a target coated well were compared to titers of phage recovered from a non target coated well to assess enrichment. After four rounds of selection were performed random clones were selected for sequence analysis.

Fab Production and Affinity Determination To express Fab protein for affinity measurements a stop codon was introduced between the heavy chain and g3 in the phage display vector. Clones were transformed into 34B8 cells and grown in AP5 media at 30 C Presta L. et al. Cancer Res. 57 4593 4599 1997 . Cells were harvested by centrifugation suspended in 10 mM Tris 1 mM EDTA pH 8 and broken open using a microfluidizer. Fab was purified with Protein G affinity chromatography.

Affinity determinations were performed by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 3000 Biacore Piscataway N.J. . Humanized Fib504 Fab variants were immobilized in 10 mM acetate pH 4.5 ranging from 250 to 1500 response units RU on a CM5 sensor chip and 2 fold dilutions of human integrin alpha4beta7 1.5 to 770 nM in TBSM containing 2 n octylglucoside were injected. Each sample was analyzed with 5 minute association and 5 to 60 minute dissociation times. After each injection the chip was regenerated using three 1 minute injections of 8 M urea. Binding response was corrected by subtracting the RU from a blank flow cell. A 1 1 Languir model of simultaneous fitting of kand kwas used for kinetics analysis.

Humanization of rat Fib504 The human acceptor framework used for humanization is based on the framework used for HERCEPTIN and consists of the consensus human kappa I huKI VL domain and a variant of the human subgroup III humIII consensus VH domain. This variant VH domain has 3 changes from the human consensus R71A N73T and L78A. The VL and VH domains of rat Fib504 were each aligned with the human kappa I and subgroup III domains each hypervariable region HVR was identified and grafted into the human acceptor framework to generate a HVR graft 504 graft that could be displayed as an Fab on phage .

Based on the analysis of available antibody and antigen complex crystal structures MacCallum et al. MacCallum et al. 262 732 745 1996 proposed HVR definitions based on variable domain residues that frequently contact antigens. Thus positions 49G and 94M of the heavy chain were included in the HVR graft of Fib504 . In addition a second HVR graft Fib504K graft was also generated which included position 49K of the light chain because this position is also within the contact definition of HVR L2 and can serve as an antigen contact . When either the Fib504 or Fib504K grafts were displayed on phage and tested for binding to immobilized alpha4beta7 no binding was observed.

Libraries were generated using both the Fib504 and Fib504 K HVR grafts in which each of the HVR regions were soft randomized simultaneously. Each HVR graft library was panned against immobilized alpha4beta7 for 4 rounds of selection. No enrichment was observed and clones picked for DNA sequence analysis displayed only random sequence changes targeted to the 6 HVR regions.

Two additional VH framework sequences RL and RF were investigated as acceptor frameworks and contained changes at positions 71 and 78. Position 71 was changed to an Arginine as in the human subgroup III consensus and position 78 was changed to a Leucine as in the human subgroup III consensus acceptor framework RL or a Phenylalanine as in the human subgroup II consensus and the rat Fib504 VH framework acceptor framework RF . When either the Fib504 or Fib504K graft in the RL Fib504 RL and Fib504K RL or RF Fib504 RF and Fib504K RF acceptor framework was displayed on phage and tested for binding to immobilized alpha4beta7. Specific phage binding was only observed for the Fib504K graft using the RF framework . The modest binding of phage displaying the Fib504 RF graft relative to the other grafts lacking Y49K light chain and L78F heavy chain indicates the importance of these positions in selecting a useful acceptor framework.

Libraries were generated as before using a soft randomization strategy simultaneously at each of the 6 HVRs for the Fib504K RL and Fib504K RF grafts and sorted on immobilized alpha4beta7 for 4 rounds of selection as described above. Enrichment was only observed for the library based on the Fib504K RF graft. Clones from round 4 of the Fib504K RF library were selected for sequence analysis and revealed amino acid changes targeted to HVR L1. Most clones contained the change Y32L in addition position 31 was frequently changed to D S P or N . In addition to the starting graft Fib504K RF 3 clones were expressed and purified as Fab protein and further analyzed by Biacore as described above. Clones hu504 5 hu504 16 and hu504 32 variants of SEQ ID NO 1 containing substitutions T31S plus Y32L variant hu504.5 Y32L variant hu504.16 or T31D plus Y32L variant hu504.32 see showed excellent binding to alpha4beta7 relative to the Fib504K RF graft and met or exceeded the affinity of the chimeric Fib504 Fab for binding to alpha4beta7. The results of the Biacore analysis are shown in Table 3 below and indicate that selected variation in the HVRs and or framework regions disclosed herein generated antagonist antibodies to alpha4beta7 having improved affinity relative to the starting antibody. The results in Table 3 indicate that humanized variant 504.32 showed the greatest increase in affinity relative to the starting rat antibody by binding 3 fold more tightly to alpha4beta7.

The results in Table 3 also indicate that the redesign of HVR L1 was important to the restoration of high affinity antigen binding. In particular the mutation Y32L was most frequent among the various clones. Other changes at position 31 and numerous other substitutions throughout HVR H1 appear to be well tolerated and may provide additional improvement. From these results it is clear that there are multiple sequence changes that can improve the affinity of Fib504 grafted onto a human framework to generate affinities that meet or exceed that of the initial rat antibody.

Thus starting from the graft of the 6 rat Fib504 HVRs into the human acceptor scaffold the expansion of HVR L2 to include position 49 Lysine expansion of HVR H2 to include position 49 Glycine and the expansion of HVR 94 to include position 94 Methionine as well as amino acid changes at position 32 of VHR L1 where L or I replace Y and optionally at position 31 of the VHR L1 where T is replaced by D or S for example . Useful framework amino acid changes were made at positions 71 A71R and 78 L78F in the VH domain. Such amino acid changes lead to a fully human antibody variant hu504.32 for example with 3 fold improved binding affinity for alpha4beta7 integrin. Furthermore selected humanized antibodies described herein have been determined to have at least comparable biological activity as the parent rat Fib504 antibody see Example 3 herein .

The HVR amino acid sequences of humanized variant Fib504.32 were further modified to generated additional variants capable of antagonizing the activity of beta7 integrin subunit and or integrins containing the beta7 subunit.

Generating a broad amino acid scan library A library to scan selected HVR positions for other amino acid residues capable of generating beta7 binding variants of variant hu504.32 was generated using 3 oligonucleotides 504 L1 designed to soft randomize a portion of HVR L1 with a bias towards the hu504.32 HVR L1 sequence i.e. the sequence ASESVDDLLH SEQ ID NO 47 for relative positions A2 A11 was soft randomized as described above and HVR L3 504 N96 and HVR H3 504 M94 which introduce NNS at positions HVR L3 position 96 in the light chain and HVR H3 position 94 in the heavy chain thus allowing all 20 amino acids at these positions. With these three oligonucleotides the broad amino acid scan library was generated as described above using a template containing three stop codons in the light chain positions 31 and 32 in HVR L1 and position 96 in HVR L3 and 1 stop codon in the heavy chain position 94 in HVR H3 .

Broad amino acid scan of hu504 32 To more fully explore the preferred sequences allowed in HVR L1 and to enhance the stability of 504 32 we designed a phage library that a soft randomized HVR L1 of 504 32 in the region where changes were observed i.e. ASESVDDLLH SEQ ID NO 47 for relative positions A2 A11 during humanization and b allowed all possible amino acids at N96 in HVR L3 and M94 in HVR H3. Following 4 rounds of selection against immobilized full length human integrin alpha4beta7 as described above 96 random clones were selected for sequence analysis. The frequency at which amino acids were found at each position in the broad amino acid scan library suggest that the HVR L1 sequence present in hu504 32 and the methionine at position 94 in the heavy chain are optimum for high affinity binding . The most preferred amino acids obtained by the selections starting from variant 504.32 are shown in yellow. In contrast although asparagine is present at position 96 in the light chain of hu504 32 the high frequency of leucine observed at this position in the broad amino acid scan suggests the mutation N96L could further improve the affinity of humanized Fib504 variants for alpha4beta7 and also eliminate any potential deamidation problems at this position. The information in also suggests that a number of replacement amino acids are likely to be tolerated at most positions without a substantial loss in affinity. For example to eliminate oxidation of M94 in HVR H3 glutamine or arginine could likely be substituted.

Generating the limited amino acid scan libraries Six libraries for a limited amino acid scan utilized six different Kunkel templates each containing one stop codon located within one of the six HVRs. Each library was generated using a single oligonucleotide encoding a single HVR and utilizing the codons listed in codon column to alter amino acid residues for subsequent testing for binding to beta7 or alpha4beta7. The same procedures are used to alter amino acid residues of anti beta7 antibodies and test them for binding to alphaEbeta7 integrins.

Limited amino acid scan of hu504 32 The limited amino acid scan of hu504 16 was designed to make hu504 16 even more like the human light and heavy chain consensus sequence and in the process identify the minimal sequence elements of rat Fib504 that are required for binding. Six libraries were generated and targeted at each HVR at positions that differed between the hu504 16 and human consensus kappa I light or subgroup III heavy chains either the rat or human amino acid was allowed at these positions in the library . In order to accommodate coding for both amino acids during the oligonucleotide synthesis and mutagenesis additional amino acids were also introduced in some cases see encoded amino acids . The limited amino acid scan libraries were selected against immobilized full length human integrin alpha4beta7 as described above and approximately 32 random clones were sequenced from each library after round 3. The frequency of each amino acid found at each position is shown in .

Like the broad amino acid scan the limited amino acid scan also provides information about what changes are tolerated at many positions in humanized Fib504. Unlike the broad amino acid scan however the diversity allowed at each position randomized in the limited amino acid scan was restricted to a couple of amino acids. Thus the lack of any observed substitution at a given position does not indicate that a particular residue can not be changed nor does the high frequency of any particular amino acid at a given position necessarily indicate that it is the best solution for high affinity.

At some positions positions 27 29 30 53 54 of the light chain and 50 54 58 60 61 and 65 of the heavy chain the human consensus amino acid is selected quite frequently suggesting a back mutation to the human consensus would not dramatically alter binding to human alpha4beta7. In fact at position 54 of the light chain in HVR L2 the human consensus amino acid is selected more frequently than the amino acid from rat Fib504 indicating that this change made to 504 32 provides a useful beta7 binding antibody.

Further as a result of the library design amino acids that are not derived from either the human consensus or rat Fib504 are selected more frequently at some positions and provide potential substitutions to improve the affinity of humanized Fib504 variants. These include without limitation D30A and 155V in the light chain and Y50F in the heavy chain The results from these 2 libraries indicate that many HVR positions tolerate other amino acid substitutions and still retain comparable biological activity.

Summaries of observed amino acid changes are shown in . summarizes the various amino acids useful at each of the positions in the CDRs of the antibody variants of the invention at positions numbered according to Kabat numbering or a relative numbering system. Each of the additional antibodies encompassed by the variants depicted in is an embodiment of the invention.

The ability of some of the humanized Fib504 variants of the invention to bind ligands expressed on a cell surface was tested by cell adhesion assays.

Samples were applied at 0.8 mL min overnight 4 degrees C. Each column was then washed and equilibrated with 30 mL Buffer A. Elution of antibody was accomplished by chromatography at room temperature on an FPLC Amersham Pharmacia using a linear gradient of 14 min at 1 mL min from 0 to 100 Buffer B 100 mM Glycine pH 3.0 . Resulting 1 mL fractions were immediately neutralized by the addition of 75 uL 1 M tris pH 8. Eluted protein was detected by absorption at 280 nm and peak fractions were pooled and desalted into PBS on PD10 G 25 sephadex disposable sizing columns Amersham Pharmacia . Protein was detected by OD280 and peak fractions were pooled. The antibody in PBS was 0.22 um filtered and stored at 4 degrees C. Amino acid analysis was used to quantify the concentrations of these purified antibodies and values were assigned from the average of two separate determinations.

Thus a humanized anti beta7 antibody according to the invention has uses in anti beta7 integrin therapies particularly human therapies.

Different amino acid variants of the hu504.32 antibody were tested in human and mouse cell adhesion assay for their ability to inhibit beta7 containing receptor binding to its ligand according to the cell adhesion assay methods disclosed herein. The RPMI8866 MAdCAM 1 Fc assay was performed as described herein above. The alphaEbeta7 293 hu E cadherein assay was modified by the use of human E cadherin Fc as the ligand human E cadherin Fc 648 EC R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. . The relative ability of hu504.32 variants to inhibit interaction of human fibronectin huFN40 with human alpha4beta7 receptor on PRMI8866 cells was also examined. The RPMI8866 hu Fibronectin huFN40 assay used for these studies was similar in format to the RPMI8866 MAdCAM 1 Ig assay disclosed herein except that human fibronectin alpha chymotryptic fragment 40 kDa F1903 Chemicon International Temecula Calif. was used at 2 g ml to coat plates.

The ability of the hu504.32 variants to inhibit interaction of murine beta7 containing receptors with murine MAdCAM 1 or murine VCAM 1 was examined. Murine MAdCAM 1 Fc and murine VCAM 1 Fc were inhibited from interacting with murine lymphoma alpha4 cells expressing murine beta7 38C13beta7 cells by the hu504.32 variants. The murine MAdCAM 1 Fc and VCAM 1 Fc cell adhesion assays were performed similarly to those described herein above for human MAdCAM and VCAM. Where ligands were fused to Fc regions the Fc receptors on the cells were blocked with 0.5 g anti CD16 32 antibody anti Fcgamma III II receptor antibody catalog No. 553142 BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. per 1 million cells for 5 minutes at room temperature. 150 000 labeled cells in 50 l of assay medium were added to each well and incubated for 13 minutes at 37 C. The wells were washed and the amount of fluorescence released from lysed cells was measured as disclosed herein above. The control antibody for the human cell adhesion assays was the mouse monoclonal antibody to human serum albumin 6B11 Catalog No. ab10244 Novus Biologicals Littleton Colo. USA . The control antibody for the murine cell adhesion assays was the rat anti mouse integrin beta7 antibody M293 BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. which does not compete with ligand or with Fib504 for binding to integrin beta7.

The results of triplicate assays for the human and murine cell adhesion assays are provided in Tables 9 and 10 respectively.

The hu504.32 antibody has a methionine at position 94 of the heavy chain CDR3. The variants M94Q or hu504.32Q and M94R or hu504.32R have glutamine or arginine respectively at position 94 of the hu504.32 antibody variant. The hu504.32M Q and R antibodies substantially reduced integrin beta7 receptor ligand interaction in each of the assays and are thus potent inhibitors of beta7 mediated cell adhesion.

The hu504.32R antibody variant was tested in vivo for its ability to reduce integrin beta7 receptor ligand interaction and reduce lymphocyte recruitment to inflamed colon in an in vivo murine inflammatory bowel disease model. BALB c mice and CB17 SCID mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories International Inc. Wilmington Mass. USA . CD4CD45Rb high T cell reconsituted SCID colitic mice were prepared by isolating CD4CD45Rb high T cells from donor BALB c mice and transferring 3 10cells in 100 l PBS intravenously. Control SCID mice did not receive CD4CD45Rb high T cells. Reconstituted CD4 mice meeting the treatment group enrollment criteria of 10 weight loss from baseline or 15 from peak weight at week 4 were considered to have induced inflammatory bowel disease and were selected for treatment.

On the day of treatment with test antibodies donor BALB c mice mesenteric lymph node MLN cells were harvested and radiolabelled with Cr. Treatment involved prior administration of anti GP120 antibody hu504.32 anti beta7 antibody hu504.32R anti beta7 antibody or no antibody control intravenously 200 g 100 l PBS. Thirty minutes after antibody administration Cr labelled MLN cells were injected 4 10cells 100 l. One hour post injection of labelled cells mice were euthanized and spleen colon and peyers patch were collected weighed and total Crradioactivity per organ was determined. is a bar graph of the results of these tests showing the relative ability of the antibodies to block homing of radiolabelled T cells to the colon of mice experiencing inflammatory bowel disease. Homing of T cells to inflamed colon was inhibited by hu504.32 and hu504.32R anti beta7 antibodies relative to negative control anti GP120 antibody. Distribution to spleen was similar for all of the antibodies. Thus the hu504.32 and hu504.32R anti beta7 antibodies effectively inhibit homing of T cells to inflamed colon in vivo.

Antibody glycation does not affect the ability of hu504.32R variant to block MAdCAM 1 binding to alpha4beta7 receptor.

Glycation the non enzymatic glycosylation of proteins can affect antibody ligand interactions see for example Kennedy D. M. et al. Clin Exp Immunol. 98 2 245 51 1994 . Glycation of lysine at position 49 of the 504.32R Glycation of the lysine at light chain position 49 of the hu504.32R variant HVR L2 relative position B1 was observed but had no significant affect on the ability of the antibody variant to block the binding of MAdCAM 1 to alpha4beta7 receptor expressing RPMI8866 cells. Determination of glycation and glycation levels was performed using standard electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy ESI MS and by boronate affinity chromatography. Boronate affinity HPLC methods useful to test for glycation are found at for example Quan C. P. et al. Analytical Chemistry 71 20 4445 4454 1999 and Li Y. C. et al. J. Chromatography A 909 137 145 2001 . The cell adhesion assay was performed according to the RPMI8866 MAdCAM 1 Fc cell adhesion assay disclosed herein.

In alternative embodiments of the invention glycation at position 49 is reduced or eliminated where position 49 comprises an amino acid other than lysine. The polypeptide or antibody of the invention encompasses as an amino acid at position 49 HVR L2 relative position B1 any of amino acids A C D E F G H I L M N P Q R S T V W or Y where each letter refers to a amino acid according to the standard single letter amino acid designation. Alternatively the amino acid at position 49 of the light chain of a 504.32R variant or other 504 variant is selected from the group consisting of R N V A F Q H P I or L. An amino acid useful at position 49 is selected for example by displaying preparing a phage library of the hu504.32R Fab on phage variant and substituting separately at the codon for position 49 a codon for each of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Phage expressing the hu504.32R variants altered at position 49 are tested for binding to integrin beta7 and or to a receptor comprising integrin beta7 such as alpha4beta7 or alphaEbeta7 receptors. Those variants which bind to beta7 integrin or the alpha4beta7 or alphaEbeta7 receptors are further screened for the ability to inhibit integrin beta7 receptor ligand binding and in vivo efficacy as described herein. Alternative naturally or non naturally occurring amino acids may be substituted at position 49 by standard mutagenesis techniques and tested in the cell adhesion and in vivo assays described herein. Alternatively the amino acid at position 49 of the light chain is an amino acid other than lysine K and amino acids at any other HVR or framework position or positions in the light chain and or heavy chain is altered to select for a variant anti beta7 binding polypeptide or antibody that exhibits binding affinity in vitro and in vivo biological activity pharmacokinetics drug clearance and immunogenicity useful for reduction of inflammation by reducing the biological activity of integrin beta7. Mutagenesis and selection of such a polypeptide or antibody variant is performed as disclosed herein and according to other standard techniques. Such a variant anti beta7 binding polypeptide or antibody exhibits integrin beta7 binding affinity within 10 000 fold 1000 fold alternatively within 100 fold alternatively within 10 fold alternatively within 5 fold alternatively within 2 fold of the binding affinity exhibited by the any of the humanized Fib504 variants disclosed herein.
