This invention relates to digital photography and more particularly to noninvasive systems and methods for converting film cameras into digital cameras.

Film cameras have been used for many years and have been made in a variety of sizes and formats. For example typical film cameras have been available in film formats known in the industry as 35 mm 110 135 220 660 and APS. All of these typical film cameras operate by placing a film canister or cartridge within a cavity of the camera and sequentially positioning each frame of the film across an aperture in optical communication with a lens when a shutter is opened. As the pictures are taken the film is advanced by winding the film onto a take up reel. After all of the pictures have been taken the film is either rewound off the take up reel back into the film canister in the case of 35 mm film or maintained within a take up reel canister in the case of 110 220 and 660 film . The film is then removed from the camera and must be developed before the pictures are available.

Digital cameras have been developed more recently and are gaining in popularity. Digital cameras typically employ an electronic image sensing array such as a charge coupled device CCD or CMOS image sensing array which communicates with the lens of the camera. When a picture is taken the shutter of the camera opens and exposes an image sensing array to light. The image sensing array captures the image which is then retrieved from the array and stored in a memory. The camera can be coupled to a computer or printer to download the images stored in the memory for immediate on screen viewing on the computer or printing on the printer. The camera can interface with a computer or printer using a cable such as a USB cable or by using a memory device that can be removed from the camera and plugged into a corresponding slot of the computer or printer.

Many photographers are switching from film cameras to digital cameras. However these photographers often have valuable cameras lenses flashes and other accessories for their film cameras that cannot be used with their new digital cameras.

A number of attempts have been made to provide film cameras with the ability to take digital pictures. For example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 370 339 and 6 351 282 both disclose systems for converting conventional film cameras into digital cameras using an electronic apparatus that fits in the area of the camera normally occupied by film. However these prior attempts to convert film cameras into digital cameras have been met with only limited success.

The present invention seeks to provide an improved system and method for converting standard film cameras into digital cameras.

A system and method for converting a film camera into a digital camera uses an electronic device placed in a space of the camera that normally contains film. The device includes an image sensing array arranged in optical communication with a lens of the camera when a shutter is open. A read out circuit is coupled to the image sensing array and a memory is coupled to the read out circuit for storing a digital picture obtained from the image sensing array. An audio sensor is included in the electronic device to detect sounds within the camera. An acoustic pattern recognizer connected to the audio sensor determines if the detected sounds correspond with the shutter operation of the camera. The acoustic pattern recognizer has a training mode that can be used after the device is loaded into the camera to develop a set of acoustic patterns specific to the camera in which the device is loaded. The training mode uses signals received from the audio sensor and the image sensing array to determine the particular acoustic pattern that precedes the shutter opening. Once the training mode is completed the image sensing array will be switched from a low power listening mode into an image capture mode when the acoustic pattern recognizer determines that the shutter is about to be opened.

When the shutter is opened the read out circuit operates to capture multiple image frames from the image sensing array. An image processor associated with the image sensing array processes the captured images to determine when to end the image capturing process and to identify and keep only valid images captured during the shutter opening. The image processor also uses advanced image processing algorithms to obtain one or more high quality images from the multiple captured images. For example the image processor can apply a super resolution imaging algorithm to synthesize a high resolution image from a sequence of low resolution images captured during the shutter opening. The image processor can also use an image enhancement algorithm to enhance an image captured during the shutter opening. The image processor can also be used to compress and store the captured images.

According to one aspect the present invention provides a system for converting a film camera into a digital camera comprising an image sensing array a read out circuit coupled to the image sensing array a memory coupled to the read out circuit for storing a digital picture derived from an image read out from the image sensing array an audio sensor for detecting sounds within the camera and an acoustic pattern recognizer that compares signals received from the audio sensor to determine if the signals correspond with acoustic patterns associated with shutter operation the acoustic pattern recognizer having a training mode that can be used to develop a set of acoustic patterns associated with shutter operation based on signals from the audio sensor during the training mode and the image sensing array having a low power listening mode and an image capture mode and being switchable from the low power listening mode into the image capture mode when the pattern recognizer recognizes an acoustic pattern associated with shutter operation.

According to another aspect the present invention provides a system for converting a film camera into a digital camera comprising an image sensing array a read out circuit coupled to the image sensing array and a memory coupled to the read out circuit for storing a digital picture derived from an image read out from the image sensing array the read out circuit being operable to capture more than one image frame from the image sensing array during a single opening of a shutter of the film camera.

According to another aspect the present invention provides a method of taking a digital picture with a film camera comprising loading an electronic device comprising a memory unit and an image processor into a space vacated in the absence of film in the camera and placing an image sensing array in optical communication with a lens of the camera when a shutter is open detecting sounds within the camera using an audio sensor and developing a set of acoustic patterns associated with shutter operation based on signals from the audio sensor and the image sensing array during a training mode after the electronic device is loaded into the film camera.

The present invention can be embodied in various forms including business processes computer implemented methods computer program products computer systems and networks user interfaces application programming interfaces and the like.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous details are set forth such as flowcharts and system configurations in order to provide an understanding of one or more embodiments of the present invention. However it is and will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention.

A conventional camera is shown in with its back cover open. The camera has a body a lens and a shutter button . An image focal plane area is provided inside the camera where the lens produces a focused image. Various parts and details of the camera will not be described in detail herein and are well known to those skilled in the art.

An electronic device according to the present invention is also shown in and in more detail in . The electronic device is packaged in a shape and size that allow it to fit into the space of the camera normally used to hold the film canister cartridge and film. The electronic device shown in is shaped for a 35 mm camera but the electronic device can be provided in other shapes and sizes to fit into other common types of cameras such as 110 135 220 APS and so forth.

The electronic device has an image sensor array positioned on its front side at a location that corresponds with the image focal plane area of the camera when the device is loaded into the camera . The image sensor array is thus positioned at the same location that a frame of the film would normally be positioned to be exposed to an image. An audio sensor is provided for detecting camera noises during operation. The audio sensor is a sensitive microphone calibrated to pick up all noises from the camera body and operates as the noninvasive interface between the camera body and the electronic device . The device also includes a housing in which other electronic circuitry is contained as further described below.

The functional elements of the electronic device are illustrated in the block diagram of . The image sensing array is coupled to a read out circuit which in turn is coupled to an image processor . The device also includes a rechargeable power cell for supplying power to the processor and the other components and a non volatile erasable memory in which the processed images are stored. An interface is provided for transferring images from the device to an external computer or printer. For example the interface can be a USB port or a wireless interface such as a radio frequency transmitter. Alternatively the non volatile erasable memory may be a removable flash memory device including but not necessarily limited to Memory Stick as provided by Sony Corporation Tokyo Japan SD memory cards and others.

As mentioned above the electronic device includes an audio sensor for detecting the sounds of the camera during operation. The audio sensor is connected to an acoustic pattern recognizer in the electronic device . The acoustic pattern recognizer is also connected to the image processor and is operable to match the acoustic patterns received from the audio sensor with the timing of the shutter opening. As a result it is possible to develop a set of acoustic patterns that accurately predict milliseconds in advance the opening of the shutter of the camera to take a picture. This allows the electronic device to stay in a low power listening mode until just before the shutter opens to capture an image. When the acoustic pattern recognizer determines that the shutter is about to open it causes the processor to enter an image capture mode that has relatively higher power consumption. This reduces the power demand during time periods when the device is not in use and also eliminates unnecessary image capturing when the camera shutter is closed.

The electronic device includes a training mode to develop a set of acoustic patterns that match the shutter operation of the particular camera in which the device is to be used. The training mode allows the device to be easily adapted for use in almost any film camera without knowing in advance the particular acoustic pattern associated with the camera s shutter operation. Thus the electronic device does not need to be manufactured or programmed differently for each specific camera model. The training mode allows for differences between different camera models and even differences among the same camera model which might be caused by different use patterns manufacturing tolerances and so forth. By incorporating the training mode in the electronic device of the present invention it is possible to adapt the device for use with any particular camera designed to use the same size film.

The process of converting a film camera into a digital camera using the electronic device of the present invention will now be explained with reference to . In step the electronic device is loaded into the camera and then the back of the camera is closed in step . The device then automatically or manually enters the training mode in step to develop a set of acoustic patterns for the specific camera in which it is placed. In one exemplary embodiment the training mode is entered automatically each time the device is inserted in a camera e.g. using pressure switches on the device that detect the closing of the camera back .

The training mode starts in step by powering up the processor and the other circuits of the device . As indicated in step the audio sensor is used during the training mode to listen for and detect sounds within the camera . The user is instructed to press the shutter button of the camera at least once during the training mode to cause the shutter to open as if taking a picture. The shutter button can be pressed multiple times during the training mode to allow the acoustic pattern recognizer to fine tune its set of recognized acoustic patterns. The opening of the shutter and more importantly the movement of various other parts of the camera in connection with opening the shutter create a unique acoustic pattern within the camera . The acoustic pattern is detected by the audio sensor and fed to the acoustic pattern recognizer . In step data from the image sensing array or a separate light sensor is detected and then used in step to match the timing of the shutter opening with the detected acoustic pattern. The acoustic pattern and its precise timing correlated to the shutter opening the start frame the end frame the background noise level the signal to noise ratio and so forth are determined in step and then stored in the acoustic pattern recognizer in step . The training mode is then complete and the acoustic pattern recognizer will be able to accurately predict the start and end of the shutter opening for that particular camera .

The acoustic pattern recognizer can have some preloaded patterns from other cameras so that the electronic device has a model and general idea what to expect from the user s camera . The preloaded patterns will be compared with the acoustic patterns detected during the training mode to develop a more precise acoustic pattern associated with the shutter operation of the user s camera . The acoustic pattern recognizer can also be set to fine tune its recognized patterns every time the user presses the shutter button to continue to improve its recognition performance specific to the camera in which it is loaded.

After the training mode is complete or if the training mode is bypassed e.g. the shutter is not activated within a predetermined time period the device enters a low power listening mode in step . In the listening mode the audio sensor remains in a low power listening state until camera operation sounds are detected in step . When camera operation sounds are detected the acoustic pattern recognizer compares the detected acoustic pattern in step with the known acoustic pattern s stored during the training mode. If the detected acoustic pattern is not recognized the process remains in the low power listening state and continues to listen for camera operation sounds. A threshold sound level can also be used so that the circuits of the acoustic pattern recognizer are kept in a low power state until the noise within the camera exceeds a predetermined threshold at which time the circuit of the acoustic pattern recognizer wakes up to determine whether the detected acoustic pattern is recognized as a pattern associated with the shutter operation.

If the acoustic pattern recognizer determines in step that the acoustic pattern matches the known acoustic pattern of the camera just before the shutter opens then a signal is sent in step to power up the processor the image read out circuit and the image sensing array into the high power image capture mode. In step the processor controls the image read out circuit to acquire multiple image frames from the image sensing array during a single opening of the camera shutter. For example a sequence of five image frames can be captured during a single shutter opening event. The multiple image frames are then processed in step and stored in the memory of the device using advanced image processing algorithms as further explained below. By accurately predicting in advance when the shutter of the film camera will be opened the present invention allows a low power energy saving mode to be used while still ensuring that multiple images can be captured from a single shutter opening. The process continues to cycle through these steps until the memory is full or the camera back is opened to remove the device .

It should also be noted that acoustic pattern adaptation may be ongoing. For example every time an acoustic pattern is successfully recognized the existing acoustic pattern may be modified so that adaptation can take place. In this way the stored acoustic pattern and corresponding recognition can continuously improve and also evolve where acoustic changes that might occur after long periods of time e.g. due to wear and tear of shutter internal parts and the like . This adaptation may occur based upon each acoustic pattern recognition event based upon the results of several stored acoustic pattern recognition events or based upon a training review prompted at regular periods etc.

The image processor of the electronic device performs all necessary image processing functions on the sequence of images captured by the image sensing array . The image processor is programmed with motion estimation algorithms and advanced image processing algorithms to improve and enhance the quality of the images captured by the device . An exemplary set of such advanced image processing algorithms is illustrated in .

As illustrated in the image processor receives multiple image frames from the read out circuit in step . The image processor can be programmed to cause the read out circuit to end the image capturing process in step after a predetermined number of image frames are captured or once the image data indicates the shutter has closed. The image processing algorithms are then used by the image processor in step to determine which of the image frames captured for each shutter opening event are similar valid and to reject the rest as being either too early or too late relative to the shutter opening typically none of the frames will be identical because of the camera movement or the movement of the subject .

The image processor then applies a super resolution imaging algorithm in step to synthesize a high resolution image from a sequence of low resolution images captured during the shutter opening. For example the electronic device might use a 1 Megapixel camera sensor but because of the super resolution imaging it will produce a 5 Megapixel image from a sequence of lower resolution images. Conventional super resolution processing techniques may be implemented by the image processor to accommodate this functionality. The image processor accesses a set of images corresponding to the same image capture session and performs any aliasing and pixel shifting to accommodate merging of the images to the high resolution image. If desired where motion estimation functionality is incorporated the determination of motion may be correlated to the capture of images and that information is incorporated into the super resolution imaging algorithm in order to accommodate for motion that may have occurred during image capture.

In addition to or instead of the super resolution imaging algorithm the image processor also includes an image enhancement algorithm as depicted in step . The image enhancement algorithm can be used to enhance a relatively low quality image for better resolution and picture quality. Various image enhancement algorithms may be implemented including but not limited to those that implement edge detection and processing shape recognition contrast factors color factors and others.

Once the advanced image processing algorithms complete their image processing in steps then the processed image is compressed and stored in the memory of the electronic device in step . The images stored in the memory can be transferred to an external computer using suitable peripherals such as a communication port e.g. USB port on the electronic device a radio frequency communication device or other known data transfer techniques and devices.

The electronic device of the present invention is camera independent and can be manufactured in the form factor of all popular film formats and cameras. Since the device develops its own set of recognized acoustic patterns in whatever camera it is placed its correlation between the camera s shutter operation and the image capturing mode is highly accurate and readily adaptable to any camera in which the device is loaded.

When the memory is full or the battery is low the device can be equipped to emit audible warnings to the user. In another embodiment warning and status messages can be displayed on a wireless control panel affixed to the outside of the camera body .

The system and method according to the present invention provide a non invasive way of transitioning from film to digital photography while keeping and using existing photographic gear. The transition using the present invention is simple and does not risk damage to the film camera in case the user desires to convert the camera back to film use. The user does not need to learn any complicated procedures for using a new digital camera. The technique is non invasive so no modifications to the existing film camera are needed. The cost of making the conversion is low because all existing photography gear can be reused. The existing camera can continue to be used for exposure and focus control in a normal manner.
