title: Micromagnetic elements, logic devices and related methods
abstract: Micromagnetic elements, logic devices and methods of fabricating and using them to store data and perform logic operations are disclosed. Micromagnetic elements for data storage, as well as those providing output from a logic device, are at least partially covered with an optical coating that facilitates determination of the magnetic state. The disclosed logic devices perform one or more of AND, OR, NAND and NOR operations.
