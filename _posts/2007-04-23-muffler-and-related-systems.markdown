abstract: Mufflers are provided for a vehicle exhaust system having a combustion chamber and an exhaust pipe. The vehicle exhaust system is configured to reduce the noise of combustion gasses generated in the combustion chamber. An exemplary muffler includes a proximal end and a distal end, the proximal end being configured for mounting the muffler to the exhaust pipe leading to the engine, the distal end being configured to allow the combustion gasses to pass therethrough, and at least one vortex chamber disposed between the proximal end and the distal end. The at least one vortex chamber includes a circular peripheral wall for inducing a vortex on a portion of the combustion gasses expelled from the combustion chamber during high-pressure pulsations created by the operation of a vehicle engine. The vortex impedes flow of the combustion gasses from the pipe such that acoustic energy associated with the expulsion of the combustion gasses is dissipated.

This patent application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 009 855 filed on 10 Dec. 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 207 258 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present disclosure generally relates to mufflers and vehicle exhaust systems for quieting combustion chamber noise.

Many known combustion engines utilize expanding high pressure combustion gasses to move a piston. Ignition of the fuel creates high pressure pulses of combustion gasses that exit the engine manifold and travel down pipes to a muffler that helps reduce the noise from the engine. When the combustion gasses also referred to herein as the exhaust gasses or exhaust gas exit the tailpipe of a vehicle engine noises are heard. The rapid pressurization and subsequent depressurization of the exhaust system caused by the high pressure pulses create a loud sound. As would be expected the louder the noise the more significant the annoyance factor and more potential damage to hearing.

The use of mufflers with combustion engines to reduce the amplitude of the acoustic energy of the exhausting gas is known. A typical muffler is located along an exhaust pipe and provides a large expansion volume compared to the pipe. With the muffler in place the pressurized combustion gasses have a relatively large volume into which to expand. As the combustion gasses expand into the volume of the muffler the pressure of those gasses falls significantly. Therefore as the exhausting gas finally exits the muffler the pressure of the combustion gasses being released to the atmosphere is significantly lower than the pressure of the combustion gasses when a muffler is not used. By reducing the peak amplitude of the combustion gas pressure released to the atmosphere the sound of the vehicle exhaust system is much softer.

Many existing mufflers are typically of complex construction. For example many mufflers have small orifices or diffusion materials that may become fouled by residue deposited as combustion gasses pass through the muffler. Fouling of these parts and variances during the life of the vehicle exhaust system may cause reduced efficiency and or total inoperability of the muffler. Many existing mufflers also require the use of baffling materials for the reduction of the exhaust noise.

Briefly described devices and systems involving a muffler for use with a vehicle exhaust system are disclosed. A representative embodiment of a muffler is provided for a vehicle exhaust system that has a combustion chamber and an exhaust pipe that the exhaust gas travels through before passing through the said muffler. The vehicle exhaust system is configured to emit exhausting gasses with minimal backpressure. The muffler also includes a proximal end and a distal end the proximal end being configured for mounting the muffler to the pipe leading to the engine the distal end being configured to allow the exhausting gasses to pass therethrough to vent into the atmosphere. The muffler includes at least one vortex chamber disposed between the proximal end and the distal end the at least one vortex chamber including a circular peripheral wall for inducing a vortex on a portion of the combustion gasses during passage through the system.

The vehicle exhaust system includes a combustion chamber an exhaust pipe for guiding the exhausting gasses along an exhaust gas path and a muffler. The muffler includes a proximal end and a distal end the proximal end being configured for mounting the muffler to the pipe the distal end being configured to allow the exhausting gasses to pass therethrough and at least one vortex chamber disposed between the proximal end and the distal end. The at least one vortex chamber includes a circular peripheral wall for inducing a vortex on a portion of the combustion gasses during emission.

Other systems methods features and or advantages will be or may become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems methods features and or advantages be included within this description and be protected by the accompanying claims.

Embodiments of mufflers for reducing the amplitude of engine noise transmitted to the atmosphere of a vehicle exhaust system are discussed. depicts an exemplary embodiment of a muffler as would be disposed on a vehicle exhaust system. and depict an exemplary embodiment of a muffler of the disclosure. The principles of operation of an embodiment of a vortex diode are depicted in . The remaining figures depict other exemplary embodiments of mufflers.

Referring now to an embodiment of a vehicle exhaust system is depicted including an embodiment of a muffler . Specifically the muffler is attached to the exhaust pipe of the vehicle exhaust system . Although the vehicle exhaust system is attached to a vehicle embodiments of mufflers may be used with other types of high pressure systems such as pressurized tools and industrial equipment.

Preferably the muffler includes a plurality of vortex diodes disposed on the inner cylindrical wall . Each vortex diode includes a circular peripheral wall defining a substantially cylindrical vortex chamber a vent and a nozzle formed in the circular peripheral wall . Many mufflers require multiple passes within the total enclosure to improve noise abatement. While show an exemplary straight line flow the multiple vortex diode concepts could be applied along more complex flow patterns. While a plurality of 180 degree pipe bends with added straight sections would increase the total path length within the muffler bends of this magnitude would greatly increase the backpressure and it is important not to increase the backpressure on the engine such that it unnecessarily impedes engine performance therefore such complex flow patterns must take into account the degree to which they increase backpressure.

As shown in the circular peripheral wall is disposed about the vent and the nozzle is formed tangential to the circular peripheral wall . Embodiments are envisioned wherein multiple nozzles are positioned at various points around the circular peripheral wall each providing a tangential input to the chamber. As such combustion gasses flowing in the direction of the flow arrows enter the vortex diode through the vent and pass through the vortex chamber directly out the nozzle . Fluid flow in this direction is restricted only by the cross sections of the vent and nozzle .

In contrast combustion gasses flowing in the direction of the flow arrows shown in first pass through the nozzle thereby entering the vortex chamber tangentially to the circular peripheral wall . As such the fluid is forced to spiral creating a vortex prior to exiting through the vent . As is evident from the circular shape of the vortex chamber provides an angular acceleration to the tangentially flowing fluid. The resultant angular velocity of the fluid causes the formation of the vortex within the vortex chamber thereby restricting the exit flow of the fluid through the vent .

As shown in one or more vortex diodes are disposed within the muffler such that the vortex chamber is in fluid communication with the exhausting gas path by way of the vent and the expansion chamber by way of the nozzle . Therefore during the expulsion of combustion gasses from a vehicle exhaust system the gasses will be allowed to freely expand into the expansion chamber by flowing through the vent through the vortex chamber and out the nozzle as previously discussed with regard to . For example as shown in as the combustion gasses are urged along the exhausting gas path by expansion and the continuous introduction into the vehicle exhaust system of additional combustion gasses as each succeeding cycle of combustion is completed in the vehicle engine the combustion gasses will eventually reach a location within the muffler where they are allowed to pass through the vortex diodes with minimal resistance and into the expansion chamber

To facilitate the flow of gasses into the expansion chamber a pressure bleed port or ports not shown can be positioned toward the distal end thereby removing any block loaded pressure condition and reducing the input impedance of gasses into the chamber . An exemplary port could be a simple hole or could also be a vortex diode that will change resistance significantly when the chamber begins to become pressurized. Another possible location for such a pressure bleed port could be between adjacent chambers should there be more than one with the fluid communication path eventually leading to the discharge part .

Once the combustion gasses have passed into the expansion chamber the pressures within the vehicle exhaust system and the muffler represented by P P P and P are substantially equal and greater than the ambient pressure represented by P. Note however although greater than ambient pressure P those pressures represented by P through P are substantially less than the pressure exhibited by combustion gasses leaving exhaust pipe of vehicle exhaust system when the muffler is not used.

As shown in as the combustion gasses leave muffler and the pressures P and P approach ambient pressure P pressures P and P are now greater than pressures P and P. As such the higher pressure combustion gasses present in the expansion chamber will flow to the lower pressure region represented by pressures P and P by flowing through the vortex diodes . Each vortex diode now slows the depressurization of the expansion chamber by inducing a vortex represented by flow arrows on the combustion gasses as they flow first through the nozzle tangentially about the vortex chamber and eventually to the atmosphere through the vent and then the discharge opening . As such each vortex diode not only aids in reducing the peak pressure of the combustion gasses released to atmosphere but also delays the depressurization of the expansion chamber thereby reducing the pressure variation at the distal end of the muffler due to the fuel combustion cycle discharging combustion gasses into vehicle exhaust system . Additional versions of vortex diodes and chamber combinations can be placed within the same muffler for successive pressure drops.

As shown the first vortex diode includes a vortex chamber formed by the second wall a first partition and a circular peripheral wall . The circular peripheral wall is preferably the inner surface of the outer housing . The first vortex diode also includes a nozzle configured to introduce combustion gasses tangentially to the circular peripheral wall and a vent the function of which is performed by the discharge opening of the second wall . Similarly the second vortex diode is formed between the first partition and a second partition and includes a circular peripheral wall and a nozzle for introducing combustion gasses tangential to the circular peripheral wall . Note the dimensions of the various vortex chambers do not need to be uniform with respect to other vortex chambers within the same muffler.

A first exhausting gas aperture formed in the first partition functions as the vent for the second vortex diode . A third vortex diode is similarly formed between a third partition and the second partition . The first exhausting gas aperture the second exhausting gas aperture and a third exhausting gas aperture formed in the third partition are all disposed along and about the exhausting gas path .

As shown the proximal end of the muffler includes an expansion chamber formed between the third partition the first wall and a portion of the outer housing . As shown the expansion chamber is a cylindrical volume although this is not necessary for all embodiments. Preferably a first fluid conduit extends from an inlet in the outer wall of the expansion chamber to the nozzle of the first vortex diode . Note the first fluid conduit does not need to be outside the muffler as shown. Rather the fluid conduit could be fashioned to conduct flows internal to the outer housing in voids created by walls not shown . Similarly a second conduit extends from an inlet formed in the outer wall of the expansion chamber to the nozzle of the second vortex diode . The first and second conduits allow combustion gasses as indicated by the flow arrows to flow from the expansion chamber to their respective vortex diodes 

When the vehicle engine is running the exhausting gas not shown will eventually reach the vicinity of the third exhausting gas aperture . At this point the combustion gasses that have been propelled out of exhaust pipe pass into the expansion chamber where at least a portion of the combustion gasses exit through first and second inlets and travel down the first and second conduits into the first and second vortex diodes respectively. The combustion gasses that reach the first vortex diode are introduced to the vortex chamber tangentially to the circular peripheral wall . As such a first vortex is induced thereby delaying the escape of the combustion gasses from the muffler by way of the discharge opening . Similarly the combustion gasses that reach the second vortex chamber are introduced tangentially to the circular peripheral wall through nozzle thereby forming a second vortex . Thus the escape of the combustion gasses through the first exhausting gas aperture and ultimately to the atmosphere is delayed. Note embodiments of the muffler are envisioned wherein the conduits pass through the various partitions to their respective vortex diodes rather than being external to the outer housing . Additional internal helical baffles not shown can optionally be added to the proximal and distal ends of each vortex chamber to initiate swirl to the expanding gasses prior to any additional circulation being induced by the nozzles. These baffles could be configured similar to turbine blade shapes that redirect the expanding fluids in the same direction of the induced swirl of the vortex diode.

Another embodiment of a muffler is depicted in . As shown the muffler includes a proximal end and a distal end the proximal end being formed by a first wall including an entry opening and the distal end being formed by a second wall including a discharge opening . A cylindrical outer housing extends from the first wall to the second wall thereby forming a cylindrical expansion chamber. The entry opening the discharge opening and the outer housing are disposed about the exhausting gas path . As shown the muffler also includes a helically shaped baffle extending from the proximal end for a portion of the length of the muffler . The helically shaped baffle contacts the first wall . However the helically shaped baffle can be spaced from the first wall in other embodiments.

The muffler functions under the vortex diode flow principles previously described to reduce the amplitude of the sound of engine combustion in a vehicle exhaust system. In the embodiment shown a vortex diode includes a vortex chamber formed by the cylindrical volume of the muffler a circular peripheral wall formed by the inner surface of the outer housing and a vent as formed by the discharge opening . The function of a nozzle is performed by the helically shaped baffle . As an exhausting gas exits the pipe of the vehicle exhaust system the combustion gasses enter the vortex chamber of the vortex diode where they encounter the helically shaped baffle . Preferably the helically shaped baffle includes an outer edge that is in contact with the circular peripheral wall and an inner edge which is adjacent the exhausting gas path .

Preferably the inner edge has an edge extension that extends slightly in the direction toward the proximal end whereby the edge extension helps capture the expanding gasses and force containment and circulation outward along the helical baffle . As the combustion gasses encounter the helically shaped baffle an angular acceleration is imparted on the combustion gasses causing the gasses to flow outwardly toward the circular peripheral wall . As such as the combustion gasses travel the length of the vortex chamber a vortex is induced as shown by the flow arrows. Therefore the helically shaped baffle has performed the function of a nozzle by inducing a vortex on the combustion gasses. Similar to the prior discussions the induced vortex will contain the gasses within the chamber due to outwardly expanding circular swirl and delay the escape of the expanding combustion gasses to atmosphere thereby reducing the sound of engine combustion.

Preferably an inner cylindrical wall of the first stage extends from the entry opening to a third exhausting gas aperture formed in a third partition of the second stage . An outer housing is disposed about the inner cylindrical wall thereby forming an expansion chamber

Preferably the first stage includes a plurality of vortex diodes disposed on the inner cylindrical wall . Each vortex diode includes a circular peripheral wall defining a substantially cylindrical vortex chamber a vent and a nozzle formed in the circular peripheral wall . Embodiments are envisioned wherein multiple nozzles are positioned at various points around the circular peripheral wall each providing a tangential input to the chamber.

Preferably one or more vortex diodes are disposed within the first stage such that the vortex chamber is in fluid communication with the exhausting gas path by way of the vent and the expansion chamber by way of the nozzle . Therefore during the high pressure pulsations passing through the vehicle exhaust system combustion gasses will be allowed to freely expand into the expansion chamber by flowing through the vent through the vortex chamber and out the nozzle as previously discussed with regard to . As the exhausting gas is urged along the exhausting gas path by expansion and the continuous introduction into the vehicle exhaust system of additional combustion gasses as each succeeding cycle is completed in the vehicle engine the combustion gasses will eventually reach a point within the first stage where they are allowed to pass through the vortex diodes with minimal resistance and into the expansion chamber

Preferably the second stage of the muffler includes a cylindrical outer housing extending from the third partition to the second wall a first axially disposed vortex diode a second axially disposed vortex diode and a third axially disposed vortex diode . Note embodiments of the muffler are envisioned that include as few as one axially disposed vortex diode as well as numbers of vortex axially disposed diodes greater than that shown. For ease of description only the operation of first axially disposed vortex diode and second vortex diode will be discussed.

As shown the first axially disposed vortex diode includes a vortex chamber formed by the second wall a first partition and a circular peripheral wall . Preferably the circular peripheral wall is the inner surface of the outer housing . The first vortex diode also includes at least one nozzle configured to introduce combustion gasses tangentially to the circular peripheral wall and a vent the function of which is performed by the discharge opening of the second wall . Similarly the second vortex diode is formed between the first partition and a second partition and includes a circular peripheral wall and at least one nozzle for introducing combustion gasses tangential to the circular peripheral wall . Note the dimensions of the various vortex chambers do not need to be uniform with respect to other vortex chambers within the same muffler.

A first exhausting gas aperture formed in the first partition functions as the vent for the second vortex diode . A third vortex diode is similarly formed between a third partition and the second partition . The first exhausting gas aperture the second exhausting gas aperture and a third exhausting gas aperture formed in the third partition are all disposed along and about the exhausting gas path . The inside diameters of exhausting gas apertures and will ensure the exhausting gas travels through the apertures without excess restriction but with minimal dimension to improve the effectiveness of the muffler . By way of an example the inner diameters of apertures and can be equivalent to the inner diameter of distal end .

Control ports bleed a portion of high pressure air from the expansion chamber to a volume formed between the outer housing and a second housing . As indicated by the flow arrows combustion gasses are allowed to flow from the expansion chamber to the axially disposed vortex diodes by way of the volume and the nozzles 

The pulsating high pressure combustion gasses that reach the first vortex diode are introduced to the vortex chamber tangentially to the circular peripheral wall . As discussed in regard to a first vortex is induced thereby delaying the escape of the combustion gasses from the muffler by way of the discharge opening . Similarly the combustion gasses that reach the second vortex chamber are introduced tangentially to the circular peripheral wall through nozzle thereby forming a second vortex . The escape of the combustion gasses through the first exhausting gas aperture and ultimately to the atmosphere is delayed.

As the combustion gasses leave the muffler the higher pressure combustion gasses remaining in the expansion chamber will flow to the lower pressure region along the flight path by flowing through the vortex diodes of the first stage . Each vortex diode now slows the depressurization of the expansion chamber by inducing a vortex represented by flow arrows on the combustion gasses as they flow first through the nozzle tangentially about the vortex chamber and eventually to the atmosphere through the vent and then the discharge opening . As such each vortex diode not only aids in reducing the peak pressure of the combustion gasses released to atmosphere but also delays the depressurization of the expansion chamber thereby reducing the pressure variation at the distal end of the muffler due to the fuel combustion cycle discharging combustion gasses into vehicle exhaust system .

It should be recognized a muffler can incorporate a plurality of mufflers arranged in both series and parallel within one housing increasing the effectiveness of the noise abatement.

Note although the mufflers that have been disclosed are for use in reducing the noise of a vehicle exhaust system similar devices operating on similar principles can be used to quiet exhausting of high pressure fluids gasses liquids gas liquid combinations etc. in industrial equipment generators and other manufacturing equipment to include high pressure fluids containing particulate matter in suspension or solution.
