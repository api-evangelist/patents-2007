This invention was made with Government support by the U.S. Air Force under contract FA9451 04 D 0412 0002. The government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to lasers and more particularly to optically pumped semiconductor lasers and methods for designing lasers that have intrinsic heat induced self lensing such that a compensating lensing is added to obtain good beam quality and in particular methods and apparatus to maintain a degree of resonator instability under large heat loads that would otherwise produce self lensing stability leading to poor beam quality.

Although the following detailed description contains many specifics for the purpose of illustration a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly the following preferred embodiments of the invention are set forth without any loss of generality to and without imposing limitations upon the claimed invention.

In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The leading digit s of reference numbers appearing in the Figures generally corresponds to the Figure number in which that component is first introduced such that the same reference number is used throughout to refer to an identical component which appears in multiple Figures. Signals and connections may be referred to by the same reference number or label and the actual meaning will be clear from its use in the context of the description.

A number of embodiments of the present invention embody and describe the laser as an optically pumped semiconductor laser OPSL . For each such described embodiment the present invention includes other embodiments wherein the laser gain medium is solid state but not semiconductor or wherein the laser gain medium is electrically pumped and forms an electrically pumped semiconductor laser but wherein the thermal lensing and the compensation for thermal lensing e.g. iteratively changing the width of the pump stripe are modeled and or iteratively determined in a manner similar to the described embodiments.

A number of other embodiments of the present invention embody and describe the laser as an optically pumped solid state laser OPSSL which is a generic term that includes both optically pumped semiconductor lasers OPSLs and other embodiments wherein the laser gain medium is solid state but not semiconductor. For each such described embodiment the present invention includes other embodiments wherein the laser is an optically pumped semiconductor laser OPSL or wherein the laser is an electrically pumped semiconductor laser EPSL but wherein the thermal lensing and the compensation for thermal lensing are modeled and or iteratively determined in a manner similar to the described embodiments.

As used herein an unstable resonator and lasing instability refer to classical unstable resonators that do not form stable single or multiple mode lasing operation. In stable resonators eigenmodes exist which do not change as the radiation makes round trips through the cavity while such eigenmodes do not exist for unstable resonators. In unstable resonators there are no ray paths which will not eventually walk out of the cavity. Because of the instability when lasing is established the beam from an unstable resonator will more likely be a low divergence high quality beam than the beam from a multimode stable resonator.

In one preferred embodiment system is located inside a vacuum dewar to minimize heat transfer from the outside environment to the system. In some embodiments system is affixed e.g. soldered into a temperature controlled enclosure sometimes called an oven although some embodiments use only a controlled cooler e.g. some embodiments are operated close to liquid nitrogen temperatures i.e. around 77 K whose internal temperature and temperature profile i.e. the absolute temperature and the temperature differentials are tightly controlled e.g. by a controller that monitors one or more temperatures in the temperature controlled enclosure and controls the amounts and or locations of heating and or cooling that are applied in order to maintain more constant lasing wavelength and output power and to reduce mode hopping. In some embodiments a plurality of temperature sensors monitor temperatures and various locations within the temperature controlled enclosure of system and feed temperature signals to controller which in turn controls a plurality of cooling and or heating elements e.g. Stirling cycle coolers Peltier effect heater coolers and or the like in order to maintain a tightly controlled profile of absolute temperatures and or temperature differentials.

In some embodiments the mask heatsink portions and form a slit between them that defines where the light goes called the pump stripe herein onto and into the lasing medium and thus the thermal profile that causes the thermal lensing. The thermal lensing is a cause of the laser establishing lasing stability. One purpose of the present invention is to change the width of the pump stripe and or the curvature of one or more of the feedback mirrors on the end s of the lasing medium in order to compensate for the thermal lensing and thus establish good beam quality and single mode lasing e.g. by maintaining lasing instability through thermal lensing compensation .

According to an embodiment by Ron Kaspi the present invention is modified such that rather than using a constant width pump stripe having parallel edges along the length of the signal path in the gain medium as described for the other embodiments of the invention the width of the slit and or pump stripe varies along its length in a manner that is iteratively derived by modeling and testing prototype laser devices. For example in some such embodiments one could taper the stripe such that as measured in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the laser beam the middle of the stripe is made wider than the ends and the amount or rate of widening is iteratively increased until a desired amount of instability is achieved. In other such embodiments one could taper the stripe such that as measured in the direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the laser beam the middle of the stripe is made narrower than the ends and the amount of narrowing is iteratively changed until a desired amount of instability is achieved. In still other such embodiments one could taper the stripe such that as measured in the direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the laser beam one end of the stripe is made narrower than the other end and the amount of narrowing is iteratively changed until a desired amount of instability is achieved. The approaches disclosed here can still be used to guide the design even for these cases with non rectangular pump stripes for instance tapered or hour glass shaped pump stripes. In these cases an average stripe width averaged over the length of the pumped region can be calculated and used in the formulas of the present invention where the width of the pump stripe is called for.

In some embodiments the tops of mask portions and are coated with a multi layer dielectric mirror in order to minimize heat absorption in those portions on the gain medium that prevent pump light from entering the gain medium towards the outer edges. In some embodiments the modeling includes the temperature effect of the light that strikes the mask on the gain medium and is absorbed there such that the thermal profile prediction from the model includes the effect of light being partially absorbed by the mask and in some embodiments the absorptive qualities of the mask are adjusted up or down to achieve a particular profile. In some embodiments the active gain region e.g. a multiple quantum well MQW layered structure is located towards the bottom heatsink so it can be more effectively cooled by conduction to the heatsink since then the heat dissipated from structure does not have to pass through the somewhat thermally resistive material . This is commonly referred to as an epi down configuration. In some embodiments a plurality of temperature sensors e.g. thermistors are embedded e.g. in holes in a Cartesian grid pattern within heatsink in order to closely monitor the temperature profile of the OPSL gain medium in the epi down configuration locating temperature sensors in heatsink can also be used to monitor the temperature profile of the OPSL gain medium in the epi up configuration shown in but may have a slower response time due to the lag in heat flow through that gain medium . In some embodiments the devices of the present invention are cooled to the maximum extent practible e.g. by liquid nitrogen in some embodiments .

In some embodiments the stripe width is primarily or even entirely established by focussing optics and or one or more apertures in the pump light path between the pump source and the OPSL and the mask sections and are omitted or play a secondary role in establishing the stripe width. In some such embodiments the stripe width is varied dynamically and or iteratively using the focussing optics between the pump source and the OPSL. In some embodiments controller dynamically controls the focussing and or aperture size based on monitoring signals from temperature sensors and or beam quality sensors.

Some embodiments of this method of the present invention use only focussing elements and allow more of the pump light to be used since rather than using a mask on the OPSL chip or an aperture between the pump source and the OPSL both of which block or reflect pump light to establish the stripe width and thus waste the light that falls outside of the desired stripe the method uses focussing optics e.g. a cylindrical lens to establish the stripe width. In some such embodiments and the width of the stripe is iteratively changed by moving the position s of the pump source the OPSL chip and or the focussing optics until a desired amount of instability and thus a good beam quality is achieved. In some such embodiments a constant width stripe is established and its width then iteratively changed by the focussing optics while in other embodiments different shapes e.g. tapered or bow tie shapes for the pump stripe are formed by the focussing optics.

A thermal gradient in the transverse temperature profile of a solid state gain medium e.g. one used for a laser sets up a gradient in the transverse index of refraction profile a thermal lens or duct . The strength of this lens depends only on the variation in the temperature T across the transverse direction but generally not the overall background temperature.

Analysis of Gaussian and parabolic profile ducts is a standard technique found for instance in Anthony E. Siegman s University Science Books Sausalito Calif. 1986. In a Fabry Perot cavity where the wavefronts are flat there is a simple formula for the size of the fundamental mode. Beam quality can be estimated by the number of times the fundamental mode fits in the emitting aperture or

In some embodiments the two main strategies for improving beam quality are to decrease the pump stripe width a and or to decrease the thermal gradient T. The thermal gradient is affected by many factors including pump power pump pulse duration pump stripe width chip length the material s conducting heat away from the immediate area of the pumped region transverse pump profile and the thermal efficiency of the OPSL. In some embodiments the curvature of the thermal profile depends upon the characteristics of all of the material through which heat flows from the rather tiny gain region and or the regions onto which pump light is projected. So in some embodiments one uses different material thermal constants for the epi up versus epi down configurations. In the end for the Fabry Perot cavity the best improvement to beam quality comes from using a narrower pump stripe. Although the narrower pump stripe increases the thermal gradient T it is more than compensated by the decrease in a. Unfortunately decreasing a causes the overall device temperature to rise which leads to a decrease in optical efficiency. So the narrower pump stripe is useful in terms of improving beam quality but degrades overall system performance. T is smaller for the wider pump stripe but the increase in the effective resonator aperture size a allows more transverse lasing modes to fit in the cavity resulting in poorer beam quality.

From the formulas for Min the Fabry Perot we can see that there is no sharp break where a small change in stripe width makes a substantial change in beam quality. This is not the case for an unstable resonator.

In some embodiments using analysis for a parabolic thermal profile we calculate the effective focal length of the thermal lens as a function of the thermal gradient. The effective focal power of the thermal lens is markedly stronger in the narrower pump stripe.

In the curved flat faced cavity the pump stripe width also affects whether the cavity operates as a classical unstable resonator. The geometry is such that for a wider stripe the effective focal length is longer and the cavity also has a larger range of potential operation as a classical unstable resonator as shown in .

In the region above the curve the cavity will operate as a stable resonator. For the narrower pump stripe there is a much smaller range of thermal gradients in which the cavity will operate as a classical unstable resonator. The narrower pump stripe also leads to higher transverse thermal gradients making it difficult to achieve unstable operation with the narrower pump stripe.

A specific prescription exists for the minimum pump stripe required for unstable operation based on the stripe geometry and thermal gradient T. The cavity will operate as a classical unstable resonator as long as 

In the following discussion is a short derivation of a rule for designing Optically Pumped Semiconductor Lasers OPSLs with unstable resonators such that they will produce a high beam quality a beam having low M .

In earlier work at low to moderate operating power in devices with flat flat stable resonators it was found that the best beam quality was achieved by making the width of the excited stripe on the semiconductor material as narrow as practical. The thermal gradients produced by the pumping produce a positive thermal lens making the flat flat resonator stable. The narrow pump stripe produced the best beam quality because the number of modes in the resonator scales as the area of the gain region so to limit the number of higher order modes smaller pumped regions are favored. Still as pump power was increased the beam quality degraded rapidly.

To solve the beam quality at high power the approach of using an unstable resonator was attempted. Unstable resonators are well known solutions to produce good beam quality in many types of high power lasers including solid state lasers. The unstable resonator is produced by replacing the flat high reflecting surface at the back of the laser cavity the back surface of the semiconductor laser chip with a curved external reflective surface its convex side toward the gain material or a mirrored facet formed in the gain material and having a concave surface . But it was discovered that although the unstable resonator produced good beam quality at low to moderate powers at high pump power the beam quality degraded nevertheless. Attempts to improve the beam quality by using a narrower pump stripe were fruitless. Experts in the physics of optical semiconductor devices conjectured that the degraded beam quality was due to filamentation and other nonlinear and chaotic effects in the semiconductor material and could not readily be compensated for.

The inventors of the present invention developed a thermo optical model that explains the observations and can be used as a design rule for improving beam quality at high powers in these types of OPSLs. At high pump powers a very strong thermal lens is created in the lasing semiconductor material. This thermal lens can become so strong that the positive thermal lens overwhelms the negative curvature of the back mirror in the laser cavity and the resonator becomes stable. The stable resonator then supports many transverse modes leading to poor beam quality. The key is to keep the positive optical power of the thermal lens from overwhelming the negative power of the end mirror in the cavity so the resonator remains unstable. The strength of the thermal lens depends on the pumping conditions and the material thermal characteristics so it is possible to define a quantitative design rule that will lead to a high beam quality high power OPSL.

Below is a derivation that shows the relationship of the various factors that determine the stability of the cavity and therefore the limitations that will give good or bad beam quality. Briefly the mathematical relation is based upon knowing the shape of the thermal distribution obtained for an infinitesimally narrow heated stripe on the surface of the material. This can be written analytically. Then if one multiplies that function by the shape of the pumping distribution and integrates over the width of the distribution one can get the figure for T across the beam. In some embodiments the function is the Green s function for the problem one takes the Green s function that describes what temperature distribution is obtained for an infinitesimally narrow line source of heat and convolves and or integrates it with the actual heating distribution.

The following provides a heuristic method for choosing stripe width pump power and the like where the simplifying assumption of uniform pumping across the stripe width is made note that the term convex mirror is convex from the viewpoint of the resonator beam reflected from the mirror such that when an external mirror is used that mirror has a convex shape but when the mirror is formed directly on an end facet of the semiconductor chip that facet is concave when viewed from outside the chip but is still convex from the viewpoint of the beam 

Thermal Properties of the material conducting heat away from the immediate area of the pumped region considered primarily or only heatsink material for epi down or primarily or only OPSL gain medium material for epi up thermal conductivity in units of power units of length temperature 

In some other embodiments a simplified method is used wherein for the present invention s regions of interest this is basically the same as satisfying the equation 

Now for this simplified method one just needs to estimate T in terms of a P L and other material properties. The flux on the surface is proportional to 

In some embodiments a Fabry Perot analysis motivates why one would look at thermal lensing in the unstable resonator. In some embodiments the formula for Min terms of a and T is used to design a pumping scheme. Since that approach would lead to a narrower stripe and consequently a higher overall device temperature this leads to many trade offs in terms of efficiency but is useful for lasers built using highly efficient semiconductors and very powerful cryostats.

In some embodiments the OPSL design invention includes providing a curved facet on at least one end of the OPSL for better beam quality wherein the curvature of the facet is designed by modeling and meeting the equations above. In some embodiments improved beam quality is achieved in the OPSL by squaring the cross sectional shape of pump intensity. In some embodiments the present invention provides a method that achieves near diffraction limited beam quality and optimizes brightness in high power flat and or curved facet OPSLs by choosing pump stripe width and shape the laser s pump duration and or OPSL length. In some embodiments the parameter space is used where the high brightness is achieved pump power 20 to 100 W pump width 80 m to 100 mm OPSL length 2 6 mm. In some such embodiments 80 m is too narrow for good beam quality with curved facet resonator and other optical effects are used to obtain beam quality.
