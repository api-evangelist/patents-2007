For example distributors include third party operators of news web sites.

The e mail message invites the contributor to join a BlogBurst community which is managed by the BlogBurst server. Such community receives benefits of various services that are provided by the BlogBurst server as described further hereinbelow. The e mail message invites the contributor to click a customized link that contains a system generated unique identification ID invitation code as shown in . In response to the contributor clicking such link which requests a web page from the BlogBurst server the BlogBurst server via such web page prompts the contributor via a web browsing program that is executed by the contributor s IHS to voluntarily provide account registration information to the BlogBurst server via the network as shown in in order to join the BlogBurst community. In this manner various contributors enter account settings and user information to describe themselves.

As shown in a contributor a provides account setup and login information and b accepts and agrees to an end user license agreement EULA between such contributor and the BlogBurst server s governing organization. The EULA specifies various obligations access rights distribution rights and other rights that are automatically under the EULA imposed upon and granted to the BlogBurst community s registered users such as its registered distributors . Such rights include rights to receive reproduce distribute and perform various other activities with the contributor s content such as a limited distribution license for sublicensing the contributor s whole or partial content collections to distributors for republication on the distributors web sites. In accordance with the EULA such activities are performed and managed via controls and transformations in response to the BlogBurst server s execution of a software program.

In response to account registration information from the user e.g. the registered contributor the BlogBurst server a stores the users account registration information and b performs an additional e mail address verification by asking for the user s reply to an additional e mail message as shown in . As shown in the user replies to the additional e mail message by clicking a uniquely generated link ID to formally activate the user s account and the BlogBurst server registers such activation by recording such reply which is embedded in a web formatted uniform resource identifier URI .

In response to such activation the BlogBurst server saves the account registration information and prompts the contributor to log into the BlogBurst server as shown in and to save a browser cookie on the contributor s IHS for enabling automatic identification by the BlogBurst server on the contributor s subsequent visits from the same IHS as shown in . After the user is verified activated and logged into the BlogBurst server the BlogBurst server prompts the contributor to add its content collection e.g. a blog to the BlogBurst community s information set in addition to descriptive and annotative information that describes such content collection as shown in .

The BlogBurst server prompts the contributor to enter a Blog URL for a content collection to be added to the BlogBurst community as shown in . In response to the contributor specifying a URL for a content collection the BlogBurst server automatically performs a remote automatic search of the user s provided content collection via the network to determine a whether a syndication feed of such content collection is available b the XML format of the syndication feed and c the types of information provided in the discovered syndication feeds.

If the BlogBurst server discovers one or more syndication feeds as part of the content collection the BlogBurst server prompts the contributor to select the desired syndication feed and enter additional descriptive and annotative information about the content collection as shown in .

Conversely if the BlogBurst server does not discover at least one syndication feed as part of the content collection the Blog Burst server prompts the contributor to enter the specific URL of the syndication feed and enter additional descriptive and annotative information about the content collection as shown in .

In response to the contributor selecting or specifying a syndication feed the BlogBurst server a verifies logs and generates a preview of the syndication feed contents and b via the network outputs such preview to the contributor s IHS for display to the contributor as shown in . If the preview describes the contributor s previously specified format of the contributor s content collection the contributor outputs to the BlogBurst server via the network a validation of such fact by clicking a Next Claim Blog button as shown in . In response to such validation the BlogBurst server outputs via the network a summary page to the contributor s IHS for display to the contributor so that the summary page indicates that the content collection is ready to be claimed by the contributor and annotated for the benefit of organizers and distributors as shown in .

By clicking a Claim button as shown in the contributor outputs from the contributor s IHS to the BlogBurst server via the network a claim to the content collection. In response to such claim the Blog Burst server prompts the contributor to evidence that the contributor can and does operate the content collection by the contributor s choice of a inserting a specific selection of code in a particular content unit within the content collection as shown in b claiming the content collection through a third party aided authentication service as shown in or c automated communication e.g. in response to executing instructions of an application programming interface between the contributor s IHS or a server that stores the content collection on behalf of the contributor and the BlogBurst server according a predetermined protocol.

Next the contributor is presented with a summary information status page generated by the BlogBurst server which displays a listing of content collections their names and status as shown in . In response to the contributor s selection of a content collection by clicking in the screen of a link that is associated with the selected content collection the BlogBurst server outputs to the contributor s IHS a specific profile view page as shown in which shows a metadata about the selected content collection and b a content preview of the most recently contributed content units in the content collection. In response to the contributor clicking in the screen of an Edit button the BlogBurst server enables the contributor to annotate and describe the content collection in more detail as shown in . In response to the contributor clicking in the screen of a Save button the BlogBurst server receives via the network and stores such annotative and descriptive information from the contributor s IHS so that such information is available for subsequent display to the BlogBurst community s registered users e.g. registered organizers and distributors in the form of a profile view page as shown in . In response to the contributor clicking in the screen of an Edit button the BlogBurst server enables the contributor to edit its respective information via a profile editing page as shown in . In response to the contributor clicking in the screen on a Save button the BlogBurst server receives via the network and stores such edited information from the contributor s IHS.

Moreover via a web browsing program that is executed by a prospective contributor s IHS the BlogBurst server enables the prospective contributor to a access a web page at the BlogBurst server b click a Bloggers tab as shown in and c enter identification information to request a review of the prospective contributor s own content collection for possible invitation to join the BlogBurst community. In response to such request the BlogBurst server performs the verification steps that are discussed further hereinabove. In response to such verification the BlogBurst server alerts organizers to the prospective contributor s content collection so that the organizers may determine whether to invite the prospective contributor to join the BlogBurst community.

The e mail message invites the distributor to join the BlogBurst community. The e mail message invites the distributor to click a customized link that contains a system generated unique ID invitation code. In response to the distributor clicking such link which requests a web page from the BlogBurst server the BlogBurst server via such web page prompts the distributor via a web browsing program that is executed by the distributor s IHS to voluntarily provide account registration information to the BlogBurst server via the network as shown in in order to join the BlogBurst community. In this manner various distributors enter account settings and user information to describe themselves.

As shown in a distributor a provides account setup and login information and b accepts and agrees to a EULA between such distributor and the BlogBurst server s governing organization. The EULA specifies various obligations access rights distribution rights and other rights that are automatically under the EULA imposed upon and granted to the BlogBurst community s registered users. Such obligations include specific activity limitations on the distributor in which content units from various contributors are licensed to the distributor for republication on specified web pages of a specified web site and not necessarily on a other web pages b other web sites c e mail message distributions d other Internet transmission channels or e print titles except as otherwise designated within a master agreement between the distributor and the BlogBurst server s governing organization. In accordance with the EULA such activities are performed and managed via controls and transformations in response to the BlogBurst server s execution of a software program.

By suitably communicating via the network with a distributor s IHS the BlogBurst server makes the registered contributors content searchable by the distributor accessible to the distributor and redistributable by the distributor as discussed further hereinbelow. For example the BlogBurst server enables the distributor to a group content by selecting among a broad pool of content collections submitted by multiple contributors e.g. by selecting one or more content units one or more content collections and or all available content from one or more contributors b select among predefined collections of contributor content BurstWires which are assembled by organizers and c through a set of application programming interface API services redistribute such content which is so selected by such distributor to a specified web site of the distributor. Contents in the BlogBurst community e.g. as such contents are stored by the BlogBurst server are subject to the EULA as explained above which is agreed by the registered contributors.

Although the distributor selects such content from the registered contributors such content is subject to uniform restrictions imposed upon the distributor with respect to distribution author attribution and modification. Accordingly the BlogBurst server operates a as an aggregator and repository for specifically licensed content from participating registered contributors b as a broker of content by facilitating a distributor s search selection use and other activity with the contributors content and c as an electronic agent for the contributors by facilitating the distributor s direct searching and browsing of the contributors i profiles ii specific contributed content units iii content description information and iv contributor supplied descriptive information about content units.

In response to account registration information from the user e.g. the registered distributor the BlogBurst server a stores the user s account registration information and b performs an additional e mail address verification by asking for the user s reply to an additional e mail message similar to the manner discussed hereinabove with respect to the registered contributor in connection with . In response to a successful account registration the BlogBurst server saves the account registration information and prompts the distributor to log into the BlogBurst server as shown in and to save a browser cookie on the distributor s IHS for enabling automatic identification by the BlogBurst server on the distributor s subsequent visits from the same IHS. This process establishes a contractual relationship with the distributor for governing activity with content available via the BlogBurst server from contributors as specified in the EULA and controlled by the BlogBurst server which may be formed by multiple servers .

The BlogBurst server enables a distributor to create working folders for organizing the distributor s views of the content on the BlogBurst server. For example after the distributor logs into the BlogBurst server as shown in the distributor s IHS receives signals representing the screen of from the BlogBurst server and displays such screen to the distributor e.g. in response to the distributor clicking a My Library tab followed by clicking a My Folders tab .

As shown in if the distributor types a new working folder s name into a form and clicks a Save button the BlogBurst server creates the working folder having such name for such distributor. Or if the distributor clicks a delete hyperlink on the same line as an existing working folder s name the BlogBurst server deletes such working folder having such name for such distributor. By comparison in response to the distributor clicking an existing working folder s name which is displayed as a hyperlink in the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor s IHS displays information as shown in about such working folder to the distributor.

With reference to if the distributor wants to disassociate any part s of the listed content from such working folder the distributor a by checking one or more boxes adjacent to such part s of the listed content selects such part s that the distributor wants to so disassociate and b by clicking a Delete hyperlink causes the BlogBurst server to perform such disassociation of such selected part s .

As shown in if the distributor wants to publish all or part of the listed content on the distributor s web site e.g. a news web site the distributor a by checking one or more boxes adjacent to the listed content selects the content that the distributor wants to publish and b by clicking a pull down menu selects a channel e.g. section of the distributor s web site to which the selected content will be published. In that manner the BlogBurst server enables a distributor to select some or all content collections reassembled content collections and or individual content units as listed one or more working folders to be published on a channel of the distributor s web site.

Or if the distributor wants to review modify or add such channels a the distributor clicks an Output Channels tab in the screen of and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views the screen of .

As shown in if the distributor types a new channel s name into a form and clicks a Save button the BlogBurst server creates the channel having such name for such distributor. Or if the distributor clicks a delete hyperlink on the same line as an existing channel s name the BlogBurst server deletes such channel having such name for such distributor. By comparison in response to the distributor clicking an existing channel s name which is displayed as a hyperlink in the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor s IHS displays information as shown in about such channel to the distributor.

With reference to if the distributor wants to disassociate any part s of the listed content from such channel of the distributor s web site so that such listed content ceases being published on such channel the distributor a by checking one or more boxes adjacent to such part s of the listed content selects such part s that the distributor wants to so disassociate and b by clicking a Delete hyperlink causes the BlogBurst server to perform such disassociation of such selected part s .

If the distributor wants to search content a the distributor clicks a Search tab in the screen of and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views the screen of . As discussed further hereinabove registered contributors provide classification and descriptive information about themselves and their respective content collections. In the BlogBurst community this meta information about the contributors and such content is searchable by the distributors. Accordingly the BlogBurst server enables a distributor to search for content collections BurstWires and individual content units that match such distributor s specified criteria.

For example as shown in the BlogBurst server enables a distributor to search for blogs that match such distributor s specified criteria e.g. criteria specified as a search term travel . In response to the distributor clicking a Search button the BlogBurst server performs the search and outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views the screen of .

Similarly as shown in the BlogBurst server enables a distributor to search for posts that match such distributor s specified criteria e.g. criteria specified as a search term travel . In response to the distributor clicking a Search button the BlogBurst server performs the search and outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views the screen of .

Referring again to if the distributor wants to preview a channel e.g. Travel Section Destination San Francisco section a the distributor clicks a Preview button in the screen of and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views the screen of . shows a facsimile of the channel s BlogBurst content in reverse chronological order.

As discussed hereinabove the distributor benefits from the BlogBurst server s operation as a content delivery system for substantially real time communication of content according to the distributor s respective selection filtering and inclusion exclusion of content units. In response to the distributor s selections of various content e.g. blogs and or posts in the manner discussed hereinabove the Blog Burst server and the distributor s IHS and the server s that host s the distributor s web site s communicate with one another via the network through a rich set of remote callable APIs which automatically generate content for display on the distributor s web site s as agreed in the EULA between the distributor and the BlogBurst server s governing organization. For example the distributor is able to copy client side code either created by hand or automatically generated by the BlogBurst server that uses the APIs onto web pages of the distributor s web site s . Also the distributor is able to configure the server s that host s the distributor s web site s so that such server s automatically initiate s requests for manipulating such content on such server s before rendering such content on viewable rendered web pages of the distributor s web site s .

In this manner the BlogBurst server operates as a customized front end cache of numerous distributor output channels. This cache is accessible by the distributor via a BlogBurst server distributed API as permitted under the EULA. Periodically e.g. once per hour the BlogBurst server incrementally updates content that is redistributed through the distributor s channels in response to a newly contributed content units from registered contributors b the distributor s changes to its selections of content and c automatic or organizer managed changes to the distributor s selected BurstWires. The BlogBurst server formats and distributes content units in a customized manner according to various requests on a distributor by distributor basis. For example the BlogBurst server dynamically resizes content units and edits them for length so that the distributor s web site displays such content units as headlines only as shown in or as previewed excerpts as shown in the alternative example channel preview screen of or as a whole as shown in the alternative example channel preview screen of in a customized manner according to various requests on a distributor by distributor basis. Moreover the BlogBurst server specifically styles content units in the XML formatting guidelines in a customized manner according to various requests on a distributor by distributor basis as shown in L and M .

The BlogBurst server invites organizers and distributors to rate any content collection content unit or contributor on a 1 to 5 scale. In response to a user s rating of a collection unit or contributor the BlogBurst server stores the rating and presents a BlogBurst community wide average associated with such collection unit or contributor.

Changes to any of the BurstWires or custom syndication feeds are reflected in the BlogBurst server s operation as a front end cache if needed and or on a regular recurring basis so that the latest version of the content collection is available to the distributor and reflected on viewable rendered web pages of the distributor s web site s . With this changing caching refresh technique the BlogBurst server enables a substantially real time flow of re renderable content for use by distributors on their web site s . Accordingly on a substantially continuous basis the BlogBurst server applies updates by registered contributors updates by organizers and updates or revised filtering preferences by distributors to the endpoint at which such content is accessed by the distributor and on viewable rendered web pages of the distributor s web site s .

As discussed further hereinabove the BlogBurst server enables the distributor to search for content that matches such distributor s search term s . Also the BlogBurst server enables the distributor to search for content according to categories that are assembled by organizers. If the distributor wants to search for content according to such categories the distributor clicks a Content tab followed by a Browse tab which are shown in the screen of . As shown in the left column of the BlogBurst server enables the distributor to a review content in all categories b review content in a particular category and c review uncategorized content. As further shown in the left column of the BlogBurst server identifies to the distributor a a total count of blogs BurstWires other bundled content groups and other content units in all categories and b for each category a total count of blogs BurstWires other bundled content groups and other content units in such category.

For example if the distributor wants to review content in a particular category e.g. Automotive Transportation category which has fifty four blogs BurstWires other bundled content groups and other content units in the example of a the distributor selects the particular category by clicking the particular category s hyperlinked name in the left column of and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views a list of such content in the right column of .

In the right column of the distributor views a list of blogs and their short descriptions that exist within the particular category. Similarly if the distributor wants to view a list of BurstWires and other bundled content groups and their short descriptions that exist within the particular category a the distributor clicks a Wires Bundles tab and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views such list. Or if the distributor wants to view a complete list of all content units and their previews that exist within the particular category a the distributor clicks a Posts tab and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views such list.

Further as shown in the BlogBurst server enables a distributor to search within the particular category for content that matches such distributor s specified search terms. For example in response to the distributor typing the search terms and clicking a Search button the BlogBurst server performs the search and outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views a list of content within the particular category that matches the distributor s specified search terms.

Moreover in the left column the distributor views a list of subcategories within the particular category along with a total count of blogs BurstWires other bundled content groups and other content units in each subcategory. Accordingly if the distributor wants to review content in a particular subcategory e.g. Aviation subcategory within the Automotive Transportation category a the distributor selects the particular subcategory by clicking the particular subcategory s hyperlinked name in the left column of and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views a list of such content.

If the distributor wants to view a profile of a particular blog a the distributor selects the particular blog by clicking the particular blog s hyperlinked name in the right column of and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views the screen of .

If the distributor wants to review a profile of the individual or entity that controls such blog a the distributor click a View Blogger Profile hyperlink in and b in response thereto the Blog Burst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views such profile.

If the distributor wants to add such blog into a working folder the distributor clicks an Add to . . . pull down menu in to select one of the distributor s working folders into which such blog will be added by the BlogBurst server.

For showing the recent activity with such blog shows a date time of the BlogBurst server s most recent attempted refresh e.g. downloading of such blog s content units from the server e.g. server that hosts such blog and b date time of the BlogBurst server s most recent successful refresh of such blog s content units from the server that hosts such blog. Also shows a a total number of posts that exist within such blog and b a chart that graphically illustrates a number of posts that were added to such blog per each of the most recent 30 days.

If the distributor wants to modify a manner in which content is displayed by a channel a the distributor clicks a My Library tab followed by a My Widgets tab in the screen of and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views a Validation section in the right column of .

The Validation section shows a list of channels that have been created by the distributor as discussed further hereinabove in connection with . For modifying a manner in which content is displayed by a particular channel a the distributor clicks the particular channel s hyperlinked name and an Edit Display Options hyperlink in the Validation section and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views a Display Options section of for the particular channel. Similarly for modifying a layout e.g. size and position within a window of content that is displayed by a particular channel a the distributor clicks the particular channel s hyperlinked name and an Edit Layout hyperlink in the Validation section and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views a suitable screen for modifying such layout.

As shown in the Display Options section of the BlogBurst server enables the distributor to specify a fonts and colors in which various types of content are displayed by the particular channel b a number of posts that are displayed by the particular channel c a manner of selecting such posts that are so displayed and d action to be taken in response to a user clicking one of such posts that are so displayed e.g. by the user clicking a displayed post s hyperlinked headline . By clicking a Save button the distributor causes the BlogBurst server to save such specifications for the particular channel.

If the distributor wants to change the number of posts that are displayed by the particular channel the distributor clicks a first pull down menu in to select a different number. If the distributor wants to change the manner of selecting such posts that are so displayed e.g. sequence of such posts the distributor clicks a second pull down menu in to select one of the following options for the particular channel a Blog Diversity for selecting such posts in a rotating manner so that posts are so displayed with equal priority b Most Recent for selecting the most recent posts which are to be so displayed c Popularity for selecting the most frequently viewed posts which are to be so displayed and d Editorial Rating for selecting the highest rated posts which are to be so displayed.

Further as shown in if the distributor wants to change the action to be taken in response to a user clicking a displayed post s hyperlinked headline the distributor clicks a suitable one of the following options for the particular channel a Go to originating blog so that such action includes displaying e.g. to such user via a web browsing program that is executed by such user s IHS the web site of the blog that contains such post and b Link to Post View widget at so that such action includes displaying e.g. to such user via a web browsing program that is executed by such user s IHS a distributor specified web page that downloads such post e.g. downloads such post from the BlogBurst server or alternatively from the web site of the blog that contains such post . Such downloading by the distributor specified web page occurs a in a first example automatically in response to such user clicking the displayed post s hyperlinked headline and b in a second example periodically e.g. once per hour in a manner independent of such user clicking the displayed post s hyperlinked headline.

In one implementation the distributor specified web page is part of the distributor s web site s . In another implementation the distributor specified web page is part of a web site that is hosted by the BlogBurst server in which case the BlogBurst server outputs such post for display to such user e.g. via a web browsing program that is executed by such user s IHS in a manner that complies with the distributor s specified layout and display options.

In response to the distributor clicking a Preview button the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views a Preview section of for the particular channel. By clicking a Refresh hyperlink the distributor causes the BlogBurst server to refresh e.g. update such preview. By clicking a Fullscreen Preview hyperlink the distributor causes the BlogBurst server to refresh e.g. update such preview in a fullscreen view.

The BlogBurst server records a a number of times that a content unit s headline is viewed headline impressions b a number of times that a content unit s full content is viewed full post impressions and c a number of times that a content unit s embedded hyperlink is clicked by a user for navigation to another web site click throughs such as for navigation to an advertiser s web site. The BlogBurst server reports such information to the contributor of such content unit in a manner that supports accounting of financial compensation if any a due from distributors and or the BlogBurst server s governing organization to the contributor as consideration for such viewing and or b owed to distributors and or the BlogBurst server s governing organization by the contributor as consideration for such viewing.

If the distributor wants to review a number of headline impressions full post impressions and click throughs that occurred aggregately via all distributors web site s a the distributor clicks a Reports tab followed by an Impressions tab in the screen of and b in response thereto the BlogBurst server outputs signals to the distributor s IHS so that the distributor views a Headline Impressions for All Publishers section of .

This section of shows a chart that graphically illustrates a number of headline impressions that occurred aggregately via all distributors web site s per each of the most recent 7 days. As shown in the BlogBurst server enables the distributor to operate a first pull down menu for selecting whether such chart illustrates a number of full post impressions or a number of click throughs e.g. instead of a number of headline impressions . Also this section of shows a table that lists a number of headline impressions full post impressions and click throughs that occurred aggregately via all distributors web site s per each of the most recent 7 days.

As shown in the BlogBurst server enables the distributor to operate a a second pull down menu for specifying a different period of time e.g. instead of the most recent 7 days and b a third pull down menu for reviewing a number of headline impressions full post impressions and click throughs that occurred via the distributor s web site s e.g. instead of aggregately via all distributors web site s . Accordingly the BlogBurst server records such numbers of headline impressions full post impressions and click throughs on a distributor by distributor basis in a manner that supports accounting of financial compensation if any a owed to contributors and or the BlogBurst server s governing organization by the distributor as consideration for such viewing and or b due from contributors and or the BlogBurst server s governing organization to the distributor as consideration for such viewing.

Moreover the BlogBurst server executes software for automatically a detecting content units that have errors incomplete content inefficient coding potentially harmful coding and or offensive wording and b in response thereto revising or blocking such detected content units so that content units are more efficiently redistributable by distributors. For example the BlogBurst server executes software for automatically normalizing HTML of content units such as by a balancing tags b imposing well formed structures and c converting relative links and images to absolute links and images.
