The present invention relates to a device for evaporating volatile liquids for example air fresheners and insecticides. The invention relates in particular to a device for evaporating volatile liquids from a container into a room with the assistance of electrical power.

Devices are known in which a bottle of volatile liquid has a wick projecting therefrom and the device has a heater that is located in the vicinity of the distal end of the wick to accelerate the evaporation of volatile liquid from the wick. The bottle wick and heater are retained within a casing which carries an electric plug. To operate the heater the device is plugged into a wall socket. Known devices of this type allege to allow control of the rate of evaporation of the volatile liquids for example by varying the relative position of the wick and the heater.

A further disadvantage of current devices is the phenomenon of habituation which occurs especially when one is exposed over a period of time to a constant level of volatile active.

EP 1196203 describes a method of overcoming this phenomenon whereby a constant supply of volatile active is combined with a periodic supply of the same active thereby modulating the total supply in a manner which is constantly changing. This is effected by a manually operated switch on the device.

A further method of overcoming this phenomenon is demonstrated in the device shown in WO 2006 042873 wherein a boost of delivery of a volatile active can be selected by manually pressing a button said boost being delivered either by a fan or by a further heater or by both.

All of the above mentioned prior art suffer from the drawback of efficiency and convenience in that the user has to manually change the apparatus from normal to boost or modulate mode and then to switch it back to normal mode when this effect is no longer necessary e.g. when the room is empty or at night . Given the typical location of sources of electrical supply on walls at a low level near the floor this makes the process more inefficient and inconvenient.

There is a need therefore for a device which overcomes the defects of the prior art and provides a timely and efficient alteration of the fragrance supply to a room thereby overcoming the effects of habituation whilst at the same time minimising excess delivery of volatile active. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided therefore a device for evaporating a volatile liquid from a container having a wick with a proximal end region within the container and a distal end region above the container the device comprising 

and wherein the motion sensor means is operable in use to detect motion in the vicinity of the device and on detecting motion is further operable to cause the activation of at least one of a second electrical heating means a fan a region of increased heating capacity within the first electrical heating means.

Preferably when in use the motion sensor means detects motion in the vicinity of the device the sensor means is operable to cause the activation of at least two of a second electrical heating means a fan a region of increased heating capacity within the first electrical heating means.

Even more preferably when in use the motion sensor means detects motion in the vicinity of the device the sensor means is operable to cause the activation of a second electrical heating means and a fan and a region of increased heating capacity within the first electrical heating means.

In one embodiment the first electrical heating means may be operable in use and in the absence of motion being detected to activate on a routine cycle where said first heating means is activated for a period of time t followed by a rest period of non activation x . tmay have an range of 0.1 120 minutes and x have a range of 0.1 120 minutes. Preferably thas a range of 5 90 minutes and x has a range of 5 60 minutes. Most preferably thas a range of 20 60 minutes and x has a range of 10 30 minutes.

When motion is detected in use the at least one of a second electrical heating means a fan and or a region of increased heating capacity within the first heating means may be operable to activate for a period of time t followed by a rest period of non activation y .

tmay have an range of 1 120 minutes and y have a range of 1 60 minutes. Preferably thas a range of 10 90 minutes and y has a range of 5 30 minutes. Most preferably thas a range of 20 60 minutes and y has a range of 10 20 minutes.

Preferably thas a range of 0.05 89.95 minutes and thas a range of 0.05 89.95 minutes. Most preferably thas a range of 0.05 59.95 minutes and thas a range of 0.05 59.95 minutes

In an alternative embodiment the first electrical heating means may be operable in use and in the absence of motion being detected to be activated constantly.

When motion is detected in use the at least one of a second electrical heating means a fan and or a region of increased heating capacity within the first heating means may be operable to activate for a period of time t followed by a rest period of non activation y . tmay have a range of 1 120 minutes and y have a range of 1 60 minutes. Preferably thas a range of 10 90 minutes and y has a range of 5 30 minutes. Most preferably thas a range of 20 60 minutes and y has a range of 10 20 minutes.

Preferably the first and or second heating means and or fan may be located within the device in a position substantially adjacent to the area where the distil end of the wick would be located when a container is releasably secured to the housing.

The device of the present invention may be advantageous because the device is adapted to be responsive to the conditions of the environment surrounding it. In particular when the device senses motion in the surrounding vicinity it is operable to increase the rate of volatilisation thus in use increasing the quantity of volatilised liquid in the environment surrounding the device. This increase in volatilisation may be capable of minimising or overcoming the habituation phenomenon.

When present rest periods x and y may advantageously provide the device with a degree of self regulation to prevent the device in use from causing volatilisation every time motion is detected. This may also prevent the environment surrounding the device from becoming saturated with volatilised liquid.

The motion sensor means may be provided in the form of at least one of an infrared IR sensor a laser sensor and a sound sensor.

The IR sensor which is preferably a passive IR sensor may be operable to detect radiation in the infrared spectrum thus be capable of detecting the presence of a person or an animal within the vicinity of the device. The laser sensor may be operable to emit one or more laser beams and be adapted to detect when an object breaks the one or more beams by moving across the beam s thus indicating the presence of a person or an animal within the vicinity of the device. The sound sensor may be operable to detect sound within the vicinity of the device and preferably once the detected sound exceeds a predefined level this is indicative of movement within the vicinity of the device.

Preferably the motion sensor means is provided in the form of at least two of an infrared IR sensor a laser sensor and a sound sensor. Most preferably the motion sensor means is provided in the form of an infrared IR sensor and a laser sensor and a sound sensor.

Motion within the vicinity of a device according to the present invention may be defined as one or more motion events within the vicinity of the device. The motion sensor means may be operable to detect each motion event within the vicinity of the device and communicate each event to the controller and or directly to the first and or second heating means and or fan. Alternatively or additionally the motion sensor means may only communicate the detection of a motion event to the controller once a predefined number of motion events have been detected. As a further alternative or additional arrangement the controller may only communicate with the first and or second heating means and or fan once a predefined number of motion events have been communicated to the controller by the motion sensor means.

The number of predefined motion events that may be required in order to cause the activation of the first and or second heating means and or fan may be fixed or may be selectable by a user. The possibility for a user to select the number of predetermined motion events required to trigger the activation may be advantageous as a user can modify the number based on the location of the device and the user s requirements of the device.

The first and or second heating means may be provided in any suitable form such as a bar heater or at least one point source resistor. Preferably said heating means is are provided in the form of at least one electrical resistor such as a thermistor.

The first and or second heating means may be able to provide in use heat to the distal end of a wick in the range of 50 120 C. preferably heat in the range of 50 100 C. and most preferably heat in the range of 55 90 C.

Alternatively of additionally the first and or second heating means may be able to provide in use heat to the distal end of a wick in the range of 40 95 of the flash point of the volatile liquid preferably heat in the range of 50 90 and most preferably heat in the range of 55 75 .

Preferably there is a controller operably connected to the motion sensor means. The controller may also be operably connected to the first and or second heating means and or fan to control the operation thereof relative to each other.

The electrical power applied to the device may by provided by any suitable form such as by mains electricity batteries or solar cells. However due to the power demands of the heating means mains electricity is preferred.

Where the device is intended for use with mains electricity the device may be provided with plug formations configured to engage the openings in a mains electrical socket. Alternatively a device for use with mains electricity may be provided with a cable having plug formations located at a distal end thereof to permit the device to be located remotely from a mains electrical socket.

Where the device is provided with the plug formations the formations are located toward a generally rear facing aspect of the housing and in this arrangement the securing means can be located in a lower facing aspect of the housing and the upper aperture of the chimney means can be located in an upper aspect of the housing.

The housing may be providing with one or more exit chimney means to facilitate the emanation of the volatilised liquid from the device. Additionally the housing may have one or more vents suitable to allow the fan to draw a current of air through the device toward the location of the distal end of the wick of a container when said container is releasably engaged with the device.

The housing is preferably substantially open toward the lower aspect thereof to permit convenient access to and sight of a container when releasably held by the securing means. This arrangement may be advantageous since a user will be able to visually monitor the level of volatile liquid remaining in the container.

Alternatively the housing may substantially surround the container when the container is held by the securing means. This arrangement may be advantageous as an engaged container may be less susceptible to being tampered with. Additionally this arrangement may permit the device to have an improved aesthetic from a consumer perspective.

The securing means may engage any part of the container to ensure the position of the container in relation to the device. Preferably the securing means are arranged to engage with an upper portion of the container since this arrangement may facilitate a more reliable positioning of the wick within the device.

Alternatively the securing means may engage a lower portion of the container. This arrangement may be particularly useful where the housing is arranged to substantially surround an engaged container.

The volatile liquid may be provided in the form of an air freshener a deodorant a perfume an odourant an insecticide a fungicide and or variants thereof.

The device may be operable in a normal mode or a detection mode wherein in normal mode the first electrical heating means may be operable in use to activate continually or at the time interval of t depending on the embodiment and wherein in detection mode the motion sensor means may be operable in use to detect motion in the vicinity of the device and communicate any detection to the controller and or the first and or second electrical heating means and or fan to cause the activation thereof at the time interval of t.

The device may be switchable between the normal mode and the detection mode. The device may be manually and or automatically switchable between the normal mode and the detection mode. Automatic switching between normal mode and detection mode may be controlled by a timing mechanism and or a sensor operably connected to the controller such as a light sensor and or sound detection means.

The incorporation of a timing mechanism to effect the switching of the device between a normal mode and a detection mode may be advantageous as a user can select when the detection mode may be operable thus providing a user with a greater level of control of the rate of volatilisation in response to motion being detected. This level of control will also permit a user to conserve the power consumption of the device by controlling the amount of time the device is in the detection mode thus controlling when the motion sensor means may consume power.

Furthermore the incorporation of a sensor to effect the switching of the device between a normal mode and a detection mode may be advantageous as a user can allow the device to automatically cause the switching between a normal mode and a detection mode providing a user with a greater level of control in response to motion being detected. For instance a light sensor may be used to only allow the switching when light is detected such that motion at night does not cause additional activation. Whereas a sound detection means may permit the switching into the detection mode only when sound is detected thus preventing the motion sensor means from consuming power until sound is detected the sound possibly being indicative of the environment around the device being used.

The device may be provided with an indicator wherein said indicator is operable to indicate to a user what function the device is currently performing. The indicator may be operable to provide a visual indication and or provide an audible indication.

Preferably the indicator is configured to provide a visual indication by emitting light from one or more light sources preferably one or more LEDs.

The one or more light sources may be adapted to emit a different colour of light to indicate the current function the device is performing. Additionally or alternatively the one or more light sources may blink or flash to indicate the current function the device is performing.

Alternatively or additionally the device may be operable to visually indicate the function currently being performed by the device via a screen. The screen may be an LCD screen that is adapted to provide a message to a user for instance such messages could include ON SENSING MOTION DETECTED RESTING NORMAL MODE DETECTION MODE OFF .

The device may be provided with a boost mechanism. The boost mechanism may be linked to a user operated switch or button or the like. On operating the boost mechanism the activation of at least one of a second electrical heating means a fan a region of increased heating capacity within the first electrical heating means may occur regardless of the current mode of operation of the device. In effect the boost mechanism may provide the user with a control to override the operation of the device to initiate a specific activation.

According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided therefore a method of evaporating a volatile liquid from a container of volatile liquid the method comprising the steps of 

loading a container of volatile liquid into a device according to the first aspect of the present invention 

placing the device in an operational mode wherein the motion sensor means is capable of detecting motion in the vicinity of the device 

and wherein upon detection of motion by said motion sensor means said motion causes the activation of at least one of a second electrical heating means a fan a region of increased heating capacity within the first electrical heating means.

According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided therefore a kit of parts for evaporating a quantity of volatile liquid said kit comprising a device in accordance with the first aspect of the present invention said device being adapted to operate in accordance with the method according to the second aspect of the present invention and further comprising a container of fluid wherein said container is configured to be loadable into the housing of the device.

In general terms the device illustrated in is shown with a container of volatile liquid engaged therewith. The container has a reservoir portion in the form of a glass bottle containing a volatile liquid and a wick extending into the bottle. The wick also extends above the top of the bottle through a seal and into a chimney means of the device . The wick may be substantially cylindrical. The seal is present to retain the liquid within the bottle should the device be knocked over and or inverted when the container is engaged therewith.

The device has a housing which partially extends over the container and its upper part. From the rear wall of the housing extends electrical plug formations .

The top of the housing has a generally circular central aperture which defines the upper aperture of the chimney means. The upper aperture is aligned with a co axial lower aperture not shown thus defining a channel therebetween for volatilised liquid to flow up and out of the upper aperture into the environment surrounding the device .

A first electrical heating means and second electrical heating means if present may be provided in the form of separate resistors and preferably as positive temperature coefficient PTC thermistors. However either of both of the first or second electrical heating means could be provided by way of a ring heater or the like or a combination thereof.

An electrical fan may also be provided. All of the fan and the first and second electrical heating means are in operable communication either directly or indirectly with a motion sensor means illustrated as a PIR motion sensor in .

Indirect operable communication may be via a controller not shown which could act as the principal receiver of information from the motion sensor process the provided information and direct the control of the aforementioned components.

An example of one mode of operation of the device and the inter relation of the components will now be explained.

The device must first be placed in an operational mode. There may be a user activated switch not shown to permit the device to be switched into the operational mode. The device will draw power from the power source which is depicted as plug formations to draw mains electrical power this could be from solar cells mounted on the device and or one or more batteries however.

Initiating the operational mode will cause the first heater means to warm up to a temperature that will cause the evaporation of the volatile liquid from the device . In the absence of the detection mode and or motion being detected the first heater means will continue to impart heat toward the wick for a period of time tand at the end of tthe heater means will go into a rest period for time x where the heater means will not draw any power.

However the motion sensor means may also draw power either constantly or periodically in order to sense for movement in the vicinity of the device . If the motion sensor means senses movement it is operable to communicate this information to the controller not shown . Once the controller has received this information it is operable to instruct the activation of at least one of the second heater means the fan and or a range of higher temperature in the first heater means thus causing an increase in the rate of evaporation of the volatile liquid for a time interval of t. At the end of time interval tthe at least one of the second heater means the fan and or a range of higher temperature in the first heater means will go into a rest period for time interval y where said means and or fan will not draw any power.

Subsequent detection of motion by the motion sensor means may also be communicated to the controller which will cause the activation of the at least one of the second heater means the fan and or a range of higher temperature in the first heater means means only if time period y has elapsed.

When the device is first placed in an operational mode the controller may cause the activation to occur substantially immediately or after a short delay say after 2 minutes.

Alternatively the controller may after the first heater means has been activated following being placed in an operational mode and on being informed of detection of motion within the vicinity of the device delay causing the activation of the at least one of the second heater means the fan and or a range of higher temperature in the first heater means until a predetermined interval of time thas elapsed. Once time period thas elapsed subsequent activation following the detection of motion would take place at a time interval of t.

Alternatively when the operational mode is initiated the first heater means will warm up to a temperature that will cause evaporation of the volatile liquid and this heater means will remain activated without rest period x.

The device may be manually or automatically switchable between a normal mode and a detection mode. Such automatic switching may be controlled by a timing mechanism and or a sensor operably connected to the controller such as a light sensor and or sound detection means. The automatic switching may permit the device to consume less power by only permitting the device to operate in the detection mode of a limited period of time thus conserving the power consumed by the motion sensor means . Such conservation of power being particularly useful where the device is powered by batteries and or solar cell s .

The motion sensor means may have a lens cover which protrudes from the front of the device to ensure a wide field of view. This may be advantageous where the motion sensor means is a passive infra red sensor since the motion would not need to be directly in front of the sensor means to be detected. Similarly where the motion sensor means is additionally or alternatively provided as a laser sensor this will also afford such sensors a wide field of view.

The illustrated device is shown having an indicator which is provided in the form of an LED. The LED s may be operable to provide a visual indication of the function currently being performed by the device. For instance the LED could indicate when the device is in an operational mode by emitting a constant light which is converted to a flashing operation when motion has been detected.

The indicator may also be provided with an audio component not shown wherein this component is capable of giving an audible alert when a particular function is being performed and or motion has been detected or the like.

Alternatively or additionally a screen such as an LCD screen could be presented on a prominent part of the device to provide a message to a user indicating the current functioning of the device . For instance such messages could include ON SENSING MOTION DETECTED RESTING NORMAL MODE DETECTION MODE OFF .

The above description describes an embodiment comprising a controller however where the controller is not present the components may be inter connected to be operably communicative with each other to implement the above mentioned operational relationship.
