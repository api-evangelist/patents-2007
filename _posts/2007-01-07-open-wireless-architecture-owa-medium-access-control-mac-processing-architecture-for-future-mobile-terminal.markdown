This invention is directed to a software architecture for future open wireless architecture OWA mobile terminal which provides an open and secured software platform to deliver the truly service oriented architecture rather than the wireless standard specific architecture across various air interfaces with multi dimensional mobility handovers for the complete fixed mobile and wireless communications convergence. The terminal system includes capabilities for maximizing the spectrum utilization efficiency and optimizing the system and transmission resource managements across the multi layered service offerings by the OWA mobile device.

In the future wireless service provision will be characterized by global mobile access terminal and personal mobility high quality of services full coverage intelligible no drop and no lower call blocking and latency and easy and simple access to multimedia services for voice data message video world wide web GPS etc. via ONE user SINGLE terminal.

This vision from the user perspective can be implemented by integration of these different evolving and emerging wireless access technologies in a common flexible and expandable platform to provide a multiplicity of possibilities for current and future services and applications to users in a single terminal. Systems of fourth generation mobile communications will mainly be characterized by a horizontal communication model where different access technologies as cellular cordless wireless local area network WLAN type systems short range wireless connectivity broadband wireless access system and wired systems will be combined on a common platform to complement each other in an optimum way for different service requirements and radio environments which is technically called Converged Broadband Wireless and Mobility Platform or Open Wireless Architecture OWA in a more technical sense .

OWA defines the open interfaces in wireless networks and systems including base band signal processing parts RF radio frequency parts networking parts and OS operating system and applications services parts so that the system can support different industrial standards and integrate the various wireless networks into an open broadband mobility platform.
