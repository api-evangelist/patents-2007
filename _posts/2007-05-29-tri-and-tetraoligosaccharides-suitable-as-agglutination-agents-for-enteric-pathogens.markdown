This application is the U.S. National Phase under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application PCT EP2007 055187 filed May 29 2007 which claims priority to EP 06447074.3 filed May 30 2006.

This invention relates to the use of tri and tetra oligo saccharides or their extracts or their derivatives or mixtures thereof as agglutination agent for pathogens. In particular it relates to the use of tri and tetra oligo saccharides or their extracts or their derivatives or mixtures thereof to improve the microbial ecosystem in the gastrointestinal tract of the animal by specific enumeration of enteric pathogens followed by specific excretion in order to improve weight gain to reduce feed conversion and to improve in this way the feed value and health and well being of the animal.

In modern animal production systems the equilibrium between the intestinal flora and host animal is a delicate one and disturbance of this equilibrium by e.g. bacterial infection has a negative impact on the overall performance of the animals Eckel 1999 . Knowledge about the problems of intestinal microbial infection in livestock opens the door to completely new ways of influencing the bio regulatory processes through feed additives reducing the frequency of diarrhea and even losses by stabilising the intestinal flora. In the past this infection problem was partially solved by supplying feeds containing antibiotics as growth promoter.

But today 50 years since the discovery of the traditional antimicrobials e.g. penicillin a lot of bacteria are now resistant to one and in many cases to multiple antimicrobials Guillot 1989 . This resistance is proving fatal for thousands of people each year and results in high medical and heavy economic costs Barton 1998 . The problem of antimicrobial resistance is global but is partially caused by the world wide application of antimicrobials in animal nutrition since addition of them to feed formulations resulted in better performance decreased feed conversions and higher growth rates Dupont and Steele 1987 Prescott 1997 and since more than half of all antimicrobial use was associated with animal production Aarestrup 1999 . For some countries e.g. the European Union this led already to a prohibition of all antimicrobials usable as growth promoters in feed formulations Muirhead 1998 Ross 1999 .

The problem with most traditional antimicrobials and other growth promoters in use today is that they attack bacteria at the intracellular level Guillot 1989 . That is they inhibit key enzymes in the synthesis of compounds used to build up the cell. Whenever this approach is used bacteria can develop mutations of the enzymes involved or can develop mechanisms to rapidly pump the antimicrobial out of the cell. Alternatively they can develop enzymes which directly degrade the antimicrobial e.g. lactamase Neu et al. 1980 Chirica et al. 1998 . By plasmid transfer via microbial conjugation resistance can be rapidly transferred from one microbial cell to another expansion of resistance Finland 1971 Hedges and Jacob 1974 Thompson 1986 Hamilton 1994 .

Since the world wide negative response on the use of the traditional antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal feeds research is performed to search for new types of natural antimicrobials or growth promoters mainly with another mode of action Mazza 1998 . During research for alternative natural antimicrobials attention is nowadays mainly focussed on the use of several organic acids Eckel 1997 Liang 1997 Radecki et al. 1988 new active probiotics Chiquette and Banchaar 1998 Garriga et al. 1998 Tannock 1999 prebiotics Olsen 1996 Bower et al. 1998 Brown et al. 1998 Iji and Tivey 1998 Houdijk et al. 1999 some plant onions and garlic and herb extracts essential oils De Koning and Hongbiao 1999 Nielsen 1999 .

In order that the present invention may be more clearly understood the preferred form will be described with reference to the following examples.

3 40 one day old chickens were provided with following feeds control feed control feed supplemented with 3 ppm flavomycin and control feed supplemented with 0.025 tri and or tetra manno oligo saccharides. The control feed was a mash feed composed of raw materials suitable for animal nutrition. Water and feed were supplied ad libitum. The chickens were contaminated at day 2 with caecum contents of 3 week old chickens most critical period for gastrointestinal problems . At regular time intervals chickens were dissected and the enteric pathogen contents in the small intestine were determined by plate counting on MacConkey agar. summarises the results.

From it is clear that tri and or tetra manno oligo saccharides has during the first week a positive effect on enteric bacteria growth survival. Only after one week the enteric bacteria content in the intestinal tract lowers very quickly even to a level lower then the control and flavomycin treatment.

The same experimental conditions were applied as described in experiment 1. In this example daily growth and feed conversion were monitored after 13 days. The results are summarised in table 1.

From table 1 it can be concluded that use of tri and or tetra galacturonic oligo saccharides in this particular test gave similar results as those obtained with a traditional growth promoter flavomycin . Nevertheless the mode of action is not comparable see example 1 

At the start of the trial 5 piglets were housed per pen. For each pen one feeder ad libitum was installed for solid pelleted feed. One drinking nipple was installed per pen. The temperature at start was at 28 C. until 10 days after weaning. Afterwards temperature was decreases to 25 C. Commercial non medicated diets were given. Non medicated means that the piglet doesn t receive any therapeutic antibiotics before and during the trial. The diets were given in the form of pellet.

Design of the trial was as follows 2 treatments Co and Tr 16 replicates 5 piglets At the start of the trial the piglets about 7 kg body weight were allocated to the different pens by weight. This allocation was made in order to have an equal average weight and an equal standard deviation of the average weight for each treatment and pen. At regular time intervals the piglets were weighed and feed consumption was monitored. This resulted in a daily growth daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio table 2 .

From table 2 it can be concluded that zootechnical parameters of the piglets improve by supplying them manno oligo saccharides.

Tri and or tetra manno oligo saccharides were incubated in liquid at a dose of 0.025 at pH 7.0 with K88 and cells for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes agglutination was visualised by means of microscopic analysis. shows the result. From it is clear that tri and or tetra manno oligo saccharides are able to agglutinate K88 cells and not cells. This means that pathogenic germs are agglutinated by tri and or tetra manno oligo saccharides.

Xylose tri xylo oligo saccharides tetra xylo oligo saccharides penta xylo oligo saccharides en deca xylo oligo saccharides were incubated at a dose of 0.025 at pH 7.0 with K88 and cells for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes agglutination was visualised by means of microscopic analysis. It was clear best agglutination was obtained with tri xylo oligo saccharides and tetra xylo oligo saccharides. This means that pathogenic germs are preferably agglutinated by tri and or tetra xylo oligo saccharides.
