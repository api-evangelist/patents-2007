This is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 107 885 filed Mar. 27 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 189 571 in the names of Alexander S. Borovik Ziyun Wang Chongying Xu and Thomas H. Baum for METHOD FOR TRACE WATER ANALYSIS IN CYCLIC SILOXANES USEFUL AS PRECURSORS FOR LOW DIELECTRIC CONSTANT THIN FILMS issued Mar. 13 2007 as U.S. Pat. No. 7 189 571. The disclosure of said U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 107 885 is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Priority is claimed under the provisions of 35 USC 120.

The present invention relates generally to a method for measuring the water content in siloxanes particularly cyclic siloxanes such as tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane TMCTS useful as precursors to low dielectric constant thin films.

As the need for integrated circuits for semiconductor devices having higher performance and greater functionality increases device feature geometries continue to decrease. As device geometries become smaller the dielectric constant of an insulating material used between conducting paths becomes an increasingly important factor in device performance.

As device dimensions shrink to less than 0.25 m propagation delay cross talk noise and power dissipation due to resistance capacitance RC coupling become significant due to increased wiring capacitance especially interline capacitance between the metal lines on the same level. These factors all depend critically on the dielectric constant of the separating insulator or inter layer dielectric ILD .

The use of low dielectric constant k materials advantageously lowers power consumption reduces cross talk and shortens signal delay for closely spaced conductors through the reduction of both nodal and interconnect line capacitances. Dielectric materials that exhibit low dielectric constants are critical in the development path toward faster and more power efficient microelectronics.

Alkyl silanes alkoxy silanes and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes POSS and other materials comprised mainly of Si C O and H SiCOH are being evaluated aggressively for obtaining low dielectric constant k thin films as interlayer dielectrics in an integrated circuit by a PECVD approach. The resulting films formed when using these precursors give dense SiCOH containing films having dielectric constants in the range of from about 2.4 to 3.2.

Introducing porosity to the low dielectric constant SiCOH films may serve to further lower the dielectric constant to values below 2.5.

One particular class of precursors cyclosiloxanes i.e. 2 4 6 8 tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane TMCTS is being considered as a source material for the deposition of low dielectric constant k thin films used as interlayer dielectrics in an integrated circuit. Cyclosiloxanes provide a thin film having an open crystal structures or cage structure e.g. Mantz et al. Thermolysis of Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane POSS Macromers and POSS Siloxane Copolymers Chem. Mater. 1996 8 1250 1259 . PECVD of thin films from such precursors results in open areas in the structure which leads to low packing density and hence low k values.

Chemical vapor deposition CVD is the thin film deposition method of choice for large scale fabrication of microelectronic device structures and the semiconductor manufacturing industry has extensive expertise in its use.

The purification and reproducible delivery of cyclosiloxanes for CVD is extremely critical for full scale commercialization of the thin film process. At present the PECVD deposition process is suffering from irreproducible delivery due to polymerization of TMCTS within the delivery lines and process hardware. Questions related to the purification of TMCTS and elimination of the polymerization must be considered. The exact polymerization mechanism is presently not known. However studies by the inventors of the instant invention indicate that catalytic polymerization of siloxanes occurs in the presence of water moisture acids and bases. Accordingly there is a need in the art to reduce water content as well as other catalytic species from siloxanes providing improved purity stability and utility.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 015 326 filed on Dec. 31 2001 discloses a novel method for reducing water levels in cyclic siloxanes to levels as low as 2 ppm by drying the material through physical absorption methods and or azeotropic distillation. However despite such efforts a reliable method for the trace water analysis of cyclic siloxanes is not known.

Karl Fischer titration a commonly used quality control method for water analysis fails to deliver accurate measurements of water for cyclosiloxane materials as the Karl Fischer reagents are not compatible with many cyclosiloxanes. For example Karl Fischer reagents based on the following redox reaction SO I 2HO HSO 2HI 1 

However in the case of cyclosiloxanes the Ireacts with the Si H groups to give a false positive according to the following mechanism shown with tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane 

Fourier Transform Infra Red FTIR Spectroscopy another commonly used analytical technique for measuring water concentrations in many chemicals has detection limits of greater than 40 ppm. As the acceptable water concentration for cyclic siloxanes may be on the order of less than 10 ppm FTIR could not support such a measurement.

Gas Chromatography GC another commonly used analytical technique reliably and accurately detects concentrations of volatile organics to levels of less than 5 ppm by a vapor phase substrate separation process in a capillary column. However GC columns available for measurement of trace water fail to meet the same detection standards as for organic molecules rendering the technique unacceptable for trace water measurements in cyclosiloxanes.

Accordingly there is a need for an analytical method which allows for the determination of trace water in cyclosiloxane materials.

Therefore it is one objective of the present invention to develop an analytical technique for the measurement of trace water in cyclosiloxane materials.

It is a further objective of the present invention to develop an analytical technique for the accurate and precise measurement of trace water in cyclosiloxane materials having detection limits as low as 1 ppm.

It is a further objective of the present invention to develop a method for the production of super dry cyclosiloxanes which includes a means by which to efficiently and accurately measure the water content of the super dry cyclic siloxane material.

The present invention relates to the accurate and precise measurement of water concentration in chemical materials requiring trace water analysis. More specifically the present invention relates to the measurement of trace water concentration in siloxane and cyclosiloxane compounds by measuring an organic derivative of water by gas chromatography.

The ensuing discussion relating primarily to cyclosiloxanes should therefore be understood to encompass all such materials solids liquids and gases where trace water analysis is required and or necessary including but not limited to chemicals for semiconductor manufacturing ion implantation manufacture of flat panel displays medical treatment water treatment emergency breathing equipment welding operations space based applications involving delivery of liquids and gases pharmaceutical industry lubricating oil industry foodstuff industry etc.

Other aspects features and embodiments of the invention will be more fully apparent from the ensuing disclosure and appended claims.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 015 326 entitled Method for Removal of Impurities in Cyclic Siloxanes Useful as Precursors for Low Dielectric Constant Thin Films filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Dec. 13 2001 and issued Sep. 19 2006 as U.S. Pat. No. 7 108 771 is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Although described hereinafter primarily in reference to cyclosiloxanes it will be appreciated that the method of the invention is not thus limited but rather is broadly applicable to the analysis of other materials and mixtures as well as to other chemical reagents where trace water analysis is necessary. The present invention is applicable to the manufacturing and use of materials including liquids solids and gases from all disciplines of technology where trace water analysis is required and or necessary including but not limited to chemicals for semiconductor manufacturing ion implantation manufacture of flat panel displays medical treatment water treatment emergency breathing equipment welding operations space based applications involving delivery of liquids and gases pharmaceutical applications foodstuff industry lubricating oil industry etc.

The present invention is not limited but rather is broadly applicable to the analysis of chemical reagents siloxane materials and mixtures of the foregoing where trace water analysis is required as well as to chemical reagents where trace water analysis is not measurable by Karl Fischer titration and other methods. The ensuing discussion relating to cyclosiloxanes should therefore be understood to encompass all such other materials as disclosed hereinabove.

The present invention further relates to the accurate and precise measurement of water concentration in chemical reagents. More specifically the present invention relates to the measurement of trace water concentration in chemical reagents by measuring a water derivative of an organic compound by gas chromatography.

In one embodiment the invention relates to a process for measuring water concentration in chemical reagents to levels

In one embodiment the present invention relates to a process for the measurement of trace water concentration in chemical reagents comprising same such process comprising the steps of 

In a further embodiment the present invention provides a process for measuring the concentration of water in cyclosiloxane materials suitable for semiconductor device manufacturing applications in which the cyclosiloxane material is useful as a precursor for producing porous low dielectric constant SiO and SiCOH thin films of correspondingly high purity. Preferably the process of the instant invention is useful for measuring water concentration in cyclosiloxane compounds to levels

In a further embodiment the present invention relates to a process for the measurement of trace water concentration in cyclosiloxane compounds comprising 

Hexafluoroacetone HFA is a gas at room temperature and may be bubbled directly into a sample or the HFA may be injected into a sample by means of a gas tight syringe. The amount of hexafluoroacetone used should be in stoichiometric excess of the approximate concentration of water in the chemical reagent and such amount is readily determined by one skilled in the art. The hexafluoroacetone will react stoichiometrically with water 1 1 while excess hexafluoroacetone which eludes separately and distinctly from the water derivative of the hexafluoroacetone ensures that all water molecules in the sample to be measured are converted to the water derivative of the HFA.

In a preferred embodiment HFA is injected by means of a gas tight syringe into a sample comprising at least a cyclosiloxane compound and trace water. The amount of hexafluoroacetone used is in stoichiometric excess of the approximate concentration of water in the chemical reagent.

In the CVD process a precursor is delivered to a CVD reactor in vapor form. In the case of solids and liquids this requires heating of the delivery lines CVD chamber and substrate. It is speculated that cyclosiloxanes particularly TMCTS prematurely polymerize in the heated delivery lines due to the presence of trace water in the raw cyclosiloxane material through a ring opening mechanism. Trace acids and or bases which may be present in the CVD process further accelerate the ring opening mechanism.

In current CVD processes COand ammonia NH are used as reactant gases when depositing low dielectric thin films from cyclosiloxanes particularly TMCTS. If the TMCTS is wet CObecomes HCO which is a fairly strong acid and ammonia becomes NHOH which is a fairly strong base. As acids and bases promote TMCTS polymerization in the delivery tubes of the CVD apparatus leading to delivery line plugging problems it is necessary to use dry TMCTS. Accordingly the instant invention provides a much needed process for accurately measuring the water concentration in cyclosiloxane materials. See applicants currently pending application Ser. No. 10 015 326 entitled Method for Removal of Impurities in Cyclic Siloxanes Useful as Precursors for Low Dielectric Constant Thin Films 

To determine whether water played a significant role in the polymerization of the TMCTS the inventors of the instant invention developed a control experiment using H NMR to study such affects. shows a H NMR spectrum of a commercial sample of raw TMCTS in CDhaving a water content of approximately 125 ppm. The resonance of Si H proton and CHprotons are shown at 4.98 and 0.165 ppm respectively. shows by H NMR spectroscopy the effect of heating the same sample as in to 140 C. for 20 hours. The sample became visually viscous and partially polymerized as shown by H shifts in the Si H peak from 4.98 to 5.04 and the CHpeak from 0.165 to 0.255. shows significant polymerization of the TMCTS with 125 ppm water. The sample used in was distilled at 140 C. for 20 hours. As shown by a very small peak less than 5 at the position of the polymer resonances indicates formation of the polymer. Thus indicating the need for a highly efficient method for removing water from cyclosiloxane materials as well as the need for an analytical technique for measuring trace water concentrations. shows a H NMR spectrum of a TMCTS sample after drying over CaH followed by distillation according to one embodiment of the present invention. The sample having approximately 10 ppm of water shows no signs of polymerization.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 015 326 entitled Method for Removal of Impurities in Cyclic Siloxanes Useful as Precursors for Low Dielectric Constant Thin Films filed on Dec. 13 2001 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety discloses a novel method of purifying siloxanes particularly cyclosiloxanes having impurity levels from 1 to 20 ppm. As cyclosiloxanes are foreseen by the semiconductor industry as viable candidates for the development and implementation of new low dielectric constant materials it is imperative that methods are available to purify and characterize such materials.

Gas chromatography GC is a standard technique used in many laboratories and industrial facilities and is useful in analyzing mixtures of volatile substances. Gas chromatographs may be used alone with various detectors such as flame ionization detector thermionic emission detector photo ionization detector electron capture detector ECD and others or with a mass spectrometer as a detector. In such applications a gas chromatography GC column separates sample components from a sample mixture. In such an application the gas chromatography GC column separates the sample components from the sample mixture and the mass spectrometer analyzes and quantifies the sample components.

By converting water to a volatile organic compound through derivatization the inventors of the instant invention have developed an accurate and precise means by which to measure water in cyclosiloxane materials to levels as low as 1 ppm.

In a further embodiment the present invention relates to an analytical technique for the accurate and precise measurement of trace water in cyclosiloxane materials comprising 

In one embodiment the cyclosiloxane material comprises the formula R R Si O wherein each of R and R is same or different and independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen C Calkyl C Calkoxy C Calkene C Calkyne and C Ccarboxyl and n is from 2 to 8. In a preferred embodiment the cyclosiloxane is selected from the group consisting of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes POSS octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane OMCTS more specifically 1 1 3 3 5 5 7 7 octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane OMCTS hexamethylcyclotetra siloxane HMCTS more specifically 1 1 3 5 5 7 hexamethylcyclotetrasiloxane HMCTS tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane TMCTS more specifically 1 3 5 7 tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane TMCTS and mixtures thereof. In the most preferred embodiment the cyclosiloxane material is 1 3 5 7 tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane TMCTS .

The organic molecule selected for derivatization should have certain characteristics including but not limited to 

In one embodiment the organic molecule is selected from the group consisting of hexafluoracetylacetone Hhfac fluorocarboxylic acids and hexafluoroacetone. Preferably the organic molecule is hexafluoracetone.

In a further embodiment the present invention relates to a process for the measurement of trace water concentration in tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane TMCTS wherein said process comprises the steps of 

Hexafluoroacetone reacts rapidly and quantitatively with water at room temperature according to the following equation CF CO HO CF C OH 3 

The conditions for the various parameters for the gas chromatograph and other related ancillaries as used in the instant invention with regard to such parameter as column specifications column temperature sample size detector temperature injector temperature internal standard carrier gas flow and carrier gas type are readily determined by skilled artisans in analytical chemistry. In one embodiment the conditions for gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer include but are not limited to 

In one embodiment the injector temperature of the gas chromatograph is set to 100 C. to prevent decomposition of the water derivative of the hexafluoroacetone back to water and HFA.

The derivatization and measurement steps of the instant invention may be carried out at any time during the purification process of a cyclosiloxane material. However most preferably the derivatization and trace water measurement steps are carried out after the cyclosiloxane material has been purified at least once. Methods useful in purifying cyclosiloxane compounds to levels acceptable by the semiconductor industry include the methods outlined in applicants pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 015 326 entitled Method for Removal of Impurities in Cyclic Siloxanes Useful as Precursors for Low Dielectric Constant Thin Films filed on Dec. 13 2001 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Purification methods include but are not limited to distillation azeotropic distillation use of absorbent materials which remove water either physically or chemically via adsorption or reaction filtration extraction and combinations of the foregoing.

In a still further aspect the present invention relates to a method for production of a super dry cyclosiloxane precursor material comprising 

As used herein an adsorbent and or drying agent is defined as a substance that absorbs water and or other impurities. Drying agents and or adsorbents are grouped into two major classes chemically acting and physically acting drying agents.

Chemically acting drying agents are substances that bind water in the form of crystallization and may be regenerated by warming. Examples of these types of drying agents are calcium chloride sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate. The second subdivision of chemically acting drying agents is substances that react with water. Regeneration of these drying agents is not possible since the drying agent has undergone a chemical change. Examples of these types of drying agents are phosphorus pentoxide metals and metal hydrides such as calcium hydride and HFA.

Physically acting drying agents are substances that adsorb water and or other impurities on the surface and in the pores of the drying agent. These drying agents can be regenerated by warming or applying a vacuum. Examples of these types of drying agents are desiccant silica gel molecular sieves activated carbon and aluminum oxide.

The adsorbent bed material used in the purification process of the instant invention may comprise one of many adsorbents and or drying agents and or mixtures thereof having affinity for water and or at least one acidic impurity. Such adsorbents are readily known to those skilled in the art. For example the adsorbent may comprise activated carbon adsorbent beads or powder having an average particle size of from about 30 to 50 m with a pore size distribution of from about 10 to 50 nm. The drying agent may comprise a liquid or a gaseous material such as HFA. Further the adsorbent bed material may comprise molecular sieves having a particle size distribution from about 100 to 125 m and a pore size distribution from about 10 to 50 nm. Still further the adsorbent bed material may comprise calcium hydride or calcium oxide etc. In a preferred embodiment the adsorbent is selected from calcium oxide and calcium hydride.

In one embodiment the adsorbent bed material may comprise a combination or series of adsorbents and or drying agents. For example the cyclosiloxane precursor may first contact a drying agent such as calcium hydride to adsorb water molecules and separately contact a carbon adsorbent material for adsorption of an acidic impurity. As a second example the adsorbent bed material may comprise a combination of both calcium hydride and carbon adsorbent to remove both water and acidic impurity in a single step.

The amount of adsorbent used is dependent on the concentration of water and optionally other impurities present in the cyclosiloxane precursor material to be purified and the capacity of the adsorbent bed material. In one embodiment the adsorbent may be useful in reducing water levels to 

The adsorbent bed material may be placed in a distillation flask or in a separate column so long as the cyclosiloxane to be purified contacts the adsorbent bed material for a period of time sufficient to remove at least a portion of the impurity from the cyclosiloxane precursor. In one embodiment the cyclosiloxane precursor contacts the adsorbent bed material from about 1 minute to about 10 hours more preferably from about 30 minutes to 2 hours.

As used herein the term azeotrope is defined as a constant boiling mixture having a fixed composition which cannot be altered by normal distillation. The azeotropic component employed in the invention should form an azeotrope with water. Azeotropic components useful in the purification step of the instant invention include but are not limited to benzene ethanol 2 propanol butyl acetate phenol chloroform methyl acrylate isopropyl formate isopropyl acetate cyclohexane di iso propyl ether toluene and n heptane. A particularly preferred azeotropic component useful in the present invention is benzene which forms an azeotrope with water at 69.4 C.

In a further embodiment the present invention relates to a real time gas chromatography mass spectrometry method of analyzing trace water in cyclosiloxane precursors. A sampling valve distributes an aliquot of cyclosiloxane from a reaction vessel or other containment system and introduces the cyclosiloxane aliquot into a mixing chamber where HFA and a GC standard are combined and mixed aliquot to form a sample for GC analysis. The sample contains at least the cyclosiloxane unreacted HFA water derivatized HFA and standard. An aliquot of the sample is transferred by carrier gas to a micro accumulator where it is delivered to the gas chromatography column for separation of the sample into sample components and transport of the sample components to a mass spectrometer for trace water detection and analysis or testing in real time.

The features aspects and advantages of the present invention are further shown with reference to the following non limiting example relating to the invention.

Three analytical samples including an analytical standard all containing water were measured using the water derivative of hexafluoroacetone method HFA . For purposes of method validation the same samples were also measured using the Karl Fischer titration method of water analysis. As shown by the results in Table 1 below the HFA method produced water measurements relatively similar to the Karl Fischer water titration method. With respect to the analytical standard for water the HFA method measured the water content with a higher accuracy than did the Karl Fischer water analysis method.

To determine the precision of the HFA method of water analysis an analytical standard of 100 ppm water is measured five times. Table 2 shows the results of the water concentration measurement as well as the mean and the mean error.

To confirm the precision of the HFA method of water analysis two samples from a single batch of purified tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane TMCTS were measured five times each using the water derivative of hexafluoroacetone method of the instant invention. Table 3 shows the results of the water concentration measurement as well as the mean and the mean error for both samples.
