The present invention relates in general to a liquid metal cooled fast reactor and more particularly to a nuclear fuel assembly and a core for a liquid metal cooled fast reactor in which the nuclear fuel assembly has nuclear fuel rods having different cladding thicknesses in reactor core regions includes a nuclear fuel assembly in an inner reactor core region a nuclear fuel assembly in a middle reactor core region which surrounds the nuclear fuel assembly of the inner reactor core region and a nuclear fuel assembly in an outer reactor core region which surrounds the nuclear fuel assembly of the middle reactor core region and is installed in a hexagonal duct with nuclear fuel materials surrounded by respective claddings and in which the claddings of a nuclear fuel rod in the inner reactor core region a nuclear fuel rod in the middle reactor core region and a nuclear fuel rod in the outer reactor core region are formed at different thicknesses thereby being able to effectively flatten power distribution using a single enrichment nuclear fuel in the liquid metal cooled fast reactor.

Growing interest has recently been taken in the development of fourth generation nuclear reactors which alleviate international resistance to nuclear proliferation i.e. the spread of nuclear weapons . Among them it has been reported that a sodium cooled fast reactor has entered the step just before commercialization because the technology thereof has been considerably developed.

Thus in several countries including the USA Japan and Russia nuclear reactor design concepts that obviate a blanket and use a single enrichment nuclear fuel in order to alleviate resistance to the spread of liquid metal nuclear reactors have been suggested.

Each blanket contains depleted uranium or natural uranium and is characterized by the production of nuclear grade plutonium when loaded into a reactor core.

However since the blanket increases the breeding ratio of nuclear fuel the obviation of the blanket has an advantage in that it basically blocks the production of nuclear grade plutonium thus alleviating resistance based on fears of nuclear proliferation but has a disadvantage in that it has a lower breeding ratio.

The use of the single enrichment nuclear fuel maintains a constant breeding ratio in each reactor core region and thus limits the frequency of changes in power distribution over time.

Accordingly the single enrichment nuclear fuel facilitates the design of an orifice required for flow distribution.

In Korea a sodium cooled reactor of 600 MWe has already been designed thus both obviating the blankets and using the single enrichment nuclear fuel. In a core of the sodium cooled reactor in order to flatten the power distribution using the single enrichment nuclear fuel a non nuclear fuel rod such as a B4C rod a ZrH2 rod or a vacancy rod has been used for a nuclear fuel assembly.

However the design of such a nuclear fuel assembly is complicated compared to that of a known nuclear fuel assembly. When the B4C or ZrH2 rod is irradiated at high temperature the soundness of this non nuclear fuel rod containing this compound becomes a problem.

Particularly in the case of the ZrH2 rod because hydrogen is emitted at a high temperature of 550 C. the soundness of cladding has become a known problem.

The general concept of a high capacity sodium cooled fast reactor is based on the use of the blankets and variation of fuel enrichment in each reactor core region in order to flatten power distribution. In the case where the single enrichment nuclear fuel is used a method of properly disposing the blankets in the middle of the reactor core as well as in the reactor core has been used.

In a lead cooled fast reactor BREST which has recently been proposed in Russia a method of varying the outer diameter of the nuclear fuel rod in each reactor core region instead of avoiding variation in fuel enrichment has been adopted. Further an attempt has been made to alleviate resistance to nuclear proliferation by obviating the blanket.

However with this method it is difficult to maintain the size of the nuclear fuel assembly consistent due to the difference between the outer diameters of the nuclear fuel rods when applied to the case of using a sodium cooled reactor particularly a duct and a wire wrap.

The Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute JNC has proposed a method of maintaining both the outer diameter of the nuclear fuel rod and the thickness of the cladding uniform and of varying the content of zirconium Zr in the nuclear fuel surrounded by the cladding in each reactor core region.

Regarding this method however the predominant opinion is that the performance and production of the nuclear fuel become a problem.

The reason is as follows. According to results released from the US Argonne National Laboratory the optimal content of Zr is generally 10 wt and when the content of Zr is less than 10 wt eutectic and melting temperatures of a metal fuel do not become sufficiently high and re distribution of elements may create a region where the content of Zr is abruptly reduced. In contrast when the content of Zr is more than 10 wt the melting temperature of a fuel core becomes higher than that of a quartz tube when the nuclear fuel is produced.

JNC has also proposed a method of simultaneously varying the content of Zr in each reactor core region and adjusting the smear density of the metal fuel.

However according to a study on the smear density of the metal fuel reported by US Argonne National Laboratory the optimal smear density of the metal fuel is 75 TD and when it is higher than this value the soundness of the nuclear fuel become a problem.

According to the design concepts of an encapsulated nuclear heat source ENHS a small size ultra long cycle lead cooled fast reactor which is being studied under the control of California State University at Berkeley in the USA an attempt has been made to maintain the size and components of the nuclear fuel rod uniform in all of the reactor core regions and to adjust the power distribution by increasing the area of a non nuclear fuel region in the middle of the fuel core.

In this case however it is found that the area of the non nuclear fuel region in the middle of the fuel core is increased such that the peak power factor is maintained less than 1.5 and thus the breeding ratio is considerably reduced.

According to the ENHS design concepts another method of maintaining the design specification and components of each nuclear fuel rod in each reactor core region uniform and of varying only the distance between the nuclear fuel rods has been released.

This method however is suitable for a small size reactor core that makes no use of a duct and a wire wrap but not for a large size reactor core which uses the duct and the wire wrap.

Accordingly the present invention has been made in an effort to solve the problems occurring in the related art and an object of the present invention is to provide a nuclear fuel assembly having nuclear fuel rods of different cladding thicknesses in reactor core regions in a liquid metal cooled fast reactor in which the nuclear fuel assembly has nuclear fuel rods each of which has a cladding thicknesses varied in each reactor core region and in which claddings of the nuclear fuel rod in an inner reactor core region the nuclear fuel rod in a middle reactor core region and the nuclear fuel rod in an outer reactor core region are formed at different thicknesses without using any non nuclear fuel rods thereby being able to effectively flatten power distribution using a single enrichment nuclear fuel in the liquid metal cooled fast reactor.

In order to achieve the above object according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a liquid metal cooled fast reactor in which claddings of a nuclear fuel rod in an inner reactor core region a nuclear fuel rod in a middle reactor core region and a nuclear fuel rod in an outer reactor core region are formed at different thicknesses thereby being able to effectively flatten power distribution using a single enrichment nuclear fuel.

According to the present invention the claddings of the nuclear fuel rods in the respective reactor core region of the liquid metal cooled fast reactor are formed at different thicknesses and more particularly the thicknesses of the claddings are formed to be decreased in the order of the inner middle and outer reactor core regions and thus the diameters of the nuclear fuel materials are formed to be increased in the order of the inner middle and outer reactor core regions so that the present invention can flatten the power distribution by simplifying the method of realizing a single enrichment improve the soundness of the nuclear fuel assembly by simplifying the design of the nuclear fuel assembly and the soundness of each nuclear fuel rod thus resulting in improved economy.

According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a liquid metal cooled fast reactor in which claddings of a nuclear fuel rod in an inner reactor core region a nuclear fuel rod in a middle reactor core region and a nuclear fuel rod in an outer reactor core region are formed at different thicknesses thereby being able to effectively flatten power distribution using a single enrichment nuclear fuel.

The nuclear fuel material portion of the nuclear fuel rod in the inner reactor core region has a diameter of 6.03 MM.

The nuclear fuel material portion of the nuclear fuel rod in the middle reactor core region has a diameter of 6.51 mm.

The nuclear fuel material portion of the nuclear fuel rod in the outer reactor core region has a diameter of 6.77 mm.

Reference will now be made in greater detail to exemplary embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.

At this time the nuclear fuel rods are installed in a hexagonal duct and sodium coolant is provided between the ducts .

The duct has a thickness of 3.7 mm the distance between the outer faces of the duct is 18.31 cm and the distance between the inner faces of the duct is 17.57 cm see .

A sodium region between the ducts has a thickness of 4 mm and a pitch of the nuclear fuel assembly is 18.71 cm see .

The duct makes uniform the flow resistance of all channels therein and in a bundle of the nuclear fuel rods mitigates a by pass phenomenon in which the sodium coolant flows along a path having low flow resistance and forces the sodium coolant to flow around all of the nuclear fuel rods in the bundle of the nuclear fuel rods such that the sodium coolant uniformly flows. Thereby the duct of the nuclear fuel assembly makes it possible to function as an orifice.

Further the duct structurally supports the bundle of nuclear fuel rods and nuclear fuel rods form a hexagonal bundle in a triangular arrangement in the duct . Each nuclear fuel rod is mounted on a mounting rail through mechanical connection.

The nose piece supports the lower portion of the nuclear fuel assembly and provides an inlet for the sodium coolant.

When the nuclear fuel rods are arranged in a triangular shape in the duct a wire wrap is used to maintain an interval between the nuclear fuel rod and the nuclear fuel rod .

The wire wrap is bonded and welded to upper and lower end plugs at opposite ends of each nuclear fuel rod so as to be wound around each nuclear fuel rod at regular intervals thereby functioning to maintain the interval between the nuclear fuel rods and the interval between the nuclear fuel rods and the duct and increase the flow mixture of the sodium coolant.

The wire wrap has a diameter of 1.4 mm and each nuclear fuel rod has an outer diameter of 9.0 mm. Further the ratio of the pitch P of a grid and the diameter D of each nuclear fuel rod is 1.1667 see .

Each nuclear fuel rod has a shielding region for the bottom end cap at a lower end thereof and for a Mod. HT9 cladding and the shielding region has a length of 111.76 cm.

The upper side of the shielding region is a nuclear fuel region the length of which is 100 cm. The nuclear fuel material in the nuclear fuel region is surrounded by a cladding and a sodium bonding agent is disposed between the nuclear fuel material and the cladding.

Sodium of the sodium bond has good compatibility with other material as well as good thermal conductivity and thus serves to maintain low temperature distribution of the nuclear fuel core.

Among the sodium that is present between the nuclear fuel material and the cladding while the nuclear fuel is burnt some penetrates the nuclear fuel material due to the expansion of the nuclear fuel material and the rest moves in an upward direction.

Each nuclear fuel rod has a gas plenum region at the upper portion thereof which holds gas generated by nuclear fission and lowers the pressure in a cladding tube.

The gas generated from the nuclear fuel by nuclear fission goes up to the gas plenum region together with the sodium.

The gas plenum region has a length of 156.25 cm. The upper side of the gas plenum region is an upper end plug the length of which is 2.54 cm. Thus the total length of each nuclear fuel rod is 370.55 cm see .

As illustrated in the reactor core region having the nuclear fuel is divided into three regions inner middle and outer.

The inner middle and outer reactor core regions have 114 78 and 138 nuclear fuel rods respectively which constitute the nuclear fuel assembly . 72 reflector assemblies are disposed at the outer boundary of the reactor core region having the nuclear fuel and 78 B4C shield assemblies 114 in vessel storage units IVSs and 90 shield assemblies are disposed outside the reflector assemblies in that order.

As illustrated at this time the reactor core completely obviates a blanket assembly in order to alleviate resistance based on fears of nuclear proliferation.

Among the reactor core regions the inner reactor core region constitutes a nuclear fuel assembly the middle reactor core region surrounding the nuclear fuel assembly of the inner reactor core region constitutes a nuclear fuel assembly and the outer reactor core region surrounding the nuclear fuel assembly of the middle reactor core region constitutes a nuclear fuel assembly . In the nuclear fuel assembly of the liquid metal cooled fast reactor which is installed in the hexagonal duct with the nuclear fuel materials and surrounded by the claddings and the claddings and of the nuclear fuel rod in the inner reactor core region the nuclear fuel rod in the middle reactor core region and the nuclear fuel rod in the outer reactor core region are formed at different thicknesses.

In this manner by forming the claddings and of the nuclear fuel rods and in the reactor core regions at different thicknesses the power distribution can be flattened.

Here the thickness of the cladding of the nuclear fuel rod in the inner reactor core region is most preferably 1.02 mm. The thickness of the cladding of the nuclear fuel rod in the middle reactor core region is most preferably 0.74 mm. The thickness of the cladding of the nuclear fuel rod in the outer reactor core region is most preferably 0.59 mm.

However the outer diameters of the nuclear fuel rods and are equally maintained in order to equally maintain areas of the channels in all reactor core regions.

Further the nuclear fuel makes use of an ordinary TRU U 10Zr metal fuel and the smear density of the metal fuel is 75 TD and is maintained consistent in all of the reactor core regions.

To the end the diameter of the nuclear fuel material of the nuclear fuel rod in the inner reactor core region is most preferably 6.03 mm. The diameter of the nuclear fuel material of the nuclear fuel rod in the middle reactor core region is most preferably 6.51 mm. The diameter of the nuclear fuel material of the nuclear fuel rod in the outer reactor core region is most preferably 6.77 mm.

In other words the main feature of the present invention is that in order to flatten the power distribution using the single enrichment nuclear fuel the cladding of the nuclear fuel rod in the inner reactor core region is thickest whereas the cladding of the nuclear fuel rod in the outer reactor core region is thinnest.

Thus the liquid metal cooled fast reactor having the nuclear fuel assembly in accordance with the present invention can secure good reactor core performance and can simultaneously flatten power distribution using the single enrichment nuclear fuel.

In the drawings and specification typical exemplary embodiments of the invention have been disclosed and although specific terms are employed they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for the purposes of limitation the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims.

As described above according to the present invention the claddings of the nuclear fuel rods in the respective reactor core region of the liquid metal cooled fast reactor are formed at different thickness and more particularly the thicknesses of the claddings are formed so as to decrease in the order of the inner middle and outer reactor core regions and the diameters of the nuclear fuel materials are formed so as to increase in the order of the inner middle and outer reactor core regions so that the power distribution can be flattened by simplifying the method of realizing single enrichment so that the soundness of the nuclear fuel assembly and the soundness of each nuclear fuel rod can be improved by simplifying the design of the nuclear fuel assembly and so that the improvement of economy can be realized.
