The present invention relates to the field of surface acoustic wave SAW devices and specifically to improvements to in their manufacturing which then provides additional applications for use.

Acoustic wave sensors use a detection arrangement that is based on perturbations to mechanical or acoustic waves. As an acoustic wave propagates through or on the surface of the acoustive wave sensor material any changes to the physical or chemical characteristics of the wave path may affect the velocity and or amplitude of the acoustic wave. These changes may be correlated to the corresponding physical chemical or biological quantities being measured to provide sensing.

There may be various biological and chemical sensors using fiber optics chemical interactions and various fluorescence approaches. Such sensors may however have various weaknesses such as for example low sensitivity selectivity or an inability to be hybridized or integrated into sensing chip technology. Acoustic wave AW sensors however may be better suited for use in biological and chemical detection. As discussed in D. S. Ballantine R. M. White S. J. Martin A. J. Ricco E. T. Zellers G. C. Frye H. Wohltjen Acoustic Wave Sensor Theory Design and Physico Chemical Applications Academic Press 1997 acoustic wave sensors may use piezoelectric crystals which may allow transduction between electrical and acoustic energies. The AW sensor may use piezoelectric material to convert a high frequency signal into an acoustic wave and the higher frequency may enable the sensor to be more sensitive to surface perturbations.

Piezoelectric materials used for acoustic wave sensors may include quartz SiO lithium niobate LiNbO zinc oxide ZnO and others. Each of these materials may possess specific advantages and disadvantages which may relate to for example cost temperature dependence attenuation and propagation velocity. Such materials may however have varying transverse acoustic wave velocities low electromechanical coupling coefficients non linear temperature coefficients and may react chemically with the environment.

CMOS is short for complementary metal oxide semiconductor. Pronounced see moss CMOS is a widely used type of semiconductor. CMOS semiconductors use both NMOS negative polarity and PMOS positive polarity circuits. Since only one of the circuit types is on at any given time CMOS chips require less power than chips using just one type of transistor. This makes them particularly attractive for use in battery powered devices such as portable computers. Personal computers also contain a small amount of battery powered CMOS memory to hold the date time and system setup parameters.

SAW surface acoustic wave devices are widely used as electronic filters delay lines resonators in today s communication systems. Although telecommunication industry is the largest user of these devices SAW based sensors have many attractive features to be explored for emerging technologies in automotive torque pressure medical biosensor and commercial vapor gas humidity applications.

Surface acoustic waves both Rayleigh and pseudo SAW are generated at the free surface of a piezoelectric material. An application of a varying voltage to the metal IDT interdigital transducer generates the acoustic wave on the input side. In the basic configuration there is an input IDT and an output IDT. The acoustic wave generated by the input IDT travels through the region called the delay line and reaches the output IDT where the mechanical displacements due to the acoustic waves create a voltage difference between the output IDT fingers. One of the most widely used and interesting sensing mechanism that acoustic wave sensors employ is mass loading. Prominent applications are in film thickness monitoring gas liquid phase chemical sensing and biosensing. The delay lines of SAW devices are coated with some bio chemical coating which selectively reacts with the entity under analysis. This interaction produces a shift in the resonant frequency of the SAW device. By measuring this shift in frequency domain a detailed analysis of the entity being sensed can be completed. depicts the basic principle of SAW based bio chemical sensors employing the mass loading scheme.

Using a combination of IC compatible technologies such as Si micromachining thin film deposition bio chemical layer growth integrated electronics smart structures and systems can be realized. Considering the advantages that CMOS technology provides along with the ever developing CMOS compatible MEMS processes the SAW technology performance can be improved significantly. Therefore an array of SAW delay lines were designed and fabricated through a regular CMOS process sequence characterized and post processed using widely used MEMS techniques.

The mass sensitivities of different acoustic devices are related to structure geometry resonant center frequency and electromechanical coupling. In order to explore all of these design parameters an array of SAW devices were designed. depicts the important dimensions of the devices that were fabricated. Four devices on the dies were tested with finger width of 2.40 m finger spacing of 2.40 m and a period of 9.60 m. The apertures were picked to be 54.80 m device 1 and 2 502.80 m and 244.80 m. 24 and 32 finger pairs were used with delay line lengths of 288 m and 384 m. Note that all of these devices were designed on the same die which is a 2.2 mm by 2.2 mm tiny chip. The design was fabricated in AMI 1.5 m 2 metal 2 poly process through MOSIS. In order to comply with the design rules for this technology the minimum finger spacing for the IDTs is limited to 2.4 m. This limitation is due to the minimum metal to metal spacing for the aforementioned technology.

The most important specification for SAW device design is the center frequency which is determined by the period of the IDT fingers and the acoustic velocity of the piezoelectric material.

The governing equation that determines the operation frequency is SAW 1 the wavelength at fc determined by the periodicity of the IDT. fc the center frequency of the device vSAW the velocity of the SAW

Based on tabulated data and calculations for the corresponding design dimensions vSAW for ZnO is 3820 m s. This translates into a center frequency of 3820 m s 9.6 m 397.916 MHz 3 

The conventional SAW devices are typically built by depositing a piezoelectric material quartz lithium tantalite lithium niobate zinc oxide on a substrate and patterning the IDTs on top of the piezoelectric film as depicted in . This sequence of fabrication does not comply with any commercially available CMOS process as it requires an extra step to deposit the piezoelectric material. It has been reported that enhanced electromechanical coupling is theoretically possible using piezoelectric films overlaying interdigital metal electrodes. Therefore IDT under the piezoelectric material idea is employed for this work. By depositing the piezoelectric material on top of the IDTs as a post processing step the CMOS process is not disturbed.

For device stability as a function of temperature it is essential that the temperature coefficient of delay TCD be as small as possible. The slope of the TCD as a function of temperature for SAW substrates is mainly negative so that an increase in temperature will cause a downward shift in IDT center frequency and vice versa. Due to this strong temperature dependence of the device performance and for precise control of the temperature to study the effects of temperature on the mass sensitive layer and the analyte of interest a novel heater design is developed. For the heater elements n well was picked as the resistive layer. The n well layer has a TCR of 0.5 0.75 K which is the highest among various CMOS process layers. Moreover n well provides an embedded heater structure that can directly control the temperature of the substrate and the mass sensitive area without causing any disturbance on the SAW delay line path or the IDT finger design as in the case of other candidate layers e.g. polysilicon metal for resistive heating.

The major distortions in the transfer characteristics of SAW devices occur due to interference of the reflected waves and the triple transit effect. In Rayleigh wave devices acoustic absorbers were shown to be effective against the reflections. They consist of soft materials located on the surface at the edges of the device. In order to investigate the performance of the SiO2 in reflecting or attenuating acoustic waves an absorber structure was designed from stacking CMOS layers of metal1 metal2 and polysilicon. By stacking these dummy strips a surface higher than the IDT level was created which is investigated for attenuating or reflecting the acoustic waves. depicts the side view of the design after CMOS process was completed and before any post processing was carried out.

After the chips are fabricated they are covered with the overglass protection and the dielectrics SiO2 over and underneath the metal and poly layers. The first step in the fabrication is RIE Reactive Ion Etch . This step has been developed examined and characterized previously. Note that AMI 1.5 m process contains only two metal layers one of which is already being used as IDTs in this run and the second metal layer will be used in the absorber structures for two main purposes. 1 To increase the height of the absorber compared to the height of the IDTs 2 To act as a mask layer that protects the oxide which is built up under this layer. The RIE etches the dielectric that is not covered with aluminum including field oxide overglass and intermetal dielectrics. The dies that were fabricated through MOSIS were RIE etched through MEMS Exchange. The etching was carried out in a Plasma Therm 72 RIE equipment under 40 mTorr pressure.

The etch rate is 250 min. The depth of the total oxide removed by the etch process is 1.5 m. After the RIE step is completed three major areas are defined on the surface. The absorbers the IDTS both of which are expected to retain their dielectric layers underneath and exposed Si which lay between the IDTs and the area that will define the delay line. FIG. .. depicts the side view of the die after the RIE and FIG. .. is an SEM of the device after RIE.

ZnO finds wide applications in SAW devices due to its strong piezoelectric effect among non ferroelectric materials. A variety of deposition techniques were used for the growth of ZnO on various substrates. Among them sputtering is considered to be the most favorable one as it is possible to obtain well oriented and uniform ZnO films. Therefore RF magnetron sputtering was the choice of deposition in our work.

By maskless sputtering from the front the ZnO covers the entire surface including the IDT fingers and the exposed Si. This inevitably creates bulks of ZnO layers between the IDT fingers. FIG. .shows the side view of the die after the ZnO deposition. Sputter deposition of zinc oxide shows superior properties over other deposition methods but the quality of the sputtered film and the growth constitutes a major interest in SAW related applications. The ZnO was deposited on the previously etched dies through MEMS Exchange. The targeted thickness was 3.0 m and the measured film thickness variation was 13.1. Argon and oxygen were used with a set up time of 180 min in an MRC Sputter at 200 C.

The surface morphology roughness and the crystal orientation of the sputtered ZnO are subject of interest. Therefore a thorough characterization of the sputtered films is required. The ZnO covered samples are analyzed for the crystal orientation in Scintag XRD 1000. For comparative analysis 2 i scans of a dummy die Si ZnO and a patterned die Si SiO2 Al ZnO were carried out. As it can be seen from FIG. . the ZnO shows its peak at 2 i 

a peak at 2 i 73 which corresponds to its listed peak at 2 i 72.560 for 004 . In order to obtain information regarding the surface roughness and grain size JOEL High Vacuum Integrated STM AFM JSPM 5200 was utilized. The multilayered Si SiO2 Al ZnO dies were characterized. FIG. .shows the results.

After the ZnO deposition the entire die is covered with the sputtered ZnO. In order to access the pads for bonding a last step of lithography and etching are required. The entire die area is 2.2 mm 2.2 mm and the pads are 100 m 100 m. A simple shadow mask idea was employed for the etching step. The mask was constructed by using a square Si piece of size 2 2 mm. The major problem encountered during the patterning was the photoresist build up on the edges of the die. Thickness measurements showed a 2 4 m photoresist buildup on the pad frame region when the thickness on the areas closer to the center of dies were measured to be 1 m. In order to completely remove the photoresist build up covering the pad frame a two step process was carried out. In the first step Shipley 1818 2 1 thinner was spun for 40 sec at 5000 rpm and the samples were exposed for 20 sec. Then a 2 min development in 5 1 Developer was applied. In the second step the same exposure time and development time was used to remove the excessive photoresist.

In general ZnO is attacked by all common acids and bases. In order to achieve smooth etch profiles and minimize the undercutting the etching process should be slowed. Therefore a very dilute solution of two acids was used. The most common acids that are listed in the literature are acetic hydrochloric and phosphoric acids. A solution of HPO CHCOOH DI HO with 1 1 150 was used for the etching.

2.6 m thick ZnO was etched completely in 4 min which translates into 648 min etch rate. Once the final step of post processing was completed the dies were bonded on a DIP 40 package for electrical testing. The major subjects of interest for performance analysis of SAW devices are the transmission coefficient and the reflection coefficient versus frequency. HP 8712ET 300 kHz 1300 MHz RF Network Analyzer was used for this purpose. A through cable calibration was carried out in order to measure and compensate for the losses and errors due to the connector and cable irregularities. S11 reflection and S21 transmission coefficient versus frequency is shown in FIGS. .and .respectively. The center frequency of the delay line agrees closely with the calculated value.

Thus a test chip that contains an array of SAW delay lines were designed and fabricated in AMI 1.5 m 2 metal 2 poly process. A unique three step maskless post processing sequence was developed. Complete characterization of the two etching steps and piezoelectric film was carried out. The transfer characteristics show a maximum transmission and minimum reflection at 392.5 MHz with an insertion loss of 4.83 dB. The 3 dB bandwidth was measured to be 19.25 MHz which agrees closely with the calculated value of 14.575 MHz. The results demonstrate that it is possible to design and fabricate SAW based sensors with comparable performance to conventional devices by using any commercially available CMOS technology.

CMOS fabrication technology is well established and requires that both n channel nMOS and p channel pMOS transistors be built on the same chip substrate. To accommodate both nMOS and pMOS devices special regions must be created in which the semiconductor type is opposite to the substrate type. These regions are called wells or tubs. A p well is created in an n type substrate or alternatively an n well is created in a p type substrate. In the simple n well CMOS fabrication technology presented the nMOS transistor is created in the p type substrate and the pMOS transistor is created in the n well which is built in into the p type substrate. In the twin tub CMOS technology additional tubs of the same type as the substrate can also be created for device optimization.

The simplified process sequence for the fabrication of CMOS integrated circuits on a p type silicon substrate starts with the creation of the n well regions for pMOS transistors by impurity implantation into the substrate. Then a thick oxide is grown in the regions surrounding the nMOS and pMOS active regions. The thin gate oxide is subsequently grown on the surface through thermal oxidation. These steps are followed by the creation of n and p regions source drain and channel stop implants and by final metallization creation of metal interconnects .

An integrated circuit IC is a circuit comprised of elements such as transistors resistors and capacitors fabricated in a single piece of semiconducting material usually silicon or gallium arsenide. As used herein integrated circuit not only refers to the common definition but also to highly integrated structures including for example 

1 multichip modules where several IC s and other circuit elements including molecular target probes may be combined compactly on a polymer quartz glass sliver ceramic or other substrates. In some cases one IC may be the substrate with other components such as photodiodes or LEDs mounted on it 2 Hybrid microcircuits where one or more IC s and other circuit elements are mounted on or several substrate s and 3 Other compact electromechanical arrangements of a circuit comprising primarily one but possibly more IC s and other electronic components and microelectromechanised systems MEMs . Surface Acoustic Wave Resonators

There has always been motivation to fully integrate the wireless transceiver. Surface acoustic wave SAW resonators have commonly been used as the local oscillator LO which is one of the basic building blocks of the RF receiver heterodyne architecture and is currently the major stumbling block for complete integration of RF receivers. Due to the structure of the SAW devices that require fabrication of metallized interdigital transducers on piezoelectric crystals the SAW resonators are difficult to implement in CMOS and are usually realized as discrete off chip components. Efforts to integrate surface acoustic wave filters on silicon substrates have been previously implemented by Visser Vellekoop and Zeijl while the monolithic integration of SAW devices on GaAs has been implemented by Baca of Sandia National Labs. The operating frequency of a surface acoustic wave resonator is determined by the periodic distance of its interdigitated transducer IDT fingers which are placed on piezoelectric material. Unlike bulk wave crystal resonators whose frequency of operation is determined by the thickness of the piezoelectric material surface acoustic wave resonators have a more area efficient structure since its frequency of operation is determined by the spacing between the IDTs and thus is only limited by the resolution of the fabrication process. The utilization of surface waves instead of bulk waves makes the process of integration with the present integrated circuit fabrication techniques more feasible since it eliminates the necessity of having a thick piezoelectric layer sandwiched between two metal layers.

In the present invention implementation of surface acoustic wave resonators using the standard CMOS fabrication technology with additional post processing techniques is provided. The fact that the fabrication process of this SAW resonator is highly compatible with current integrated circuit processing techniques makes it extremely desirable since it is not only cost effective but also allows the resonator features to be less prone to manufacturing defects due to the maturity of CMOS technology. In this design the SAW resonator utilized the minimum feature sizes possible in the available 0.6 micron AMI CMOS process to realize a 1.15 GHz surface acoustic wave resonator.

The fabricated CMOS resonators were measured and modeled as a two port electrical network through analog circuit synthesis. This model was used as a basis for simulation in Cadence to design a Pierce oscillator. The Pierce amplifier was designed on a separate CMOS chip. When connected together the Pierce amplifier and SAW resonator realize an oscillator capable of synthesizing a frequency of 1.15 GHz. By having both the resonator and the oscillator integrated on the same CMOS chip a fully monolithic frequency synthesizer is realized.

The SAW resonator design consists of input or output IDTs flanked by a bank of reflectors on both sides. Refer to which illustrates the important design parameters of a 1 port resonator. The key design parameter is or the periodic distance between two interdigitated fingers which determines the frequency of the resonator using v f where v is the velocity of the acoustic wave in the piezoelectric material and f is the resonant frequency. In this design run was chosen to be four times the minimum metal2 size of this technology or 3.6 micron. The modeling equations for SAW resonators which involve rigorous computations of transmission matrices will not be discussed in detail in this paper but the basic methodology of designing the SAW resonators and its accompanying oscillator circuit is outlined here.

The main design parameter that needs to be chosen is M or the number of reflectors. An array of reflectors is required since each electrode only produces reflectivity r of approximately 0.08. The equation for reflectivity was derived based on the theory of reflection in transmission lines and is given in 1A where is the metallization ratio of the IDT Z is the characteristic impedance of the region under the reflector Z is the difference of characteristic impedance between the free region and the region under the reflector and finally fis the resonance frequency.

The array reflectivity can also be approximated as 2A and the number of reflectors was chosen to optimize area while maintaining array reflectivity to be close to 1. The effective center of reflection or the line where the surface waves are assumed to be totally reflected is denoted by L is expressed as 3A where r is the reflectivity of each electrode. MATLAB simulations of 1A 2A and 3A using ZnO thin film material properties were performed to obtain the optimum number of reflectors which was found to be 125 for this design. The total effective length of a round trip in the cavity must be an integer number of . Other important design parameters are the distance between the reflectors and the input transducers Lg the number of IDTs or Nand the width of the transducers or W. Thirty two different designs of SAW resonators were first fabricated on piezoelectric substrates such as lithium niobium substrates to evaluate the performance of the fabricated designs. Four resonators with the best performance characteristics were then chosen and scaled to fit the 0.6 um CMOS in this design run.

The equivalent circuit model of a two port SAW resonator was developed using analog circuit synthesis based on the S21 frequency measurements made on the fabricated CMOS resonators. The SAW resonator has transmission characteristics similar to a series LCR circuit where the series resonant frequency is generated by both Land CThe initial values for the LCR circuit were calculated using the resonator design equations based on the reflectivity of each metal strip and number of reflectors. This basic LCR circuit was then modified based on curve fitting where the simulated values were compared with the experimental measurements. Several circuit topologies were implemented an least squares method was used to choose the circuit which produced the best fit. The final circuit topology that produced the best fit is shown in where it consists of Rx Cx and Lx which are motional resistance capacitance and inductance connected in parallel with Lp and Rp. The input and output ports are connected with parasitic capacitances Cp to ground. The circuit s S21 scattering parameters analysis simulations were performed using Cadence SpectreRF where the input and output ports were terminated with 50 Ohms. Comparison between the measured and simulated equivalent circuit model is shown in . The best fitting curve was found to have the values of Lx 1 uH Rx 120 Ohms Cx 19 fF Lp 132.8 nH and Cp 10 fF.

Perhaps the most important highlight of this SAW resonator design is that the SAW resonator IDT s can be implemented using standard CMOS technology. This allows the resonator features to be realized in the minimum sizes available in the AMI 0.6 micron CMOS process making them not only less susceptible to manufacturing defects but also less expensive compared to when fabricated as micromachined MEMS structures. The resonator features were implemented as 0.9 micron wide metal2 lines which are able to realize ultra high frequency 1.15 GHz resonators.

The SAW CMOS post fabrication sequence is similar to the CMOS SAW delay line with several important distinctions namely the presence of the aluminum ground metal1 shield which was placed to eliminate electromagnetic feed through. The other major difference is the presence of the oscillator circuit which is also placed on the same die and protected by a grounded metal layer as shown in Chip B shown in and .

Once the standard CMOS fabrication sequence is completed the first post processing step involves releasing the SAW IDTs from the insulating SiO2 layer using reactive ion etch RIE . The next step is ZnO deposition which was sputtered on the resonators. The final post processing step involves wet etching the ZnO to uncover the resonators pads.

Two separate CMOS chips had been designed. The first chip shown in Chip A consists of four CMOS SAW resonators was fabricated and characterized prior to the design of the second chip. Chip B which consists of three resonators and the Pierce oscillator circuit is shown in . Chip A was designed to characterize the ultra high frequency resonator of frequencies in the range of 900 MHz to 1.2 GHz. Chip B was implemented as a proof of concept that the post processing techniques of the SAW resonator do not adversely affect the amplifier circuit.

Once the post processing steps have been completed the die was bonded and packaged in a DIP40 chip package to facilitate measurements. The bonded device was measured using a HP8712 network analyzer and its experimental setup is shown in . The S21 measurements made on the 0.6 micron CMOS SAW resonators produced the parallel resonance frequency fp of 1.084 GHz and the series resonance frequency fs of 1.156 GHz as shown in . Based on the measurements the parallel Q was calculated to be 90.33 and series Q was calculated to be 36.125. The measured Q was not as high as expected since the die was overetched and some parts of the resonator was not completely covered as shown in the bonded die image of . The acoustic wave velocity of ZnO calculated from the measured curve was found to be 4140 m s.

To operate as a local oscillator the SAW resonator is connected to a Pierce oscillator at the gate and drain of M1 as shown in . This three point oscillator topology was previously implemented using an FBAR oscillator by Otis and was chosen firstly since it utilizes the current source M2 to provide the necessary biasing current to M1 as the SAW resonator does not pass any DC current. Secondly it also provides excellent phase noise characteristics. Mfb operates as a resistor which provides bias to the gate of M1. 4A 

To ensure oscillation the loop gain Ahas to be greater than 1 and the phase shift should be equal to 0. Based on 4A the size of M1 is adjusted to provide the necessary transconductance to counteract R where Ris the parallel reflected motional resistance at the gate of M1. For this design Cp1 Cp2 which also maximizes the open loop gain. The transistors were sized as follows M1 4.8 m 1.6 u M 4 u 872 u M2 9.6 m 1.2 u. The phase noise performance and steady state analysis of the oscillator circuit was simulated using Cadence SpectreRF to obtain its fundamental beat frequency of 1.154 GHz are shown in

Accordingly the design implementation and measurements of a CMOS SAW resonator is provided. The SAW resonators were fabricated using standard AMI 0.6 micron CMOS technology with some additional post processing steps. Upon completion the SAW resonators were characterized and found to have a resonant frequency of 1.15 GHz and its equivalent circuit model was developed based on these measurements. This model was used to design and simulate a Pierce 1 GHz oscillator.

No. 5 571 401 since other materials may also be used.

In a specific embodiment of the present invention the sensor technology may involve a series of conductive polymeric composite vapor sensors. The presence of an analyte may be detected through a change in for example the electrical resistance of a chemically sensitive carbon based resistor. As discussed above changes in electrical properties other than resistance may also be used these include the evaluation of capacitive and inductance changes.

Further the sensor material may be composed of conductor and insulator composites. This material may be placed on the substrate in a film. The organic nonconducting polymer of the composite absorbs the analyte which may be a vapor . This induces a change in the electrical properties of the sensor material. The sensor material may also undergo physical changes such as swelling. When the analyte is removed any changes in the electrical properties reverse. For example the resistance capacitance and inductance may return to their original value. Any physical changes would also reverse. The response of these types of sensors are reversible over multiple analyte exposures as well as reproducible over a large number of trials under a variety of ambient atmospheric conditions. Therefore a device fabricated using these types of sensor materials would have a relatively long service life.

In the case of using a composite such a nonconducting polymer and carbon black the sensor material will be temperature sensitive. When using temperature sensitive sensors the sensor should be kept at a relatively constant temperature to provide relatively consistent results. For example a temperature such as about 5 degrees C. above the ambient should provide good results. Further extremely high temperatures say above about 100 degrees C. should be avoided since these temperatures would destroy the polymer sensor material or rapidly decrease its service life. For this reason it is not expected that nonconducting polymer materials are to be used in the specialized environment of extreme high temperatures say from about 300 degrees C. to about 400 degrees C. or even higher. The polymer sensor materials will be usable in the normal temperature ranges from about 0 degrees C. to about 100 degrees C.

Using a conductor and insulator composite for the sensor material permits a very broad diverse collection of sensor materials. For example any conducting element including carbon blacks metallic colloids or organic conducting polymers and combinations of these may be used as the conductive phase of the sensors. Any organic material may be used as the insulating phase of the sensors. Furthermore an advantage of these types of sensor materials is that they do not have the stability limitations of conducting organic polymeric materials. A conductor and insulator composite also does not suffer the limitations from the types of substituents or restrictions on the ranges of swelling variations that can be obtained from backbone modification of pure organic conducting polymers.

After processing of a substrate or wafer is complete the wafer is tested to determine the number and location of the good die. The percentage of good die on one wafer compared to the total number of die on the wafer is referred to as the yield. Individual analyte detection dies are separated by sawing along the scribe lines. The analyte detection dies are then packaged and may be further tested to ensure their proper operation. These dies may be packaged in a variety of packaging material including ceramic epoxy plastic glass and many others. Packaged analyte detection die may very much resemble packaged integrated circuit chips. For some types of applications nonporous nonreactive materials like ceramic may be used.

In one embodiment the sensor material is deposited or applied at the wafer level before individual dies are separated. In other embodiments the sensor material is applied after the dies are separated.

Surface acoustic wave devices as biosensors are also well suited for the detection of biological agents. Positioning a receptor between IDT fingers to induce a phase shift or within IDT fingers to induce a frequency shift allows for electronic detection of bioagents. These devices have the dual advantages of high sensitivity down to picograms cm2 and high specificity conferred by biological receptors such as antibodies peptides and nucleic acids. Detection of bacteria viral particles and proteins has been shown with these types of sensors. Handheld biodetection systems incorporating these microsensors are contemplated as within the scope of the invention.

The surface acoustic wave biosensor arrangements may be used for real time sensing and for quantifying the levels of bacteria e.g.

Many monoclonal antibodies with high affinity and specificity for particular bacteria are available from commercial sources as well as the American Type Culture Collection ATCC . For example one of these antibodies the ATCC HB 8178 antibody may bind with the pilus with high specificity and affinity. Any known coupling chemistry may be used for binding the monoclonal antibody to the sensor chip surface.

It may also important to optimize the chemical linking of the antibody as well as the loading density. Independent fluorescence assays of the antibody density on the chip may be done using fluorescence labeled anti IgG. The chip may be incubated in phosphate buffered saline with fluorescein labeled anti IgG and may then be washed with a buffer solution of increasing ionic strength to dislodge unbound antibody. The chip may then be scanned using a Perkin Elmer LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer and the bound antibody density may be calculated using FL Winlab software which may also calculate various parameters such as for example the statistical variability observed in the surface loading between regions on the chip sample surface . This technique may be used to determine which of the coupling chemistries yields the best loading of antibodies.

Biological detection may include detecting of smaller molecular weight molecules as well as larger protein molecules amino acids and nucleic acids.

Current generated per analyte molecule bound to the biosensor surface may be compared to the response obtained from control. Analyzing the differences in the biosensor response may be useful for improving the chemistry and spatial properties of the biosensor arrangement to enhance its performance against the analyte of interest.

Nos. 6 627 154 and 6 495 892 incorporated herein in their entirety.

SAW devices are extremely sensitive to tiny mass changes detecting 100 pg cm less than 1 of a monolayer of carbon atoms. When coated with a chemically selective thin film the SAW device is rendered sensitive to chemicals that interact with the film. Sensors based on surface acoustic wave SAW devices are being developed to detect a wide range of chemicals. The SAW device is an extremely sensitive gravimetric detector that can be coated with a film to collect chemical species of interest. Based on these devices sensor systems have been developed that can detect trace ppm to ppb levels of airborne contaminants. Applications include weapon state of health environ mental and non proliferation monitoring.

Chemical species that have been distinguished as capable of detection up to 96 accuracy include the general categories of organophosphonate DIMP DMMP chlorinated hydrocarbon CCl TCE ketone acetone MEK alcohol methanol n propanol pinacolyl alcohol aromatic hydrocarbon benzene toluene saturated hydrocarbon n hexane cyclohexane i octane and water.

In these example implementations one deposition step is eliminated since standard CMOS metal layers are used to implement the transducers structures. The maturity and precision of the standard 0.6 m CMOS technology enables us to manufacture very well defined metal features to implement the transducers with minimum widths of 0.9 m resulting in very high frequency resonators of 1.02 GHz.

These examples present the design fabrication equivalent circuit model and characterization measurements of three two port resonators. The design of the CMOS SAW resonators is described first where the key design factors that affect the resonant frequency and quality factor are highlighted. Next the fabrication sequence of implementing the surface acoustic wave resonators in CMOS with three additional post processing steps is illustrated in detail. Characterization of the piezoelectric zinc oxide layer using x ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy SEM and atomic force microscopy is also reported. The fabricated resonators were measured to obtain its Sand Stransmission and reflection characteristics. To verify the resonant frequency of the device finite element modeling of the device was also done using CoventorWare . Based on the measurement results and the fabrication layers of the CMOS resonators an equivalent circuit model specifically for two port CMOS surface acoustic wave resonators was developed. Simulations using the

developed equivalent circuit were compared with the experimental measurements of the fabricated device.

The structure of a two port CMOS SAW resonator consists of input and output interdigital transducers which are flanked by a bank of shorted reflectors on each side. Shorted reflectors have been shown to have less

spurious effects compared to unconnected reflectors 5 and have been used in all our designs. When a sinusoidal signal is injected at the input port acoustic waves propagating in both directions are generated in the piezoelectric zinc oxide layer. The acoustic waves are detected and translated back into an electrical signal at the output port. The reflectors minimize the losses by containing the acoustic waves within the cavity to create standing waves or resonance.

The schematic of a two port resonator its important design parameters and equations are shown in . For preliminary design the acoustic wave velocity was assumed to be 3600 m s 7 . The highest resonant frequency that can be designed for the CMOS 0.6 m technology used the minimum metal 2 feature size of 0.9 m for the interdigital finger width 4 . The periodic spacing of the interdigital transducers is then calculated as 3.6 m and is shown in Table 1 as Resonator 1. It is assumed that the acoustic wave will penetrate the reflector array for a length of Lp at which point the wave will be totally reflected 5 . Table 1 illustrates the design parameters of the three implemented resonators. The designs

varied to verify the relationship between the fr and . The designs also varied the number of reflectors N .

The SAW resonator fabrication can be described using three step post CMOS fabrication process. In this work 0.6 m American Microsystems Incorporated AMI CMOS 3 metal 2 poly process was used. Standard CMOS layers were used to implement the resonator s interdigital transducers reflectors and the ground shield which are implemented using metal1 and metal2 CMOS respectively. The ground shield is crucial for elimination of electromagnetic feed through and isolation from substrate noise 7 . For future integration with circuits all post processing steps were carefully selected such that no process will require temperatures greater than 400 C. to ensure compatibility with the integrated circuitry. Circuits can be implemented using metal 1 and metal 2 with metal 3 as protection against the adverse effects of the post processing.

The first post processing step requires releasing the SAW electrodes from the insulating SiO2 layer. It was reported in 14 that reactive ion etching RIE can be used to remove oxide between interdigital transducer fingers. Timed RIE process was used to etch the 2.5 m thick oxide layer. The

calculated etch rate was 0.2174 m min which was sufficient to remove all the oxide surrounding the metal electrodes. Contact test was performed to ensure complete release of the metal electrodes. shows the complete removal of SiO2 from the interdigital fingers and reflectors. B. Zinc Oxide Deposition and Characterization

Zinc oxide has been chosen as the piezoelectric material due to is superior acoustic propagation and transduction compared to other integrated circuit compatible piezoelectric layers such as AlN 7 . To obtain maximum piezoelectric coupling 2.0

Zinc oxide deposition was performed using radio frequency RF magnetron sputtering where the 2.4 m thick ZnO layer was deposited at a rate of 0.297 m hr over the entire die area. Sputtered ZnO films are preferred since these layers are highly oriented and dense 15 . The temperature of the sample was kept below 400 C. to ensure compatibility with the integrated circuitry. The sputtering was conducted with 50 50 gas flow

To evaluate the quality of the ZnO the X ray diffraction 2 scan was performed on the deposited ZnO on CMOS SAW resonator samples to determine the ZnO s crystal orientation. Highly oriented ZnO films produce high reflection intensity from the 002 planes and have been reported to have good piezoelectric coupling coefficient 15 . illustrates the results of the X ray diffraction test performed on the 0.6 m CMOS SAW resonator sample. The reflection intensity of each phase is measured in log scale of counts per second. It indicates that the ZnO crystals are oriented at the 002 since the highest peak occurs at 34.20 with 2.9 counts per second cps . The Al layer has its peak at 200 where 44.720. The surface morphology of the zinc oxide layer was also investigated using atomic force microscopy where the root mean square roughness of the layer was measured to be 0.05 m.

The ZnO covered die was wet etched to enable access to the resonator s pads for probing 10 . The resonator area is masked using standard lithography process using 1.8 m thick liquid photoresist. The small size 1.5 mm 1.5 mm of the samples creates a tendency of photoresist buildup at its edges. To solve this the small die is first glued at the far edge of a large circular wafer before photoresist spinning. The die and wafer are spun at 4000 rpm. This method produces uniform photoresist throughout the sample. The sample is then patterned by placing the sample in a mask aligner and exposed to ultraviolet light for 18 s. The mask is a set of three squares which only covers the resonators. The sample is placed in developer solution for 60 s to develop the pattern. Once the protective photoresist has covered the resonator the sample is immersed in an etching solution which is selective to the photoresist as shown in . c . To etch the zinc oxide an etching solution that does not adversely affect the piezoelectric properties of ZnO is required. The H3PO4 C6H8O7 H2O solution have been reported to produce very steep etch slopes in 16 . This etching solution with concentrations 1 1 80 was used to etch the sample for 158 s. The calculated etch rate was 1.4 m min. The SEM image of the etched ZnO shown in and illustrates very well defined etched edges of the piezoelectric ZnO layer.

Based on the fabrication layers of the device and the equations derived by Morgan 11 Zeijl 12 and Datta 5 the equivalent circuit model tailored specifically for standard CMOS two port resonator was developed. The equivalent circuit for the resonator can be divided into two distinct parts 

The acoustic component describes the propagation of the acoustic wave within the cavity. The acoustic waves generated by the interdigital fingers propagate in the piezoelectric layer and act as a resonator and consist of Cx Rx Lx and Cf.

The parasitic component consisting of Rs Cox and Ct exist due to the structure and the layers of the resonator. As shown in the interdigital fingers were constructed using metal 2 layer on top of SiO2. Underneath the oxide is the ground metal 1 shield. This structure creates two parasitic capacitances namely Ct and Cox. The electrostatic capacitance Ct is the capacitance of the parallel plates of the interdigital

transducers and is described in 2 . Ct is proportional to the width of the aperture W and the number of transducer pairs Nt . Since the capacitive parallel plates of the interdigital transducers are placed within the piezoelectric material the relevant permittivity constant is the effective dielectric permittivity of zinc oxide 135 pF m 12 . W N 1 

Cox is the oxide capacitance between the input and output port and the ground shield and is calculated using 2 . Cox is not present between IDTgnd and the ground plane since in our design there exists a via or connection between IDTgnd and the ground plane. It is assumed that the resistance at the input Rf is the impedance of the network analyzer or 50 Ohms. 2 

As shown in when a sinusoidal signal Vin is applied to the input port propagating acoustic waves will be generated in the piezoelectric layer above the interdigital fingers. The incident acoustic waves will induce current Iout in the output port. The ratio Iout Vin is known as the admittance Yt . The real part of the admittance is known as radiation conductance which represents electrical to acoustic energy conversion. The radiation conductance Ga at resonant frequency fr is approximated as in 3 . 8 3 

The piezoelectric coupling coefficient was obtained from 7 where the phase velocity v and have been calculated and graphed for the multi layer ZnO SiO2 Si structure with varying ZnO thicknesses. 2 has values ranging from 0 to 0.032. For this design 2 0.017. The interdigital fingers are placed within a cavity formed by the reflectors. The reflectors contain the acoustic waves within the cavity reducing the losses of the acoustic waves propagating outwards. To describe the effect of these reflectors the reflectivity r a single strip was calculated. The expression used to describe the reflectivity in an array of short circuited reflectors was provided by Datta in 13 and is shown in 4 . The variables used in 4 were defined as follows where and the Legendre polynomials were calculated as P0.5 cos 1.5061 and P 0.5 cos 1.3280. For this design the metallization ratio was set to 0.5. The array reflectivity is described using 5 and is a function of both r and the number of reflectors N .

All the equations above were coded into MATLAB to determine the device s array reflectivity . For resonator design 1 r was found to be 0.01511 and 0.8278 where 3.6 m N 39 and 2 0.017. Since 

The acoustic wave variables Cx Rx and Lx are based on the transmission line model provided by Zeijl 12 and Datta 13 . Near fr the device acts as a resonator which can be modeled as an LC tank circuit. Rx is the inverse of the radiation conductance of the interdigital transducers Ga . Due to the effect of the reflectors Ga is increased by a factor related to the array reflectivity and which is half of the effective cavity length as shown in 7 and 8 .

The acoustic resistance Rx is inversely proportional to Gs and was described in 9 . The inductance Lx described in 10 is related to the total effective cavity length L 2Lp Ga and the acoustic velocity v . Since the device is a resonator the acoustic capacitance Cx is a function of Lx as described in 11 . Due to the proximity of the input and output port a feedthrough capacitance Cf exists and determines the parallel resonance frequency fp . Cf can be calculated using 12 where t is the thickness of metal 2 and was defined as 1.6 m 17 . The quality factor of the resonator is a function of the total effective cavity length L 2Lp and array reflectivity as shown in 13 . A summary of the equivalent circuit model values is shown in Table 2. In comparison with Table 1 the resonators were designed to maximize without occupying too much area. Based on 4 array reflectivity close to 1 can be achieved by having a many reflectors at the expense of consuming large area. Resonator 2 with N 100 has the maximum and correspondingly the highest Q.

The resonant frequency of the device was verified using CoventorWare s three dimensional finite element method analysis. The device was modeled as an electromechanical system where the solver was used to compute mechanical displacement in the piezoelectric layer due to an electrical excitation. The resonant frequency of the device occurs when there is maximum displacement of the piezoelectric layer in all directions. To model the composite resonator structure a seven step fabrication process describing CMOS and its MEMS post processing was utilized and are shown in Table 3.

Layers 0 4 describes the resonator s layers implemented using CMOS while layer 5 and layer 6 describe the reactive ion etching and RF sputtering of the ZnO layer respectively. The piezoelectric strain matrix coefficients used for the ZnO were d31 5.43 10 6 d32 5.43 10 6 d33 1.167 10 5 d24 1.134 10 5 and d15 1.134 10 6 18 .

The device s resonant frequency can be determined using harmonic analysis in CoventorWare . Harmonic analysis provides the structure s response to a continuous harmonic excitation. For resonator 1 harmonic excitation was applied as a sinusoidal waveform of 3 V amplitude with frequencies between 1 GHz to 1.3 GHz at the resonator s interdigital

transducers. Due to the piezoelectric properties of the zinc oxide layer the induced electrical excitation will produce mechanical displacement which in turn generates the surface acoustic wave in the ZnO layer. As shown in the maximum displacement in all directions occurs at 1.13 GHz for resonator 1 with 3.6 m and can be compared to its design series resonant frequency of 1.0320 GHz as shown in Table 2. The propagating acoustic wave in the piezoelectric layer has maximum displacement of 0.004 m.

The designed chip consisting of three resonators is shown in . To obtain S21 and S11 measurements each resonator was probed using two coplanar G S G probes in the Cascade Microtech 9500 Parametric Probe Station connected to the HP8712 network analyzer. The coplanar probes were connected to the network analyzer using cables SMA and N connectors. The experimental setup is shown in .

A Thru calibration structure was also included in the design to improve measurement accuracy. Both metal 2 and metal 1 in CMOS was used to implement the Thru structure. To avoid the probes crashing and damaging one another the distance between the two probes was set to be 200 m 19 .

The S21 measurements provide the insertion loss IL series resonant frequency fs and parallel resonant frequency fp . The S21 transmission magnitude and phase measurements as well as the S11 reflection measurements of resonators 1 2 and 3 are shown in and respectively. Resonator 3 shown in exhibited the best transmission characteristics having the highest parallel quality factor of 284.98. The high quality factor of this resonator is due to its structure where an additional layer metal 3 of reflector was implemented as shown in . Based on Morgan 11 the maximum energy of the propagating acoustic wave is within thickness of the piezoelectric layer. For our design the thickness of ZnO was 2.4 m and it is assumed that the energy of the acoustic wave is contained within the entire thickness of the piezoelectric layer. The first layer of reflector structure constructed using metal 1 has a total height of 1.9 m which is insufficient to reflect all the propagating acoustic waves. Stacking an additional metal 3 layer of 1.6 m with additional 0.3 m layer of SiO2 will result in a total height of 3.8 m of for the reflector structure. This height is greater than the thickness of the sputtered ZnO layer and is sufficient to reflect all the energy of the propagating acoustic wave. This results in suppression of harmonics having a single parallel and series resonant frequency as shown in .

Resonator 1 shown in exhibits transmission characteristics which are not well defined having very low Qs and Qp of 33.32 and 44.43 respectively. The low Q can be attributed to both the insufficient height of the reflectors as well as the design. With reference to Table 1 where both Lg and Lc of Resonator 1 was set to 7.2 m or 2 . This results in a distorted wave since L 17 is not an odd multiple of 2. Much improved resonant characteristics are seen in both Resonator 2 and Resonator 3 where L 10.5 for both resonators as shown in and respectively.

In comparison to Table 1 the resonators were designed to have series resonant frequencies of 1 GHz 857 MHz and 600 MHz respectively. The measured resonators had series resonant frequencies of 1.032 GHz 930 MHz and 602 MHz respectively. The difference between the design and measured resonant frequencies can be attributed to the deviation of the acoustic wave velocity value from the assumed 3600 m s. The acoustic wave velocity of the device can be extracted from the measured fs based on v fs . Table 4 shows the variation of surface acoustic wave velocity at different . The acoustic wave velocity is a function of khZnO where k 2 and hZnO is the thickness of the ZnO layer. For this chip hZnO 2.4 m. It has been shown in 7 that both the acoustic wave velocity and the piezoelectric coupling coefficient is a function of khZnO where the optimum is between 2 and 4.2. It can be seen from the Table 4 that at khZnO 3.5904 the extracted acoustic wave velocity is at its highest indicating the maximum piezoelectric coefficient. This indicates that to obtain maximum coupling each design with different should have different thickness of zinc oxide. This however is impractical for this chip since all the resonators with different were placed on the same chip and had to have a constant hZnO for all three designs. This resulted in different and different acoustic wave velocity for each resonator.

The S21 measurements can also be used to extract the equivalent RLC circuit parameters of the resonators 20 21 . The S21 measurements can be used to calculate the series quality factor Qs and parallel quality factor Qp based on the 3 dB bandwidth at the series and parallel resonant frequencies respectively Q f f3 dB. Based on the equivalent circuit model shown in the equations of the impedances for the equivalent circuit can be expressed. The average value of Q 0.5 Qs Qp and the calculated value of Rx as shown in Table 2 was used to obtain Lx as described in 14 . Since the device operates as a resonator Cx can be calculated using 15 based on Lx and fs.

The circuit can be divided into two sets of parallel branches. The impedance of the acoustic branch Zac consisting of the extracted values of Rxe Cxe Lxe and Cfe is expressed in 16 . The parasitic parallel branch containing Rs and Ct Cox calculated from Section IV.A is described as Zp in 17 . The insertion loss of the circuit is a function of these two impedances Zp and Zac and is shown in 18 .

The extracted equivalent circuit values are summarized in Table 5. Calculated values of Ct Cox shown in Table 2 were used as a starting point to obtain Lx Cx Rx and Cf. The insertion loss of the extracted equivalent circuit was graphed using MATLAB and compared with both the design equivalent circuit developed in Section IV. A and the measurement results. These graphs were prepared for each resonator and are shown in and respectively. Table 6 shows comparison of design extracted and measured quality factors for all three resonators.

Resonator 3 illustrated in shows the best results where the measured insertion loss 36.406 dB the extracted insertion loss 37.3618 and the design insertion loss 36.4395. The extracted Rx 10 kOhms was close to the design Rx 7.56 kOhms. The measured quality factor of Qp 285 is the highest compared to the other designs. This high quality factor is due to the increase in height for the reflector structure greatly reducing the losses of the propagating acoustic waves. This measurement result indicates that a high quality factor can be achieved even with minimum number of reflectors where N 33 for this design. It also serves to prove that the quality factor and the array reflectivity are highly dependent on the height of the resonator structure rather than the number of reflectors used. This is in comparison with Resonator 2 which had a lower reflector height but a large number of reflectors and produced a low Q.

This work provides both the implementation of an integrated CMOS surface acoustic wave resonator and the development of its equivalent circuit model to support it. This is significant since it demonstrates that the frequency of surface acoustic waves can controlled using interdigital fingers implemented using inexpensive standard CMOS technology with minimum number of additional post CMOS micromachining processes. Previous implementations 7 8 or 9 did not utilize standard CMOS process to implement the resonator s interdigital fingers but implemented the fingers using separate deposition steps resulting in a very high fabrication cost due to the necessity of having very thin and precise interdigital fingers to achieve very high resonant frequencies. The maturity of standard integrated circuit processing technology such as CMOS is very reliable in manufacturing very precise thin metal lines and for this 0.6 m CMOS technology used the minimum metal widths were 0.9 m generating a resonant frequency of 1 GHz. Higher frequency resonators can be achieved when smaller CMOS technology feature sizes are used. Currently the minimum possible CMOS metal feature size is 135 nm and can theoretically create CMOS SAW resonators operating at 7 GHz. Three different resonator designs operating at different frequencies 1.02 GHz 941 MHz and 605 MHz were presented to illustrate the feasibility and the performance of these devices. The measurement results indicate minimum insertion losses in the range 33 dB to 36 dB. The measured quality factor ranged from 33 to 285. Based on the measurement results and the fabrication layers of the device an equivalent circuit model tailored specifically to describe the two port CMOS SAW resonator was developed.

Comparison of the design extracted and measurement S21 transmission characteristics were presented. It can be seen from these graphs that when losses of the propagating acoustic wave is reduced by increasing the reflector height the design extracted and measured results are in accordance with each other. Although the resonators exhibited much lower quality factors than commercial discrete devices which have Qs in the order of 10 000 the quality factors of these devices are much higher than the Qs of integrated LC CMOS resonators which are typically less than 50. LC CMOS resonators are typically used when integrated resonators are required for circuits. The measurement results have also indicated that when the reflector height is increased using stacked metals available in CMOS technology the quality factor of the device is improved greatly. These designs although not exhibiting the maximum possible quality factor of the device was intended as a proof of concept that surface acoustic wave resonators can be implemented using CMOS with the minimum number of post processes. Further development of this work indicates promising devices such as oscillators and filters for integration with circuits. The quality factor of the device can be further improved by increasing the number of reflectors and implementing methods to improve the piezoelectric coupling coefficient of the device.
