This application is a nonprovisional of and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 983 337 filed Oct. 29 2007 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates generally to a system apparatus and method of data transmission that provides for representing data using ultra wideband pulses or impulses sending at least one pulse or impulse over an electrically conductive guided medium receiving the at least one pulse or impulse at a telecommunication interface having an ultra wideband pulse or impulse over a conductive medium modem coupled to the electrically conductive guided medium wherein the telecommunication interface is operatively connected to a non ultra wideband pulse or impulse over a wire communication modem coupled to a communication medium. The method further provides for recovering the data from the at least one pulse or impulse. In addition the method provides for interfacing non ultra wideband pulse or impulse based networks with guided line networks that receive and transmit data encoded and modulated using ultra wideband pulse or impulse transmissions . The method further provides for single or multiple channels of operation.

There are several trends in society that are creating an unprecedented need for bandwidth by consumers and businesses. Some of these result from the advent of the digital age. Today digitally encoded music can be played on MP3 and Compact Disc CD players designed for portable use in automobiles and homes. Digitally encoded voice is commonplace technology for cell phones and other forms of wireless telephones. Digitally encoded video can be watched from Digital Versatile Disk players DVD Direct Broadcast Satellite DBS Receivers Personal Video Recorders TiVo digital camcorders and High Definition Televisions HDTV . In addition machines using digitally encoded data such as the Personal Computer and game stations such as XBox Playstation 2 and Nintendo 64 are now ubiquitous.

The rise of the Internet and networks has provided ubiquitous connectivity for businesses and consumers alike but are being constrained by the lack of true broadband availability. In December 1995 there were 16 million Internet connections worldwide. By August of 2001 that number had grown to 513 million. In December of 2005 Internet connections worldwide had grown to 1.02 billion.

Also the demand for broadband connectivity continues to grow. This is a result of the increased number of users accessing remote sources of digitally encoded data and data intensive applications. Initially Internet content was largely text based and provided limited amount of services. However the Internet has grown to provide more bandwidth intensive content filled with pictures graphics and video clips. In the future the increase of available bandwidth will enable higher quality Internet content such as full motion video entertainment quality video streaming video and audio.

Even though there is currently a glut of high speed fiber optic backbone capacity with an overall utilization rate of only 3 to 5 the access network or what is commonly referred to as the first mile or last mile simply cannot keep pace with the need and desire for higher speed access to larger amounts of digital information.

There are many individuals and organizations who view the need to provide broadband connectivity as a matter of national importance. The Technology Network TechNet an organization of CEOs from the nation s leading technology companies has called on the federal government to adopt a goal of 100 megabits per second to 100 million homes and small businesses by 2010. TechNet states If most Americans had high speed Internet access whether by wire line wireless satellite or cable consumers could benefit from access to multimedia interactive distance learning increased telecommuting higher productivity easier interaction with government improved health care services and on demand entertainment. Currently the vast majority of so called broadband connections such as cable modem and DSL operate at less than 2 megabytes per second.

The Internet currently is built with many components capable of providing bandwidth at very high data transmission rates. However the major impediment to the delivery of high bandwidth Internet content and services is the transmission constraints from the major Internet pipes to the customer s home or business also known as the last mile. 

Today there are four basic technologies used for last mile access fiber telephone twisted pair cable and wireless.

Even though fiber optic transmission lines can provide a significant amount of bandwidth laying fiber to the home or business has proven to be too costly. Wireless is also an expensive access network solution and the total available bandwidth is limited and shared.

Wired communications for the last several decades has been dominated by a single signal processing technology called Discrete Multi tone or DMT. This technology is similar to the broader defined technology called Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing or OFDM. The vast majority of technology used on telephone twisted pair coax or power line cables utilize this technology. On each wire the technology may have a slightly different name and implementation but is conceptually identical in functionality. DMT OFDM is based in theory on very traditional signal processing techniques designed for small to medium bandwidth applications. The various technologies were developed as single asymmetrical two way data highways to simply deliver Internet to computers. There is a need in the world for a new more robust high speed solution.

During the last several decades research in the wireless communications and radar industries working on applications for the military and convert communications migrated to a much different wireless technology utilizing very short pulses that individually cover very large spans of frequency. This technology research resulted in a wireless technology now known as UltraWideBand UWB . This technology represents the fastest of the known wireless signal processing technologies.

Currently cable telephone twisted pair broadband power line access wired networks and wireless networks are limited by the physics of continuously oscillating radio frequency technology. Also the local in building networks cable telephone twisted pair and power line communication wired networks and wireless networks are limited by the physics of continuously oscillating radio frequency technology.

Not only are non ultra wideband last mile wired and wireless networks constrained by the physics of continuously oscillating radio frequency technology but so are local area networks LANs and data buses.

Therefore what is needed is a cost effective solution that provides very high bandwidth for last mile access networks buses and LANs that interface with non ultra wideband pulse or impulse communication systems which overcomes these problems and other limitations of current technology.

A general feature of the present invention is the provision of a system method and apparatus for increasing the bandwidth of guided line mediums which overcomes the problems found in the prior art.

The present invention is a guided line technology that is very high speed very low power low probability of detection and intercept works on any guided line to a home or business and throughout a home or business. Some of the benefits include a single technology for use with multiple mediums.

Wired communications began in the 1800 s with the transmission of electrical pulses down a telegraph wire. Back then a pulse might occupy slightly less than a second of time. Today with semiconductor technology the pulses or impulses can occur in billionths of a second. The invention of combining this traditional wire line communication method with the concepts of Ultra Wideband enabled the inventors to introduce a new wireline technology which is the subject of the present invention.

The present invention is a fundamentally clean sheet of paper application of wide band signal processing to wireline communications on all wire types. The nature of the technology has application in the To the Home implementations such as Digital Subscriber Loop DSL Broadband Power Line BPL and CATV transport. The technology also excels in Through the Home applications for home networking on twisted pair coax and power line. The key benefits of the technology are high data throughput very low power and precise frequency control and flexible implementation options.

A new wireline technology needs to have some very specific needs to meet the requirements of the future. The wires are known but the need for more speed requires more frequency bandwidth. This frequency bandwidth creates challenges. Many of the applications are known many are not yet known. The need to flexibly control the quality of service of the data is well known. The implementations of the past as shown in Table 1 focused on point to point To the Home technologies and separate Through the Home networking technologies. A converged platform for wired delivery will ease installation management and cost.

The present invention relates generally to a system method and apparatus for interfacing non ultra wideband pulse or impulse based networks with guided line networks that receive and transmit data encoded and modulated using ultra wideband pulse or impulse transmissions .

The ultra wideband pulses or impulses of the present invention are short low duty cycle and exhibit a fast rise time ultra wide frequency spread unique time domain and frequency domain signatures etc.

The present invention also known as MegaBand or Megaband or Multi MegaBand or Multi Megaband or Multi MegaBand or Multi Megaband combines the knowledge and skills gained from the study of GPS UWB and existing last mile and last 100 feet network technologies. The present invention provides a communication solution for many environments that is low cost lower power consumption large range of service resistant to interference and easily implemented over any hard wired medium. The present invention is designed to meet the demands of the emerging digital evolution which must support the simultaneous delivery of multiple streams of video and data content.

The present invention is also known as MegaBand or Megaband or Multi MegaBand or Multi Megaband or Multi MegaBand or Multi Megaband.

In one embodiment of present invention known as MegaBand a train of uniquely formed short duration pulses or impulses to convey digital data are used. It functions by the generation and detection of a pulse or impulse versus the modulation of radio frequency waves used in DSL as an example. These pulses or impulses are spread over wide frequency ranges utilizing an ultra wideband of available frequencies in the wire to improve detectability and are easily restricted to the various frequency profile envelopes defined in today s standards for DSL technology. This dramatically extends the rate reach of the present invention and significantly lowers the interference issues cross talk commonly found in other communication technologies.

The present invention enables fiber like application capabilities over any media while preserving the legacy network. It delivers broadband digital services over existing copper wires which can be enhanced with increased amounts of fiber as successful broadband applications require. This enables the benefits of fiber optics without the expense of reconstructing the last and most expensive miles.

Once inside the home or business signals may be distributed using telephone wiring power line wiring or coax wiring to reach virtually any device. A single technology capable of delivering content across any media to any device in the premises offers significant advancements and options in Home and Local Area Networking.

The inventors have successfully built a transceiver for the MegaBand prototype. This FPGA based programmable semiconductor prototype is operational and has completed testing on 400 to 24 000 of various wire mediums at speeds exceeding 100 Mbps dependent on the medium and distance.

The inventors have also successfully tested a very high data rate 500 Mbps version of the prototype known as Multi MegaBand. This version of the prototype currently uses the following sequence to transmit and receive data via UWB impulses over a hard wired medium receiving at least one stream of binary data framing the stream of data using Generic Frame Protocol GFP encoding the GFP bytes with control data to provide control data encoded bytes encoding the control data encoded bytes with a Reed Solomon encoder to provide Reed Solomon encoded data interleaving the Reed Solomon encoded data determining bit loading per frequency bin based on channel estimation data to create a data symbol performing a Fast Fourier Transform FFT on the interleaved data symbol array mapping FFT data output sub channel to a frequency bin to provide frequency mapped data performing an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform IFFT on the frequency mapped data repeating the previous steps until the IFFT memory is full then serially transmitting the IFFT data as one dimensional amplitude modulated ultra wideband impulses over a hard wired medium then receiving the ultra wideband impulses over the hard wired medium then recovering the IFFT data from the ultra wideband impulses by performing an FFT on the IFFT data mapping frequency to sub channel equalizing the mapped data by sub channel performing an IFFT mapping the IFFT output to data symbols de interleaving the data symbols decoding the symbols using a Reed Solomon decoder to provide the control data encoded bytes and decoding the control data encoded bytes to create GFP bytes.

One of the primary differences between the MegaBand and Multi MegaBand embodiments of the present invention is the transmit and receive combination FFT iFFT algorithms developed by the inventors.

Currently the Multi MegaBand embodiment of the present invention generally consists of a full duplex communications connection realized with two FPGAs over a single wire channel such as twisted pair coax power line etc. This is accomplished using frequency division multiplexing over the desired range digitally with the use of the FFT function.

In both the MegaBand and Multi MegaBand embodiments of the present invention pulse amplitude modulated UWB pulses or impulses are used to transmit and receive data the LDL Protocol based on GFP is used Reed Solomon encoding and interleaving are used and the channel is estimated. In the MegaBand embodiment the channel is estimated for the digital transmit and receive filters. In the Multi MegaBand embodiment the channel is estimated to determine the bit loading for each frequency bin in the IFFT memory. In the MegaBand embodiment of the present invention the coefficients for the multi tap equalizer on the receiver is calculated for the entire frequency range. In the Multi MegaBand embodiment the equalizer is calculated per frequency bin for fine equalization of the received signal which results in far greater bandwidth than the MegaBand embodiment of the present invention.

Optionally either embodiment of the present invention can be implemented in the baseband or modulated onto one or more subcarrier frequencies.

One prototype fully implements our Lightwaves Data Link LDL protocol described in the present invention which is a low overhead protocol based on the variable frame Generic Frame Protocol Standard GFP . One prototype currently delivers Ethernet and MPEG 2 video. Another prototype delivers Gigabit Ethernet.

Initially the present invention will be a two chip solution chipset consisting of a Digital Back End DBE and an Analog Front End AFE . The DBE contains the digital implementation of the present invention with the AFE serving as the interface to the wired medium including but not limited to telephone twisted pair TTP coax indoor and outdoor power lines etc.

Eventually the present invention will be in the form factor of a semiconductor chip that will enable the technology in various forms including performance media interface and port density. The present invention can be used to enhance virtually any existing equipment provide a scalable platform for new equipment and adapt to new network architectures.

The upper center channel frequency on telephone twisted pair is limited by the phenomenon of radiation which begins to occur around 100 MHz. The overall duty cycle per unit of time is variable and is dependant on the product of the pulse or impulse repetition frequency times a given pulse or impulse duration. The minimum practical pulse or impulse repetition frequency is dependant on the acceptable jitter for a given window of time. The length of the telephone twisted pair loop also plays a factor in which center channel frequency is used to achieve the maximum data rate at any particular transmission distance. The longer the loop the lower the acceptable pulse or impulse center channel frequency.

For a guided media such as a coaxial cable the practical range of duration of the center channel frequency of the pulses or impulses is between 300 kHz and up to 2 GHz which equate to pulse or impulse durations of 2650 nanoseconds to 0.50025 nanoseconds. One skilled in the art will recognize that the appropriate center channel frequency is dependant on the gauge or mixture of gauges of the guided medium the proximity to sources of interference the quality of the insulation grounding whether or not the cable is shielded and other factors as may exist in a particular application or environment

The pulses or impulses of the present invention are ultra wideband and may be based on the Gaussian waveform which are not gated sine waves and various derivatives including but not limited to a first derivative Gaussian mono pulse a second derivative Gaussian doublet impulse etc. or combinations of one or more of these types of pulses or impulses.

These pulses or impulses can also be formed by one or more waveforms that produce desired characteristics including but not limited to fast rise time ultra wide frequency spread unique time domain and frequency domain signatures etc. The present invention s time domain signature is a result of the time shift keying of periodic pulses or impulses which have well defined zero crossing and peaks. The present invention s pulses or impulses are recovered in the time domain by searching for the location of a specific amount of energy in a sample window. The sent and received pulses or impulses are a time reference against which other pulses or impulses are measured.

The present invention may also employ an alternating counter pulse or impulse method in which alternating counter pulses or impulses of any type are used to reduce inter symbol interference shorten the channel and provide a signal integrity that may result in higher data rates and a lower bit error rate BER .

The frequency domain signature is ultra wideband in nature because fast rise time pulses or impulses are used. The pulses or impulses are therefore transmitted over a huge spread of frequency and narrow band periodic signals are therefore excluded from consideration including frequency domain signatures of sine based waveforms sawtooth waveforms triangular waveforms square waveforms gated sine waveforms and variants of those waveforms.

The pulse or impulse characteristics enable increased distance and data throughput performance of the system over existing technologies. Particular attention must be paid to the radiation of the pulse or impulse energy in unshielded metallic environments such as telephone twisted pairs. For example radiation occurs at approximately 100 MHz on a telephone twisted pair which means relatively wide pulses or impulses compared to those used over air or a coaxial cable must be designed for use in this high attenuation high capacitance medium.

The advantage of the pulses or impulses of the present invention is their unique time domain signature. This signature enables a receiving device to determine the location of a pulse or impulse through a process called correlation. Correlation indicates a coincidence of energy when a replica of the sent pulses or impulses is multiplied by a received pulse or impulse signal. This coincidence known as the auto correlation a form of correlation enables the detection of the pulse or impulse position in very specific time locations. The correlation process is used to detect pulses or impulses at very low signal to noise SNR levels even down into the noise floor. The detection of these low SNR level signals is possible due to the coincidence of energy versus the signal with respect to noise.

There are two advantages of these UWB pulses or impulses in the frequency domain the ability to coexist with existing telecommunications technologies on copper wires and the ability to filter and correlate the received signal.

A pulse or impulse of the present invention spreads energy to beyond 25 of the center frequency which causes the signal to appear as noise to most narrowband wave oriented communication systems. On a telephone loop this characteristic limits the far end and near end crosstalk interference with other technologies operating on adjacent wires. In addition this characteristic allows pulse or impulse based services of the present invention to co exist on the same wire operating with other services such as but not limited to voice DSL etc.

The present invention is a lower power technology and transmits energy typically 10 25 dBm lower in power than a DMT OFDM system. The frequency distribution is very tame and ordered with little concentrated energy. This results in four main benefits. The first is lower crosstalk in systems that use parallel wires such as twisted pair. The lower crosstalk combined with the lower bit SNR requirement removes the limitation of crosstalk that typically binds DMT OFDM based systems.

The second benefit is lower radiation and interference to other services on the same or adjacent wires. This is particularly useful in power line and in home twisted pair applications. As the frequencies of transmission rise the opportunity for interference and coupling rises dramatically with victim wired and wireless technologies.

The third benefit is the reduction of high voltage analog components and power supplies which results in lower operational costs and heat. The present invention does not require a 12V supply for amplification. A typical signal of the present invention does not exceed 2 Volts peak to peak.

The last concerns the nature of high frequencies. As frequency increases all of the parts of the system react less favorably. The amplifiers react poorly to high power high frequency signals as measured by harmonic distortion. The same is true with channelizing hybrids the transfer of near end energy to adjacent receivers and the far end energy to remote receivers. The general exponential shape of the frequency distribution of far end crosstalk in the present invention is repeated in virtually the whole system component by component. This represents a significant advantage of the present invention versus DMT OFDM. DMT OFDM exasperate the electronics and the channel much more significantly. This also reduces the headroom of these systems because of the high peak to average PAR levels of the system.

In order to apply the present invention to multiple applications meet standard frequency masks and eliminate interference concerns precise frequency control is required. The present invention employs an advanced filtering method that enables very sophisticated filtering and banding. The filtering system is capable of exceeding the extreme demands of VDSL 6 band downstream upstream separation and the simplicity of Ham band notching. This flexibility enables the present invention to mimic any standardized frequency structure. The filtering is software defined enabling adjustment while in service.

The present invention experiences the same noise and interference that other technologies on the wire experience. As with these other systems error correction coding and convolutional interleaving are required to build an immunity to impulse noise. These random noise events can occur at high voltages at varying durations from a few microseconds to multiple milliseconds. Since the present invention is a short pulse or impulse based technology the disruption only occurs for the number of symbols equal to the duration of the impulse. By contrast an DMT OFDM system could lose 2 3 symbols and those symbols carry substantial numbers of bits. The present invention will return to operation immediately upon completion of the impulse event. Other noise sources such as outside communications disturbers radio stations and other consistent noise sources rarely correlate with the rapid pulse or impulse rate of the system. Most interferers are narrowband in nature and have a small de minimus effect on the equalization of the pulses or impulses and its further decoding. In power line applications the various noise sources and frequencies of the noise will have various effects on the performance of the system but in this environment a deeper error correction and interleaving functionality provide the required information correction albeit at a loss of data bandwidth.

The present invention can be implemented in multiple methods. It can be a dual channel point to point system or a multi user multi channel system. In Through the Home applications and Broadband Power Line applications multiple devices share the same wire. The present invention can be implemented to enable multi user multi application multiple media implementations. This enables a very full utilization of the media bandwidth without the extreme orthogonality tricks required for DMT OFDM systems. Operating as completely independent channels the idea of a single system across all three wires of a home is possible. The number of channels can vary from 1 to thousands by appropriate implementation of the present invention. For example a thousand channels could be built for a power line load control system or a system of up to 512 channels could be built for a home networking application. The technology supports dramatic flexibility to distribute its bandwidth.

The present invention also introduces the concept of plug and play to Through the Home implementations. With adequate data bandwidth and advanced channelization capabilities one can build an automatic install network methodology. By pre defining a configuration with a single system across multiple medias the cost speed of installation and maintenance can be dramatically reduced. As many service providers are implementing high speed fiber and copper systems for the delivery of new digital services the need for a plug and play networking system is substantial. Home networking represents a substantial cost of implementation of these new digital systems and a future cost of maintenance.

The pulses or impulses illustrated in are spread in frequency in excess of 400 of the center frequency. The pulses or impulses of the present invention create power spectra that are dramatically wider than traditional spread spectrum technologies which allow signals to be transmitted faster and further than traditional narrowband methods.

Alternating counter pulses or impulses are pulses or impulses in which the polarity of each pulse or impulse is 180 degrees out of phase with respect to the previous pulses or impulses. When ultra wideband pulses or impulses are modulated without using alternating counter pulses or impulses the pulse or impulse train will begin to experience what is known as a DC offset. The DC offset has a cumulative effect which drives the signal out of a suitable dynamic range. In addition when ultra wideband pulses and impulses are modulated without using alternating counter pulses and impulses the channel becomes very long. is an illustration of a single impulse response effect of the present invention s equalizer on that impulse. This effect combats the cumulative DC offset so that the received signal can be decoded using a peak detect methodology. An example of DC offset is shown in .

In addition the pulses or impulses of the present invention may be shaped spectrally to control the signal bandwidth limit out of band emissions in band spectral flatness time domain peak power or adequate on off attenuation ratios etc. The pulses or impulses may be produced by various methods that are known to one of ordinary skill in the art.

The system of the present invention can also be used to transmit one or more data bits per pulse or impulse or may use multiple pulses or impulses to transmit a single data bit. An uncoded unmodulated pulse or impulse train containing a regularly occurring pattern of pulses or impulses will produce in the frequency domain a set of comb lines within the power spectrum of a single pulse or impulse. These comb lines identify areas of peak power and can cause interference with other services transmitting on the same or nearby wire.

Optionally in order to reduce the areas of peak power noted in the comb lines discussed above the energy can be spread more uniformly by using pseudo random noise PN codes to dither each pulse or impulse in a pulse or impulse train relative to each pulse or impulse nominal position. A PN code is a set of time positions that define the positioning for each pulse or impulse in a sequence of pulses or impulses.

The PN code can also be used to provide a method of establishing independent communication channels for multiple users or devices operating over a single metallic medium. Multiple users or devices operating random individual clocks and different PN codes can be designed to have low cross correlation. Therefore a pulse or impulse train using one PN code will statistically seldom collide with pulses or impulses using another PN code.

In addition to PN codes there are other methods of channelization on the same metallic medium such as but not limited to time division multiplexing frequency division multiplexing etc.

The finely tuned transmit and receive capabilities of the Multi MegaBand embodiment uses a static pulse repetition frequency.

The exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate generally to systems methods and apparatuses for interfacing non ultra wideband pulse or impulse based networks with guided line networks that receive and transmit data encoded and modulated using ultra wideband pulse or impulse transmissions .

The basis of the present invention is the specific prior knowledge of the transmission timing and the existence and characteristics of a particular ultra wideband pulse or impulse. Whereas wave oriented communications seek to extract the meaning of a wave the present invention focuses simply on the existence of a pre defined ultra wideband pulse or impulse within a pre defined window of time on an electrically conducting wave guide such as a metallic medium. The key components of the broadband technology are the ultra wideband pulses or impulses the modulation of the ultra wideband pulses or impulses in time and or amplitude and or shape and or frequency and or phase and or combinations of these and the control of transmission power.

Recent advances in wireless communications technology have resulted in an emerging revolutionary ultra wide band technology UWB called impulse radio communications systems hereinafter called impulse radio . Although ultra wideband pulses or impulses are wideband in nature and similar to ones found in wireless UWB or impulse radio the science of using them over long distances on high attenuation and capacitance metallic mediums such as telephone twisted pair loops coaxial cable and power lines is significantly different.

It is often desirable when building wireless pulse or impulse radio receivers to include a sub carrier with the baseband signal to help reduce the effects of amplifier drift and low frequency noise. The sub carrier that is typically implemented alternately reverses modulation according to a known pattern at a rate faster than the data rate. This same pattern is then used to reverse the process and restore the original data pattern.

Bonded pair TTPs are balanced insulated conductors that are mirror images of each other. The balance is achieved by maintaining a consistent and controlled center to center distance between the conductors in the pair which helps to ensure that the signal does not radiate from one conductor to the other and cause damaging cancellation effects.

Cable television networks are generally categorized by their overall bandwidth which equates to the total number of channels they can transmit. Older systems are designated as 330 MHz and 550 MHz. Newer systems are designated as 750 MHz 860 MHz and 1 GHz. CATV networks use coaxial and or fiber optic cable to distribute video audio and data signals to homes or other establishments that subscribe to the service. Systems with bi directional capability can also transmit signals from various points within the cable network to a central originating point.

CATV distribution systems typically use leased space on utility poles owned by a telephone or power distribution company. In areas with underground utilities CATV systems are normally installed either in conduits or buried directly depending on local building codes and soil conditions.

An alternate embodiment of the present invention is a typical CATV all coax network as shown in with the addition of a multiplexer . The Head End Office is the central originating point of all signals carried throughout the CATV network that connects the CATV network to programming via transmission medium which may be fiber optic cable and or a wireless system such as but not limited to satellites and or media servers etc. Transmission medium may also be used to connect to data sources for cable line interface device customers through an Internet Service Provider ISP Application Service Provider ASP to peering points such as but not limited to another computer a server farm and data reverberating.

Head End Office is the multiplexing and switching center for the CATV network. The Head End Office can also be a co location point for an ISP. The Head End Office houses modulators to receive input baseband signals from transmission medium and generate a high quality vestigial sideband TV signal for output to a combiner . Combiners are used to combine several signals into a single output with a high degree of isolation between inputs. The Head End Office will also be the co location point for the present invention s multiplexer . This equipment generates modulates transmits and receives data signals from a customer switched networks such as but not limited to the PSTN and data packet networks such as but not limited to the Internet. The signals from the combiners are fed to an amplifier that is a low noise high gain amplifier that also stabilizes the level of VHF and UHF channel output signals.

The amplifier sends and receives multiplexed analog and or digital data streams to and from the distribution network. CATV networks are specialized systems for transmitting numerous television channels in a sealed spectrum rather than a general purpose communications medium so the topology of the network is designed for maximum distribution efficiency and is called a tree and branch architecture. Signals from the Head End Office are routed over transmission medium which is coaxial cable to CATV node . CATV node is a main distribution point in a CATV network to the various branches that serve smaller geographical areas. The CATV node relays signals via a serial distribution system of distribution pedestals distribution amplifiers to a customer s drop via feeder distribution network . The present invention is also applicable to CATV networks configured in a ring topology.

The customer s drop is connected to a interface device which can be equipment such as but not limited to a CATV splitter from which coaxial cable in building may terminate directly into the television receiver on 12 channel systems or into a converter where more than 12 channels are provided. Most modern receivers and videocassette recorders are cable ready and include the necessary converters to access the additional system channels. Systems providing pay services may require a descrambler or other form of converter in the subscriber s home to allow the viewer to receive these special services. Newer cable systems use addressable converters or descramblers giving the cable operator control over the channels received by subscribers. This control enables services such as per view pay without the need for a technician to visit the home or business to install the special service. In addition the customer drop may terminate at an interface device as shown in .

The CATV network described in will continue to provide their normal media and data services over their network. In addition the multiplexer in the Head End Office will generate ultra wideband transmissions over the CATV network operating near or in the noise level in order to create additional channels for greater bandwidth. The ultra wideband pulses or impulses may be non convolved or convolved prior to transmission.

In addition once inside building high data rate Home PNA type systems can be built using the ultra wideband pulse or impulse transmissions of the present invention over telephone twisted pairs or electrical wiring

The following is an example of retrieving an Internet web page using the CATV embodiment of the present invention as shown in A user with the service of the present invention over their CATV provider s network wishes to use their PC to access a web page from a remote server. The client device such as but not limited to a PC is connected either internally or externally to a stand alone line interface device as shown in or integrated into a device.

The PC uses Internet browser software such as but not limited to Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 in order to initiate the following steps that would generally be required to connect to the remote server using a standard client server architecture using a line interface device as shown in for access to the Internet over a CATV network through an Internet Service Provider ISP using MegaBand in order to retrieve the following file.

This entire process may be repeated several times in order to retrieve a single web page or transmit other types of digital data at high speeds such as but not limited to voice music video software communicate with an Application Service Provider ASP video conferencing etc.

The CATV network as shown in can provide a number of interface points between communication systems running on standard communication systems over fiber wireless and wired medium and the present invention which is a UWB over a wired communication system.

Cable television networks are generally categorized by their overall bandwidth which equates to the total number of channels they can transmit. Older systems are designated as 330 MHz and 550 MHz. Newer systems are designated as 750 MHz 860 MHz and 1 GHz. CATV networks use coaxial and or fiber optic cable to distribute video audio and data signals to homes or other establishments that subscribe to the service. Systems with bi directional capability can also transmit signals from various points within the cable network to a central originating point.

CATV distribution systems typically use leased space on utility poles owned by a telephone or power distribution company. In areas with underground utilities CATV systems are normally installed either in conduits or buried directly depending on local building codes and soil conditions.

The Head End Office for the CATV electrical power distribution network is the central originating point of all signals carried throughout the CATV electrical distribution network that connects the CATV electrical power distribution network to programming via transmission medium which may be fiber optic cable and or a wireless system such as but not limited to satellites and or media servers etc. Transmission medium may also be used to connect to data sources for cable line interface device customers through an Internet Service Provider ISP Application Service Provider ASP to peering points such as but not limited to another computer a server farm and data reverberating.

Head End Office for the CATV electrical power distribution network is the multiplexing and switching center for the CATV electrical power distribution network. The Head End Office for the CATV electrical power distribution network can also be a co location point for an ISP. The Head End Office for the CATV electrical power distribution network houses modulators to receive input baseband signals from transmission medium and generate a high quality vestigial sideband TV signal for output to a combiner . Combiners are used to combine several signals into a single output with a high degree of isolation between inputs. The Head End Office for the CATV electrical power distribution network will also be the co location point for the present invention s multiplexer . This equipment generates modulates transmits and receives data signals from a customer switched networks such as but not limited to the PSTN and data packet networks such as but not limited to the Internet. The signals from the combiners are fed to an amplifier that is a low noise high gain amplifier that also stabilizes the level of VHF and UHF channel output signals.

The amplifier sends and receives multiplexed analog and or digital data streams to and from the CATV electrical power distribution network. Signals from the Head End Office for the CATV electrical power distribution network are routed over transmission medium which is coaxial cable to CATV node . CATV node is a main distribution point in a CATV electrical power distribution network to the various branches that serve smaller geographical areas. The CATV node relays signals via a serial distribution system of distribution pedestals distribution amplifiers to a customer s drop via feeder distribution network . The customer s drop can be telephone twisted pair TTP coax or a low voltage power line. The feeder distribution network for this embodiment of the present can be either fiber or electrical power distribution lines.

The customer s drop is connected to a interface device which can be equipment such as but not limited to a CATV splitter from which coaxial cable in xbuilding may terminate directly into the television receiver on 12 channel systems or into a converter where more than 12 channels are provided. Most modern receivers and videocassette recorders are cable ready and include the necessary converters to access the additional system channels. Systems providing pay services may require a descrambler or other form of converter in the subscriber s home to allow the viewer to receive these special services. Newer cable systems use addressable converters or descramblers giving the cable operator control over the channels received by subscribers. This control enables services such as per view pay without the need for a technician to visit the home or business to install the special service. In addition the customer drop may terminate at an interface device as shown in .

The CATV electrical power distribution network described in will continue to provide their normal media and data services over their network. In addition the multiplexer in the Head End Office will generate ultra wideband transmissions over the CATV network operating near or in the noise level in order to create additional channels for greater bandwidth. The ultra wideband pulses or impulses may be non convolved or convolved prior to transmission.

In addition once inside building high data rate Home PNA type systems can be built using the ultra wideband pulse or impulse transmissions of the present invention over telephone twisted pairs or electrical wiring

The following is an example of retrieving an Internet web page using the CATV electrical power distribution network embodiment of the present invention as shown in a user with the service of the present invention over their provider s CATV electrical power distribution network wishes to use their PC to access a web page from a remote server. The client device such as but not limited to a PC is connected either internally or externally to a stand alone line interface device as shown in or integrated into a device.

The PC uses Internet browser software such as but not limited to Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 in order to initiate the following steps that would generally be required to connect to the remote server using a standard client server architecture using a line interface device as shown in for access to the Internet over a CATV electrical power distribution network through an Internet Service Provider ISP in order to retrieve the following file.

This entire process may be repeated several times in order to retrieve a single web page or transmit other types of digital data at high speeds such as but not limited to voice music video software communicate with an Application Service Provider ASP video conferencing etc.

The implementation of each Tx and Rx section consist of an FFT and an iFFT block which will have a transform size of 32 and 16 384 respectively. This provides 512 channels which is also the basis for the mapping function. The present invention in the Multi MegaBand implementation may optimize the mapping function in the future as the FFT functions are constructed with input and output buffers and also since the data being processed is real only data there is opportunity for optimization based on a transform size of 8192 with 16 384 real only inputs.

For the current version of the present invention N 32 and M 512 therefore K 481. ZTx is the real only transmitted output.

On the Rx PHY side the Tx process as shown in would be reversed replacing the iFFT with an FFT and the FFT with an iFFT as shown in . In actual practice the goal would be to make Tx and Rx the same core while allowing for separate Tx and Rx parameters.

On the Tx side pre emphasis is required which is a gain gradient applied across all channels. This gradient is currently a linear function with a definable slope where each point on the slope is equal to the gain of a specific channel which is a net effect that provides gain control across frequencies.

The system captures training data from time to time on each channel in order to calculate and update complex frequency domain coefficients. Each set of coefficients is derived from 32 complex values captured on each of the 512 channels. The reciprocal of these 32 complex values will be the 32 coefficients used for that channel s output from the 16K FFT. For the Multi MegaBand implementation of the present invention this calculation is performed in software but in the future it will likely be a hardware function that will allow the calculation to be performed more quickly and more frequently.

The Multi MegaBand embodiment of the present invention is very elegant. It provides precise dynamic spectrum control of the overall channel in response to the channel estimation while also providing precise dynamic logical control of the multiple Multi MegaBand channels of users devices bandwidth and Quality of Service QoS .

The Multi MegaBand transceiver as described in A and B can alternatively operate as MegaBand transmitter and receiver as illustrated in . The transceiver architecture includes a media dependent signal section media independent digital transceiver section and a section that deals with higher layer protocols . The media independent digital transceiver section includes a Multi MegaBand Medium Access Control MAC coupled between a conventional baseboard physical layer and the higher layer protocols .

The media independent digital transceiver section includes the Multi MegaBand MAC and the physical Layer . In accordance with the present invention the Multi MegaBand MAC is the data link sublayer that is responsible for transferring data to and from the physical layer and provides the protocol and control to enable interface to each of the local area mediums. The physical layer is coupled to the Multi MegaBand MAC and includes circuitry for converting analog data received from the analog front end AFE to digital data and for converting digital data received from the Multi MegaBand MAC to analog data for transmission to the AFE . This architecture can be used for any type of Multi MegaBand enabled user devices such as but not limited to power line devices landline phones VoIP phones computers etc. This architecture also supports the use of non Multi MegaBand devices such as but not limited to power line devices landline phones VoIP phones computers etc. The transceiver can serve as an interface point between Multi MegaBand portions of the network and non Multi MegaBand portions of the network.

The media dependent mixed signal section includes at least one analog front end AFE for interfacing with a specific medium including but not limited to telephone twisted pairs CAT 5 wires coaxial cables and power lines. Using more than one media dependent mixed signal section additional electrically conductive hard wired mediums can be used simultaneously by the present invention. An AFE includes the transmitter receiver and other typical hardware and software providing the interface between a specific medium and the physical layer for encoding decoding and modulating demodulating.

With an interface point adapted to communicate over more than one electronically conductive hard wired medium each end user or end device can communicate device to device via the interface point. In addition direct communication between terminal devices is enabled over the same transmission medium.

In another embodiment the end user device can also include a repeater section adapted to communicate directly with a non Multi MegaBand communication device operating within the local area network. The repeater section only provides for interface between one type of Multi MegaBand medium or enabled device and the non Multi MegaBand communication medium or device where the interface point coordinates interfaces to all Multi MegaBand to non Multi MegaBand devices and mediums. There is only a single interface point in the local area network. The repeater section is designed to extend the reach of the network to non Multi MegaBand communication devices or mediums which can not interface the interface point directly. The repeater section includes an AFE adapted to communicate with the non Multi MegaBand communication device or medium. Thus for example a MegaBand enabled or Multi MegaBand enabled power line device adapted with a repeater section can communicate directly with non Multi MegaBand communication devices or mediums as well as with other devices computers phones etc that are connected via other mediums such as phone lines coaxial cables etc. via the interface point.

As stated above the interface point coordinates and interconnects interface between any user devices connected to the same or different media within the local Area Network. The interface or communication link or bridge is enabled by the LDL Protocol MAC frames and is transparent to layers above the MAC. There is no upper layer bridging is needed for interconnecting two devices using different communications media or different data transmission technologies Multi MegaBand and non Multi MegaBand.

Multiple dual MAC IPs such as IP can also be configured to form an extended service set to enable extended coverage. illustrates a preferred embodiment of an extended service architecture according to the present invention including a primary MAC IP and two secondary IPs . Each IP includes the dual MAC architecture described above at in . The primary IP coordinates and interconnects interface of closely located non Multi MegaBand communication devices and Multi MegaBand devices and the secondary IPs . The secondary IPs coordinate interface of remote non Multi MegaBand communication devices and Multi MegaBand user devices and connect them to the primary IP . A set of devices controlled directly by a specific MAC PHY pair of an IP constitutes a logical device group. shows four separate device groups Device Group includes a group of non Multi MegaBand communication devices controlled directly by a first MAC PHY pair in the primary IP Device Group includes a group of Multi MegaBand devices controlled directly by a second MAC PHY pair in the primary IP Device Group which includes a group of Multi MegaBand devices controlled directly by a first MAC PHY pair in secondary IP and Device Group which includes a group of non Multi MegaBand communication devices controlled directly by a first MAC PHY pair in secondary IP .

Connections between the primary IP and the secondary IPs share the medium as the user devices and are based on the LDL Protocol MAC as well. Each of the secondary IPs function as user devices in a device group of the primary IP . So IP is in communication with IP via the same non Multi MegaBand communication device medium as the non Multi MegaBand communication devices of Device Group and IP is in communication with IP via the same Multi MegaBand medium as the Multi MegaBand devices of Device Group . This advantageous approach enables a seamless internetworking over one or more electrically conductive hard wired mediums between Multi MegaBand communication systems and non Multi MegaBand communication systems using common hardware and or software components and standard protocol layering in an extended device group configuration and provides a means for in local area LDL protocol inter device group operation using existing premises wiring.

In some exemplary embodiments the interface points and can be implemented in a local area small office or other situations where networking is desired without adding additional infrastructure.

The present invention is transport protocol agnostic. The system may be configured to use standardized or proprietary transport protocols. Standardized network and transport protocols include but are not limited to Ethernet Asynchronous Transport Mode ATM Synchronous Optical Network SONET IP based protocols such as File Transfer Protocols FTP Transmission Control Protocol TCP Hyper text Transport Protocol HTTP Internetwork Packet Exchange IPX Motion Picture Expert Group MPEG MPEG 1 Audio 3 MP3 and System Network Architecture SNA .

Lightwaves Data Link LDL is a proprietary data packet architecture designed for use in the present invention s preferred embodiment on telephone twisted pair networks and alternatively the LDL protocol has been designed to be easily adaptable to other embodiments of the present invention including but not limited to CATV LAN indoor and outdoor powerline and Data Bus. Additionally LDL could be used with other standardized or proprietary data transport systems and methods.

LDL is based upon Lucent s Simple Data Link Protocol SDL and IETF s RFC 2823 titled PPP over Simple Data Link using SONET SDH with ATM like Framing. LDL encapsulates protocol data units PDUs such as Internet Protocol IP Internetwork Packet Exchange IPX etc. for transport using the present invention s data transmission system. LDL uses some of the same constructs provided in SDL. The LDL frames are illustrated in Charts 4 through 7 below.

The LDL header contains two fields and when used together function as the frame delimiter for LDL. Every LDL frame transmitted requires a complete LDL Header containing the LDL Payload Data Length PDL and the LDL Payload Length CRC fields.

The LDL Payload Data Length contains the number of octets contained within the LDL Payload Data Area. Its value dictates the type of LDL frame transmitted. As examples 

The Payload Length CRC contains the CRC 16 or CRC 32 calculation of the LDL Payload Length contained in the LDL Payload Data Length.

The LDL Private Area consists of 4 octets divided into 3 octets described in Chart 7 for the LDL frame priority the frame type broadcast type and stream ID. With the exception of an LDL Idle Frame every LDL Frame requires a LDL Private area consisting of 6 octets in length.

The LDL Payload Area contains the encapsulated PDUs to be transmitted between multiple LDL devices. When an LDL frame contains a payload the LDL Payload Area ranges from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 65 535 octets in size.

Cycle Redundancy Check CRC 16 and 32 bit is an algorithm based upon the use of polynomial arithmetic that assigns a CRC value equal to the remainder of dividing the LDL Private and Payload Data Areas if used by a divisor representing a polynomial. It can process any payload of any size so the length of the payload in combination with the LDL private area is not an issue. LDL idle frames do not contain a CRC and the size of the CRC field is dependent on the type of the LDL frame used.

LDL octets are received into an octet buffer or other memory and storage caching mechanism that is subsequently processed by the LDL decoder. The search begins at the beginning of the octet buffer and compares CRC 16 value of the current octet and value of the next octet. If there is no match then the current octet is discarded and the process moves to the next octet in the buffer.

If there is a match between these two values then it is known with a high degree of probability that a valid LDL length octet has been found. Using the assumption this is the actual length a calculation is performed to determine the location of the next LDL frame s length and CRC 16 value octets in order to perform the comparison again for the subsequent frame. If the comparison is also successful then it is assumed synchronization has been achieved for the LDL frame stream.

Prior art has noted that some transmission methods encounter difficulty in transmitting lengthy successions of identical data values and as a result methods of scrambling data have been developed. Scrambling data to be transported over a network increases the density of shifts from binary value 1 to 0 and vice versa in any given stream of data. Scrambling is accomplished by coupling data streams with scrambling patterns to produce data patterns that contain enough shifting to reduce transmission problems. Due to the nature of the physical transport of the present invention optionally there may be a limited need to implement scrambling within LDL in preparation for the transmission of data.

Network PDU frames define network elements encapsulated within LDL and transported between devices capable of using the LDL protocol. Charts 8 through 11 define PDU frame outlines for Network PDU types such as but not limited to Ethernet and MPEG that can be contained within the LDL Data area for transport.

The Ethernet 802.3 minimum frame size is 64 octets and the maximum frame size is 1518 octets. It should be noted Ethernet standards do not include the preamble or start frame delimiter as part of frame length.

The minimum Ethernet Virtual Local Area Network VLAN 802.ac frame size is 64 octets and the maximum frame size is 1522 octets. It should also be noted that some references to length for Ethernet do not include the preamble or start frame delimiter.

The frame size for Gigabit Ethernet 802.3z remains the same Ethernet 802.3 with the exception that the length from the Destination MAC Address field through the Extension field is a minimum of 512 octets.

In the future the LDL protocol is designed to be flexible enough to handle Ethernet Jumbo frames that have a maximum size of 9 000 octets.

Since LDL is built upon the constructs of SDL an LDL frame can be switched to a SONET network in its current format with little or no modifications to the LDL frame. However the payload may require scrambling prior to placement onto a SONET network.

The encapsulation of an Ethernet network PDU into LDL involves no manipulation of the original Ethernet network PDU with the exception that the preamble start frame delimiter pad and frame check sequence will not be transported. Because they will not be carried in the LDL payload they will be reconstructed on the far end after arriving via the transport.

An Ethernet network PDU switching table is required on the multiplexer in a telephone central office or CATV head end or a device acting as a director for the transport of an Ethernet network PDU to the correct device. When a device or service is provisioned a MAC or network protocol specific address will be assigned to a particular LDL stream ID. illustrates the flow of a network PDU originating from a network interconnect on the CO side through the transport fabric to a Customer Premise Equipment CPE device.

The Ethernet network PDU Address to LDL Stream ID Table contains mapping information required to create a LDL frame. In addition the network PDU is encapsulated into the LDL frame after which the LDL frame is subsequently routed to the appropriate device. In the case of Ethernet the CO device will maintain a pool of MAC addresses to assign them to CPE devices in a manner to be detailed later.

The encapsulation of an MPEG 2 Transport TS network PDU into LDL involves no manipulation of the original MPEG 2 PDU. The transport of the MPEG 2 PDU while not exactly identical as the Ethernet PDU still involves the encapsulation of the MPEG 2 PDU into LDL and transport on the LDL transport similarly to above.

Unlike the Ethernet transport requirements the MPEG encapsulation into LDL will occur outside of the LDL transport core. The LDL transport core system will receive MPEG 2 TS packets already encapsulated into LDL. The primary purpose for this design is to 

It is important to note that the system is focused predominantly on transport while the application control logic for video feed selection and other value added features such as on demand video and audio is provided by application systems inter connected to the framework via a high speed interconnect such as SONET or Gigabit Ethernet. SONET will be able to accommodate LDL packets created within the video application easily since LDL is derived from SDL which has been originally created for use within SONET networks.

The STB or other video application device will be enabled to send messages back to the video system via LDL which will then be forwarded back to the CO based video head end and its management system. This interconnect can be done as SONET as well.

Each connection between the CPE and CO will have at least one video stream if video is incorporated into that particular configuration. If the transport is supplying video for more than one video device at the CPE location then there are several different configurations possible 

All video MPEG frames are multiplexed onto one stream. This configuration is illustrated in . In this configuration if four video feeds are required at the CPE side then all four video feeds will be assigned to the one stream assigned for MPEG video feeds and the single feed of multiplexed MPEG frames are extracted from the LDL frames and sent to the CPE video application for example an STB. This configuration is preferable where one video application or STB is used for managing all video feeds.

All video MPEG frames are assigned their individual stream. In this configuration if four video feeds are required at the CPE side then all four video feeds are assigned their own stream. Once the CPE device receives the frame for a particular stream it will extract the MPEG frame from LDL and send it to the CPE video application for example a STB that is inter connected to the device assigned to that particular MPEG feed. This configuration is preferable where a video application or STB is required for each video feed or MPEG stream.
