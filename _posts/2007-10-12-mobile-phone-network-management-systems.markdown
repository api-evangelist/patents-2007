Typically network operations have a variety of hardware and software systems for managing their networks. For example they have systems for billing planning and configuring the network configuring neighbor lists measuring and managing performance for triggering alarms and raising and managing trouble tickets. The data from all of these systems is usually stored in separate databases sometimes with separate databases of each type for every region or administrative area with little or no communication between them. This makes it hard for engineers to manage changes network performance. For example network operators would currently have difficulty associating a sudden rise in dropped calls with a change in the serving sector s antenna configuration that caused it.

Consequently in the course of their daily work radio engineers usually use a multitude of different tools each of which is limited to solving a specific problem. For example an engineer when performing a routine daily investigation into base stations that have a high handover failure rate typically follows multiple manual steps some of which are paper based and uses a variety of different tools. This is inefficient error prone and time consuming and does not facilitate the sharing of information and data between different engineers and teams.

According to a first aspect of the invention there is therefore provided a system for maintaining or optimizing a mobile phone network the system comprising a plurality of data feed inputs including at least one performance data feed input to receive performance data relating to performance of said mobile phone network over a first time period and at least one configuration data feed input to receive configuration data relating to configuration of said mobile phone network over a second time period and a radio performance optimization system coupled to said plurality of data feed inputs said radio performance optimization system comprising a rules engine to operate on said performance data and on said configuration data in accordance with a set of hierarchical rules and to output one or more tasks for network optimization a said task comprising a definition of a potential fault exception or optimization of said network to be investigated by a service engineer.

Embodiments of the system may be employed not only for fault detection and correction but also for dealing with exceptions and so called design checks so that a network configuration meets design criteria . Still further embodiments of the system may be employed for pro active network optimization rather than reactive response to perceived faults. Thus broadly speaking a task defines a condition of the network to be investigated by a service engineer in order to improve the performance of the network either because a significant reduction in the usual performance has been detected or because a significant increase in the usual performance is desired.

In embodiments of the system the rules engine is configured to operate on the performance and configuration data using rules of at least two types a first type to generate event data defining events relating to one or both of the configuration and performance and a second type operating on the event data and optionally also on the performance and configuration data to identify a correlation in space and or time in the event data configuration data and performance data. Thus preferably the hierarchical rules include at least one event rule and one correlation rule operating above this responsive to a configuration of multiple events. In preferred embodiments the performance and or configuration data includes cell sector specific data so that events can be raised in relation to specific cells or sectors and or radio or other components or elements of the network. Thus in preferred embodiments rules of the second type are able to correlate between a spatial and a temporal condition of the network for example relating a changing configuration of a cell or sector to a drop or increase in performance. In embodiments this correlation extends over multiple sectors or cells in particular over neighboring sectors or cells these neighboring cells need not be physical neighbors but may be counted as neighbors if a handover handoff is permitted between the cells or sectors . This facilitates sophisticated problem solving where for example a fault in one cell sector causes a problem in a neighboring cell sector which may happen say if one cell sector fails and a mobile device connects to a more distant cell sector than the one which would usually serve it.

Preferred embodiments of the system also include a third type of rule to infer a potential fault exception or optimization using the identified correlation and or one or more events and or raw performance configuration data. Optionally such a rule may include a confidence measure on a diagnosis to reduce the possibility of false triggers and or may incorporate a requirement of multiple correlations or events one after another for example to put the system into a watch state on a first trigger prior to making a diagnosis following a second trigger.

In some preferred embodiments the rules also enable a task to be allocated to a queue of tasks for example associated with a group of service engineers. Rules may also include rules to priorities a task.

In embodiments of the system a performance data includes data from counters for example from an OSS Operations and Support Systems OMC Operations and Maintenance Centre of a network performance management system of the network providing statistics such as number of dropped calls number of hours on air and the like at various levels within the network including cell sector and neighbor level. Performance data may also include output data from one or more specific diagnostic programs operating in the network. The performance data may be derived from multiple network elements and may comprise multiple files it may be discrete that is captured at time intervals for example the end of each day or it may comprise a substantially live feed for example hourly or more frequent. In embodiments the configuration data comprises data such as radio parameters aerial azimuths and other physical attributes of the network. Typically this data changes relatively infrequently and thus may be referred to as continuous data in some preferred embodiments where configuration data is stored this data is stored in terms of initial values and changes to reduce storage requirements. Configuration data may be obtained from for example a planning tool database for the network. The data feed inputs may further comprise an external data feed to received data such as alarms reboot data indicating whether or not a network element has been rebooted trouble tickets engineer performance reports user defined events for example a counter increasing above a threshold and the like. Such data may be available for example from a network management system on the OSS. Typically this data is input in discrete form for example daily although a substantially live feed may be additionally or alternatively be employed. Other types of data feed include a drive test data feed which is particularly useful for network optimization. Examples of events which may be generated by event rules include an alert on a configuration change an alert on a performance change an alert to an equipment problem for example an equipment alarm and a user action alert trouble ticket . Other events include volume events traffic events integrity events and the like. In some preferred embodiments rules for event triggering are predetermined and incorporated in the system for example stored in local or non local non volatile memory. Optionally a predetermined set of correlation rules applying to one or more predetermined sets of conditions is also provided.

In some preferred embodiments of the system an ability to provide a cell sector or network element signature is provided. This may comprise historical performance data and may include a facility or rule to detect a long term trend or change in performance for example over 3 6 9 or 12 months or more. Such a site signature can be useful in identifying performance changes over long periods for example due to cell sector occupancy say near a beach in summer or radio propagation for example trees growing shedding leaves seasonal snow on mountains or the like.

Preferred embodiments of the system store some or all of the performance and configuration data in a database and provide a common window or front end onto this database preferably abstracting the data in the database. This facilitates a generic front end for the rules for a range of different networks and by providing additional functionality facilitates rule construction. In embodiments the common interface is configured to implement a set of procedures or objects to operate on the data from the data feeds and to provide a common data access specification for this data. Optionally such procedures may include one or more key performance indicators KPIs . This facilitates correlations between for example two such KPIs or a KPI and a configuration change. Such a KPI may comprise for example an aggregated metric of performance of the network derived from data from a plurality of different elements of the network.

In some preferred embodiments the interface comprises a two way interface enabling events detected by rules to be stored back into the database. This facilitates implementation of higher level rules.

As previously described in embodiments the rules are hierarchical and result in the output of tasks for service engineers broadly speaking a task comprising a suggested fault identified for an engineer to address for example receiver fault in sector X . Optionally however a task may include a suggested diagnosis or fix for the fault optionally with a confidence level. The confidence level may be determined for example by data entered back into the system by a service engineer the system then determining say in what percentage of cases a particular fix corrected the fault. In other embodiments of the system correction of a fault may be detected automatically by the radio performance optimization system based upon the performance and or configuration data. Optionally feedback either manual or automatic from the result of intervention by a service engineer may be employed to modify or amend one or more rules in order to make the system learning. There even exists the potential for a network to become at least partially self healing optimizing. In embodiments the radio performance optimization system monitors performance and or configuration data from a plurality of cells sectors in particular neighboring cells sectors of one on which a task has been performed since action on one cell sector may influence and potentially correct problems on another cell sector by especially a physically or logically neighboring cell or sector.

In embodiments of the system the radio performance optimizer rules engine is able to operate on a collection of data from data feeds covering a group of cells sectors for example 10 20 or more cells sectors which is particularly advantageous for network optimization since this is best performed over a group of cells rather than individually cell or sector by cell or sector. In embodiments changes may be made and the effect on neighboring cells sectors may be monitored and further changes made to achieve optimization over an area of the network.

As previously mentioned rules may be predetermined but in some preferred embodiments of the system rules may also be defined by a service engineer and stored for later use. In embodiments a user interface and program operating systems such as an interpreter or compiler is provided to enable a user to define one or more rules using a programming language such as parsed expression language. However in some particularly preferred embodiments a graphical rule definition interface is also provided for example using drag and drop programming or workflow programming or in particular by providing a graphical representation of an operation performed by a rule operating on a plurality of events. One preferred format is a grid or tabular format in which columns or rows are associated with events and rows are columns are associated with correlation outputs for example to identify potential faults exceptions or optimizations. In such a case a user may define an entry in a grid position associating an event on a column with an output on a row and logical combinations of events may be described by multiple entries in a row one at each column location to which a logical operation on an event is desired. Thus broadly speaking in some preferred embodiments one or more of the rules are defined by a form of spreadsheet.

In preferred embodiments a service engineer user interface is provided for task output in which the user is able to access one or more tasks and in addition to list one or more events and or correlations or other intermediate data items which contributed to the task. Preferably a user is also able to list one or more network elements to which the task relates and optionally other data relating to the task for example an earliest latest event date or more generally a view of historical data relating to one or more events on which the task is based. In some particularly preferred embodiments the user interface comprises a graphical user interface representing a task on a graphical map of the network including representations of cells and or cell sectors of the network preferably also providing drill down from a task down to one or more events as previously described.

In a related aspect the invention provides an automated performance management system for a digital mobile phone network the system comprising a rule input to receive rules for operating on data from said network a data input to receive one or both of performance and configuration data from said network and a rules engine coupled to said rule input and to said data input to operate on said data from said network using said rules and wherein said rules engine comprises an event layer to identify changes in one or both of said performance and configuration data and in response to generate events and a correlation layer to operate on combinations of said events to identify potential faults exceptions or optimizations of said network.

Preferably the rules engine includes a diagnosis layer to output data from the correlation layer relating to multiple identified potential faults exceptions or optimizations to thus provide increased confidence or probability of identification of a potential fault exception or optimization in particular from a signature of the condition. Still further preferably a workflow layer is also provided to allocate one or more of the potential faults exceptions or optimizations to one or more tasks as described above. Preferably such tasks are output on a graphical user interface as described still further preferably a task grouping system is provided to enable tasks to be allocated to one or more queues for example according to business rules. In embodiments the workflow layer may also manage the tasks for example manually or automatically verifying and closing a task.

In a related aspect the invention provides an interface to a plurality of data feeds from a digital mobile phone network said data feeds including at least one performance data feed input to receive performance data relating to performance of said mobile phone network over a first time period and at least one configuration data feed input to receive configuration data relating to configuration of said mobile phone network over a second time period wherein said interface is configured to implement a common set of procedures across said plurality of data feeds to provide a common data access specification for said data from said data feed inputs.

In some preferred embodiments the procedures or objects include one or more of a set of operator or network provider conversion procedures to map from a data format specific to an operator of the network to a data format of the common data access specification a set of event procedures to identify or to record back into a database to which the interface is attached events in the network a set of network model procedures to provide data on the configuration of elements in the network and a set of network attribute procedures to provide data relating to attributes of the network for example a list of attributes say at a cell sector level and or values of attributes and or historical values and the like.

Preferably the interface is attached to a data store storing one or both of the afore mentioned performance and configuration data although in other embodiments the interface may provide a window onto a database managed for example by a network operator to provide some of the data to which the common interface gives access. Thus in embodiments the interface provides a window or aggregation point for multiple databases providing a common data access specification and a common set of procedures abstracting the data in the databases. In this way for example a common window may potentially be provided to data relating to multiple different logical networks which may share at least part of a physical network. This is particularly advantageous because of the growing trend for network operators to share physical network elements such as cell sector elements.

Broadly speaking the embodiments of the present invention provide an automated performance management system for a digital mobile phone network that streamlines an engineers work. The system utilizes the data in the network s existing systems and uses built in intelligence to generate engineering tasks based on events that are detected in the data and to provide the engineer with a simple process driven desktop application sometimes referred to as the engineering client based around a task list and a map. The engineering client makes it easy for engineers to make fast and effective optimization decisions by combining their local knowledge for example about problems that started when the cranes were erected for that new tower block that is being built near the shopping mall with the system s automated decision aids. The system also facilitates communication between and within the engineering teams.

In its simplest form the rules engine attempts to optimize the network based on the data received from the system. Network optimization is the process of improving the performance of a radio network through planned changes to its design. However it is difficult to judge whether optimization work has been successful unless the performance of the network is relatively stable. This requires continuous remedial action otherwise performance degrades over time because of the tendency for network equipment to deteriorate with age and heavy use. This continuous remedial action is sometimes referred to as housekeeping and although it is not strictly an optimization activity it is closely related to optimization and is frequently performed by the same personnel.

Because housekeeping activities are generally reactive in nature they are sometimes referred to as reactive optimization. This involves detecting investigating and resolving faults and other issues for example investigating equipment alarms that have inadvertently been dismissed by operations staff because no other symptoms were obvious. The aim of reactive optimization is to avoid lost revenue through performance failure and to maintain an operating baseline from which it is possible to address the true optimization activities. These are proactive in nature and are therefore referred to as proactive optimization. This type of optimization requires study deliberation and careful design and involves modifying the configuration of the network for example adjusting sector parameters and site configuration with the aim of driving the performance up from the baseline in order to achieve the greatest possible revenue. The above system facilitates both of these types of optimization and they are considered separately below.

Reactive optimization also referred to as housekeeping typically involves three phases Problem detection Problem diagnosis and Solution deployment

Without the above system each of these phases can involve many manual steps. For example optimization engineers have traditionally spent a lot of time running scripts and other procedures to extract and combine data from many systems and databases in order to be able to detect problems before they even start to diagnose the causes and deploy solutions.

The above system speeds up the reactive optimization process by automating the detection and diagnosis of many problems and facilitating the sign off of routine tasks and the investigation of the minority that require it. It is generally accepted that it is theoretically possible to automate the detection of 99 of network faults the diagnosis of 80 of them and the deployment of a solution in 65 of cases.

Within the system reactive optimization activities are handled as tasks. By default when you open the system engineering client it opens on a Task List which lists and ranks the tasks for the current area in a to do list. This means that engineers no longer need to spend much of their time looking for problems and can instead concentrate on dealing with them. For many tasks this simply involves accepting the automatically diagnosed solution.

Typically reactive optimization cycles are short and tend to involve one or a small group of sectors.

Proactive optimization is true network optimization. Unlike reactive optimization which simply aims to maintain the status quo proactive optimization aims to make adjustments to the design of the network in order to actually improve its performance. The present system facilitates proactive optimization by providing a rich suite of optimization and visualization tools and access to the network data in the database. The system provides a mechanism for embedding engineering best practice within the proactive optimization process while providing the flexibility for engineers to pursue their investigations in the ad hoc manner appropriate to the activity in hand.

The system is not a replacement for network operators existing systems instead it uses the data from those systems. Typically the data is scattered in a plethora of different databases sometimes on a per region basis. For example the system handles the following broad categories of input data 

Network configuration data. This relates to the configuration and properties of the equipment called network elements in the physical network such as the switches controllers sites Base Transceiver Stations BTSs sectors radios and antennas. Typically this data is extracted from planning tool database s and or configuration management systems. When the data relates to multiple technologies for example 3G and 2G the data for each technology may be extracted and loaded into the system separately. Although this data is preferably loaded into the system daily its rate of change is typically fairly slow after the initial rollout phase. After loading into the system this data is stored in the database as continuous values which means that once a value is known that value continues to be valid until it changes.

Performance data. These are counters and other statistics recorded on individual network elements such as sectors or radios . Typically this data is extracted from an Operations and Support Systems OSS performance management PM tools tool. This data changes rapidly and each load is separate and independent. This data may be loaded into the system daily but may instead be loaded more frequently for example every 15 minutes.

Neighbor data. This defines the neighbor relationships between sectors and usually includes parameters that control the handover function as well as handover statistics. Typically each sector has a list of sectors that are potential handover targets. Each source target pair is known as a tuple and has parameters that control it and performance counters that are maintained so that the network operator can monitor its performance. Typically the neighbor tuples and their parameters are extracted from a configuration management database and the performance counters from the performance management system. Like the other network configuration data the neighbor configuration data generally changes fairly infrequently after the initial rollout phase. Therefore this data is generally loaded daily or less frequently.

Alarms. These are events that are detected in the network prior to loading into the system. For example an alarm might correspond to a buzzer that sounded in the network control room when an intruder broke into a base station. These alarms are sometimes called equipment alarms to distinguish them from the performance and configuration alerts that are detected by the Rules Engine within the system. Equipment alarms relate to a network element typically a site or sector and typically include a description of the problem and possibly diagnostic information. Equipment alarms are stored in the database as events rather than attributes.

Site build data. This data comes from a Site Build database which tracks the status of new and existing sites and includes upgrades to existing equipment such as capacity upgrades. For example a New Site event might be triggered by the Rules Engine when a site s status changes to Integration in the Site Build database indicating that a new site is coming online.

Drive test data. The system may also handle drive test data. Drive test data comprises data captures from a survey performed by driving a test mobile handset through a particular area and capturing the data transmitted between the mobile handset and the digital mobile phone network to analyze the network performance.

Trouble tickets. The system may also handle trouble tickets from an external trouble ticket system. Trouble tickets are a means to allow problems with the network to be logged and the progress of the solution to be tracked.

The above list is not an exhaustive list of data types. Other types of data will be known to those skilled in the art.

The types of data stored or used by the system break down into two main categories discrete and continuous. This categorization affects how the data is stored in the database and which functions are used to retrieve the data from a data store.

Discrete data are values that represent a snapshot of an aspect of the network at a moment in time. For example a discrete data might be a KPI such as the number of dropped calls for which every value has meaning even when there are the same number of dropped calls for several days in a row.

Continuous data are values such as a sector s tilt or beamwidth that change infrequently. Once the value of a continuous attribute is known that value continues to be valid until it changes. In order to conserve space within the database values are stored only when they change.

The rules engine implemented as a Nexus Rules Engine comprises a number of layers an event layer a correlation layer and a diagnosis layer.

The Nexus Rules Engine applies special expressions called rules to the data in the Nexus database. The rules define the formulas and diagnoses that generate performance alert and other events and create the tasks that are shown for each engineer on his or her system display.

The rules define the performance and configuration alerts and other events on which the task is based. Generally performance alert formulas are run against data in the Nexus database for example OMC counter data a record of the number of key events from the OMC such as dropped calls handover failures etc configuration alert formulas against the configuration data in the same database and externally generated events. For example a performance alert formula might define upper and lower bound thresholds for each counter that is being monitored. A counter might measure the number of Radio Resources Control RRC Active Connection Failures caused by the radio interface. The formula might then specify that a performance alert should be triggered when the counter value simply exceeds the upper bound threshold. Externally generated events include for example equipment alarms that detect when an external piece of equipment is not performing correctly cabinet door alarms for detecting when a cabinet door is left open and other like alarms.

The rules may be more complex than the above examples. For example a performance alert can be triggered only when the average counter value for the last seven days exceeds the upper threshold plus three times the standard deviation or when the maximum value recorded over the last fourteen days multiplied by 120 exceeds the upper threshold etc.

KPIs key performance indicators are measures that gauge the success of the network and enable network operators to look at the network from an overall perspective track its performance and identify areas that need attention. For example KPIs are often used to test whether the network is performing according to targets and goals. KPIs are generally calculated from the counter data. The formula for an RF Dropped Call Rate KPI might be  Dropped Call Rate Drops Call Setup Success 100

Where Drops RF and Call Setup Success RF are the counters for dropped calls and successful call setups respectively. However the exact definition might vary from operator to operator.

Generally KPIs are generated by the system by the rules and are handled using calculated attributes. These are special attributes whose values are calculated on the fly from other attributes typically OMC counters using an expression that is stored as part of the attribute definition in the Nexus database. This means that it is possible to easily generate statistically valid KPIs for any combination of sectors for example.

Each triggered alarm is associated with an event in the event layer of the rules engine. Effectively the events identify changes in performance or changes in configuration of the network or a combination of both.

Once the events have been identified the rules group the events in the correlation layer to form a hierarchy of events. The lowest layer in the hierarchy of events comprises the above mentioned detected events triggered from alarms and KPI threshold comparisons. Higher levels in the hierarchy comprise new events generated by the rules from grouped events from the lowest level. The rules group the lowest level events by identifying known problems associated with such a group of events. By grouping the events the rules filter out the symptoms of a problem to identify the cause of the problem.

See for an example. Suppose sector in site A is exhibiting an increased rate of dropped calls and call attempt failures. By looking at the events alone we would expect this to mean there is a problem with that sector. However it is possible to create logic to compare the performance of the neighboring sectors to establish whether any of them are in fact causing the problem for example sector on the neighboring site B might have a decreased number of call attempts and a stable dropped call rate indicating that it is in fact the cause of the problem in sector A . It is possible to create a rule to automatically detect this and generate a task that instructs the engineer to address the issue in sector B.

The diagnostic layer comprises rules that apply diagnostic logic on the grouped event results from the correlation layer in order to create the engineering tasks. This could for example comprise the construction of a multi dimensional array of fault signatures using events to diagnose known causes of known problems.

Once the diagnoses have been generated the system identifies and creates one or more tasks to address the identified problems. Tasks are specific to a particular engineer or engineering team and are stacked in a queue. The queue is prioritized dependent on a number of factors including the age of the problems the volume of events triggered from a particular problem and other such schemes. For example a larger volume of triggered events for a particular problem in the network will raise the priority of the associated task.

In their simplest form the tasks themselves comprise a description of the suspected problem and a suggested diagnosis and an implementation of a solution. However the system associates each of the tasks all of the underlying data used to generate that particular task. Therefore when displaying a particular task the engineer can view all of the data that was used in generating that particular task which gives the engineer the context in which the task was generated further aiding the engineer s implementation of the solution.

In general KPIs are defined as scripts in the rules engine which enables them to be applied to any number of elements within the system in a dynamic way to give a measure of performance on one or more levels of the system. As such KPIs can be generated to evaluate the impact of a problem over not just one element but over an area. For example KPIs could also be generated at the BTS controller and area level and the results aggregated to determine the performance of the network at each particular level.

The architecture comprises a data repository called the Nexus database that may for example be implemented in Oracle running on a Linux server. The database stores data from a variety of different sources including counter data. This data is collected by the network usually by the OMC. Network operators use a variety of different systems to handle their counter data. These systems are called Operations and Support Systems OSS performance management PM tools and typical examples are Metrica Performance Manager and MYCOM. The present system may receive summary data from the OSS PM typically overnight . Usually this output will be in a comma separated variable .csv format.

The Network Data Loading Agent NDLA loads the output from the OSS PM tool into the Nexus database. The data is stored in the database in such a way that KPI key performance indicator statistics can be retrieved for a specified period for example the last 30 60 or 90 days .

The Nexus database also stores network configuration data which records the location latitude longitude height etc. and configuration beamwidth azimuth etc. of the base stations the lists of neighboring sectors etc. This data is generally exported from the network operator s network and neighbor planning tools in a comma separated or similar format and is then loaded into the database by the NDLA. Just like the counter data changes are stored over time so that changes in the KPIs can be correlated with changes to the network configuration. For example users can compare KPIs based on counter data collected before and after a cell s azimuth was changed etc.

The middle tier is a layer between the Nexus database at the back and the engineering client at the front. It caches information to improve the performance of the system and consists of the following 

A Web service based API which handles all of the communication between the engineering client and the database. Web services are a standard technology for exchanging information between computer systems across intranets and the Internet with support for end to end security.

A data layer which provides standardized access to and presentation of the data in the database regardless of its underlying structure.

The Nexus Rules Engine which applies logic based on defined rules to the data in the database. The logic is defined in an expression language such as AXEL.

Together the middle layer and the loading and back end components are known as the Nexus platform which is an enterprise platform that provides a high quality and scalable service for handling large volumes of data.

The Nexus database is the data repository. It is a standard relational database and may for example be implemented in Oracle. The database contains a number of tables that store the data. Other components of the system do not access the database tables directly. Instead they communicate with the database using stored procedures in order that they are insulated from any changes to the database schema that might be required over time.

In fact the other components do not call the stored procedures directly. Instead they call the middle tier s data layer which in turn calls the stored procedures. This is designed to insulate all of the other components from the database implementation details and provides an infrastructure that is capable of handling multiple database implementations. This means for example that if support for a different database technology is introduced only the data layer will need to be updated.

Stored procedures provide an API to the Nexus database. The API includes separate functions for each of the components of the system NDLA Admin Client Engineering Client Drive Test Loading Agent Reporting Client . Because the data is sent to the client applications through the Web service it is important for performance reasons that only relevant data is sent.

Data is loaded into the database in batches and is stored temporarily in two staging tables prior to being moved into the appropriate tables depending on whether the values are discrete or continuous for long term storage. All data is stamped with the load event ID which means that when necessary a batch load can be rolled back undone .

File Monitor. This is a Windows Service that monitors one or more folders for new files that are ready for loading. When the File Monitor detects a new file in one of the monitored locations the File Monitor checks the file s read write status and when it becomes writable which indicates that it has been released by the application that is writing it the File Monitor activates the console application and passes it the names of the file and the provider for data files in that location.

Console Application. This is a Command line application that has two compulsory arguments and additional optional ones. The compulsory arguments specify the names of the data file to be loaded and the provider to be used. At run time the application fires a processor which retrieves the named provider from the database fires up the data adaptor of the appropriate type .csv fixed width etc. iterates the rows in the data file running on each field the AXEL statement specified in the provider. The console application also logs progress reports any errors and emails them to the administrator.

Providers. These are specific to a particular type of data for example company ABC s 3G network configuration data in .csv format and describe how it is to be handled. For example the provider specifies the adaptor to be used how the date and time are to be generated the field separator if relevant the names of the fields in the input file whether they are to be ignored and if not their data type the name of the corresponding attribute in the database how it is to be validated etc. The handling of each field is specified using an AXEL statement. The data providers must be configured for every type of data that is to be loaded and stored in the Nexus database.

Data Adaptors. These are specific to a particular data format .csv fixed width or XML and read and parse data of that format.

Data Layer. Part of the Middle Tier this provides a standardized way of communicating with the database.

From the end user s point of view all he or she has to do is to use the Drive Test Client to select the drive test log files that are to be loaded and to enter details about them such as a description the date and time of the drive the engineer s name the weather conditions etc.

The Drive Test Client then copies the log file and its related manifest into a file location that is being monitored by the File Monitor Windows service which is part of the Network Data Loading Agent NDLA . However instead of firing the NDLA the File Monitor is configured to fire the DTLA when a new log file and XML manifest pair become available.

The exported file is then loaded into the Nexus database by the NDLA in the normal way. This requires that the File Monitor is configured to watch the folder where the DTLA drops the exported files and that a suitable data adaptor is available.

The middle tier is part of the Nexus platform and consists of a thin layer between the Nexus database and the engineering client. The middle tier includes a Web service based application programming interface API and all communication between the engineering client and the database is handled by this API.

To illustrate how it works let s consider what happens when the engineering client requires a list of sites and their KPIs 

Independence from database implementation. The engineering client and other front end applications are completely insulated from the database implementation. This means that the front end applications will not need to change should it be necessary to add new database implementations. Nexus currently uses an Oracle database running under Linux. Other implementations could be envisaged by the skilled reader.

Easier deployment. Interactions with the database typically require various libraries to be installed on the local machine. Because the data layer handles all communication with the database these libraries need to be installed on the server hosting the data layer only rather than on every engineering client machine for example . The data layer can be hosted on one or more different servers from the database itself.

Database licensing advantages. Because all connections to the database are made through the data layer this architecture would have significant advantages should the database server application be licensed on a per connection basis.

The middle tier may also cache data. For example it might build a model of the user s mobile telecoms network which would improved the performance of the engineering client and allows the whole system to be more scaleable.

Finally the middle tier provides a potential home for the logic. Separating the logic from the data and the user interface is good practice and means that the engineering client can be leaner and thinner than would otherwise be necessary.

The engineering client is a Windows .NET forms application. provides a conceptual view of the engineering client s architecture.

All communication between the engineering client and the database takes place through the middle tier s Web services which provide a collection of methods for accessing the data across intranets and the Internet. However the communication is handled by the engineering client s Web service wrappers. None of the other components within the engineering client communicate with the Web services directly. This design makes it easy to set up unit tests to test the various components within the engineering client because it is possible to substitute a mock object in place of the real Web services. This means that the components can be unit tested in an isolated environment without all of the complications dependencies and unknowns that are introduced when they are part of a complex system and data is being transmitted across the network. Each unit test sets up its own data within the mock object and use that within the testing of the component.

The application objects also known as business objects are the logical building blocks of the engineering client. Some such as the Network Model Site Sector Event and Task objects map to basic concepts within Insight and others such as the Event Manager and Task Manager control and manipulate the basic objects. For example the Event Manager is responsible for retrieving the list of events and does this through the Web service wrappers. The Network Model is an object model representation that models the user s mobile telecoms network configuration. The Site Sector and Event objects are part of the Network Model and are always accessed through it.

On top of the Application objects are the UI components such as the Attribute Table Configuration Viewer Event Navigator Task Navigator Map Chart etc. As their names suggest these correspond to the various elements that you see on the screen in the engineering client and they interact with the application objects. For example the Event Navigator UI component corresponds to the Event Log that you see on the screen and it interacts with the Event Manager object which as explained earlier actually gets the events that are displayed.

The Map object corresponds to the map that you see on the screen. The system draws the standard map layers and then draws other layers on top. The upper layers allow additional information to be displayed.

The UI components communicate through the Application Environment object which is the central manager of the engineering client framework it handles the communication between the various UI components and handles their state. For example the Application Environment object tracks which area task date etc. is currently selected. When the user selects a different area for example the Application Environment object raises a current area changed .NET event. When the UI components detect this event they update their displays accordingly.

On top of the UI components and the framework is the System Layout which controls how the various UI components are arranged on the screen. Internally the System Layout is a container of .NET forms and it has a small amount of logic to handle what happens when you open the client for an area for which there are no tasks for example. Instead of opening on an empty Task List it goes straight to the Explore Area tabs. 

The current selection represents what the user is currently dealing with. For example it might be a single site or sector a group of sites or an area on the map that includes a number of different sites. It is the framework s responsibility to track the current selection and to communicate it to the map and plug ins so that when the user selects something else they can reflect this on the screen.

The framework always contains the map but the plug ins might vary depending on the context. Currently the context simply defines how the map and the plug ins are arranged on the screen. For example there might be a context called KPI Navigator which specifies that the screen should be arranged as shown in the following diagram.

The context may be extended to specify which attributes are relevant to the context. For example a Neighbor List Tuning context might specify not only the plug ins to be used and how they are arranged on the screen but also a list of attributes that are relevant when users are configuring neighbor lists.

As explained above the Nexus Rules Engine applies expressions called rules to the data in the Nexus database. For example rules are used to create performance and configuration alerts and group them into reactive tasks which then appear on the Task List in the engineering client. The present system uses an expression language called AXEL and are run in the Engine context which provides access to the KPIs and the attributes in the Nexus database and a number of useful functions for raising events creating tasks finding network elements etc.

The Nexus Rules Engine is extremely flexible and does not control what the rules are run against. Instead this is defined in the rules themselves. Although within the AXEL terminology each rule is a separate expression you can think of each rule as a script and it is up to the person creating it to define its flow. For example it is possible to write a rule that specifies that it is to be run against the data for one particular sector only. However it is more common to create rules that are run against all of the sectors in a particular area or all of the sectors in all of the reactive optimization areas or against all of the base stations that are connected to a particular OMC say. This flexibility means that you could for example create one set of rules for use in dense urban areas and another set for use in a sparsely populated rural areas etc.

An example rule that is for example designed to be run daily for all of the reactive optimization areas is described as follows. The rule loops through every sector in each of the areas performing checks on a number of KPIs and raising performance alerts for any sectors that fail the checks. The checks might consist of delta checks which look for changes in performance by comparing the current value with for example the average value over the previous three weeks. Alternatively the checks might simply compare the current value with a fixed threshold these are called threshold checks . Delta check rules tend to involve heavier processing than rules that simply check performance against fixed thresholds.

If any performance alerts are generated for a sector additional checks are performed on key radio statistics which might result in the generation of further performance alerts. All of the alerts that are generated for a sector are then wrapped up into a single task. This avoids the traditional duplication that occurs when one task list is based on the top 10 sectors with the worst dropped call rate and another on the top 10 sectors with the worst call setup success rate because frequently both problems have the same or a related root cause and so many of the same sectors appear on both lists. By creating a task for each sector that has a performance issue in any of these related areas the engineer has all of the pertinent information available as soon as he or she opens up the task. In addition some criteria such as traffic statistics can be used to generate a task priority so that the sectors with the highest traffic are flagged up with the highest priority.

Checking the radio statistics only for sectors that have failed the sector level checks makes the rule faster to run than checking the radio statistics for every sector. This is a useful technique in delta check rules that are run against very large volumes of data. However the flexibility that is inherent in the Nexus Rules Engine means that these and similar choices are in the hand of the creator of the rules. There is sometimes a trade off between picking up so many potential issues that your engineers do not have time to investigate them all and attempting to pick out only the most important issues at the risk of missing some. The rules can be tailored to meet the requirements of your network and to fit the hardware and other resources that are available. In addition you can refine them in response to experience.

Rules that are designed to be run against a large amount of data are generally scheduled to be run overnight with perhaps the performance alert rules being run every night and the configuration alert rules once or twice a week. But again the flexibility of the Nexus platform means that the frequency can be set to meet specific user requirements.

It is generally helpful to group rules into logical categories. Typically rules perform a number of checks on the data and raise events when the checks fail. Currently rules that generate events generally also generate tasks. They can do this in different ways. For example a daily performance check rule might create a single task for every sector that fails any of the checks and wrap up all of the events that are generated for the sector into that single task. This has the advantage that it avoids duplication and keeps all of the performance information for each sector that exhibits an issue together in a single task. A configuration check rule on the other hand might do something similar for each area rather than for each sector. However it is also possible to group events into tasks in other ways or to create a separate task for each event.

Configuration check rules perform checks on network configuration data also called planning data which is stored in continuous attributes. Typically there are two types of configuration check rules 

Performance check rules perform tests on network performance data either by looking at the raw counters stored in discrete attributes or by looking at the KPIs that are generated from those counters. The flexibility of the Nexus Rules Engine is such that there is considerable scope for innovation in how you can implement performance check rules. However typically performance check rules look at a set of KPIs that cover the service as a whole using the industry standard approach of accessibility retention voice quality and capacity with the addition of further checks that aim to provide additional information to enable diagnosis and prioritization of issues.

Performance check rules are typically classified into two groups depending on the approach taken to the high level checks 

Design check rules perform checks on a combination of network configuration data and performance data.

Ad hoc rules can be used on an occasional or irregular basis to discover information about the state of the network e.g. when performing proactive optimization . These rules might simply be used to display information rather than creating events and tasks. They might be created on a temporary basis or stored for future use.

The system uses a powerful new expression language called the Actix Extensible Expression Language or AXEL. This has been developed to provide an easy way to configure the system. Because the system consolidates network operators processes into a single streamlined application and does not dictate what those processes should be each customer can have different attributes KPI calculations and rules for creating events and tasks. This means that the system needs a flexible and extensible mechanism for quickly and easily tailoring the system to meet each customer s specific requirements. All of the logic used within the system needs to be completely adaptable to match each customer s KPI definitions and processes. AXEL has been developed to answer this need. It is used throughout the system to define the formulas that are used for validating data and defining KPIs and the rules for generating performance alert and other events and for combining them into tasks.

AXEL enables the rules to be constructed independent of any specific data source it exposes a plug in API for interfacing with different data sources it supports code based and expression based function libraries. Furthermore new libraries can be written against the AXEL API and added to the product without recompiling the core system and users can write their own function libraries and save them as XML. These can then be used in exactly the same way as the built in functions. Users can also write custom implementations of core functions to extend or restrict functionality.

The above rule loops across all sectors and for every sector it uses the AXEL function FindNeighbourElements . For each neighbor element found a functions are called to count both incoming and outgoing handovers along the relationship definition over a period of time. The counts are summed and if found to be zero and task is then raised. The idea behind this rule is to identify neighbor relationships that were not being used and could therefore be removed.

As with the first example the above rule loops over all sectors for a predefined area in this case performing configuration checks. The rule looks at the radios on each sector using FindChildElements an example of traversing the network hierarchy. This rule is looking for radios that have changed their carrier number since yesterday and raises an event if it finds a change. The rule also looks for radios that have been added or deleted from the system. The aim is to provide an event layer on which correlation with other events can be performed in the rules engine and or simply provide context for engineer investigating a task.

The above example rule allows an engineer to compare the usage statistics of mobility between technology layers to determine if mobility relationships are missing between similar layers. The rule loops through all the sectors in one technology layer and finds a specified type of neighbor relationships in this instance 3G 2G . The rule then uses network hierarchy findparentelement to find the site and back down the hierarchy to find the equivalent GSM sector. Once the specified relationships are found for this sector 2G 2G in the example the two lists of neighbors are compared against common tuples. Where a relationship exists for the former layer but not for the later a check is made to see if the relationship is used and if so a message is written with supporting information to alert the engineer. This is a good example of an ad hoc rule and in this case the rule simply output the results to a text format.
