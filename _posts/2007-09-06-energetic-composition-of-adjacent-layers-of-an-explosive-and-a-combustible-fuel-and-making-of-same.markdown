The present invention generally relates to an energetic composition that may include adjacent layers of an explosive and a combustible fuel and making of the energetic composition. Specifically a layer of explosive may be deposited on a combustible fuel surface alternatively a combustible fuel layer may be deposited on a surface of an explosive layer to make the energetic composition. More specifically multiple layers of alternating explosive and combustible fuel layers may comprise the energetic composition.

 Energetic compositions may be used in a wide variety of applications e.g. propellants initiating materials gas generators and explosives. Formulations of energetic compositions may include one or more of the following explosives combustible fuels plasticizers binders oxidizers desensitizers etc. Typically conventional formulations of energetic compositions may then be mixed cast pressed and sometimes dried.

One of the primary goals in developing new energetic compositions is to increase the energy output. After mixing in the conventional formulation a particle of an explosive within the resultant mix may be separated from for example a particle of combustible fuel by intervening particles of binder or plasticizer. This separation of explosive from its fuel may decrease the energy output of the energetic composition when compared to an energetic composition in which an explosive is adjacent to its fuel.

An energetic composition may benefit greatly in increased energy output if an explosive is always adjacent to its fuel. The enhanced proximity of the explosive to its fuel may result in more complete consumption of the fuel providing increased energy output. Such an increased energy output may translate into significant weight reductions for an energetic composition used for example as a payload or propellant.

The energetic compound may also benefit from the absence of the formulating overhead of mixing casting pressing and drying if the enhanced proximity of the explosive to its fuel is accomplished by a vapor or physical deposition method similar to that used in electronic microchip fabrication.

Currently there is no known report of formulating an energetic composition by a vapor or physical deposition method that places an explosive adjacent to its fuel.

In addition to increasing the energy output of an energetic composition in which an explosive and its fuel may be deposited adjacent to one another recent understanding of the process by which initiation occurs in crystalline or polycrystalline explosives that are subject to shear induced plastic flow from shock or impact provides additional benefits from deposition methods in the making of the energetic composition. Plastic flow in crystals is due to the creation and motion of dislocations these dislocations distort the explosive molecules and this distortion and dislocated motion introduces micro shear bands. These micro shear bands are sites of heating melting sudden crystal failure and chemical reaction initiation.

It is expected that deposition of a combustible fuel layer adjacent to a crystalline or polycrystalline explosive layer would provide structural protection that may prevent accidental initiation from shock or impact by minimizing plastic flow of the crystal heat dissipation that prevents initiation by hot spots caused by micro shear bands and when the combustible fuel is a metal or metal alloy electrostatic discharge protection by neutralizing the electrical charge of the crystalline explosive.

It is further expected that precise control of the thickness of the deposited layers of explosive and fuel by vapor or physical deposition methods will allow optimization of energetic output for specific shapes and sizes of the energetic composition when used as either propellant or payload.

An exemplary embodiment of the present invention may include deposition of a precisely controlled thickness of an explosive layer on a surface of a combustible fuel. The explosive may comprise nitramines sometimes referred to as nitroamines for example 1 3 5 trinitro 1 3 5 triazinane RDX 1 3 5 7 tetranitroperhydro 1 3 5 7 tetrazocine HMX 2 4 6 8 10 12 hexanitro 2 4 6 8 10 12 hexaazaisowurtzitane CL 20 and other energetic compounds for example 2 methyl 1 3 5 trinitrobenzene TNT 2 4 6 trinitrophenyl N methlynitramine Tetryl 1 3 5 trinitro 2 2 2 4 6 trinitrophenyl ethenyl benzene HNS 3 nitro 1 2 4 triazol 5 one NTO 1 3 3 trinitroazetidine TNAZ nitroguanidine NQ 1 3 dinnitrato 2 2 bis nitratomethyl propane PETN ammonium dinitramide AND 1 3 5 triamino 2 4 6 trinitrobenzene TATB ammonium nitrate and ammonium perchlorate while the combustible fuel may comprise a metal or metal alloy including at least one of aluminum copper iron tungsten hafnium tantalum magnesium nickel sodium molybdenum and potassium or a non metal for example at least one of phosphorous and boron.

The deposition method may include for example chemical vapor deposition. The vapor deposition method may utilize an ultra high vacuum less than about 10Torr a high vacuum from about 10to about 10Torr a medium vacuum from about 10to about 10Torr a low vacuum from about 1 to about 10Torr an inert atmosphere including for example at least one of argon helium and nitrogen or a combination of a moderate vacuum with an inert atmosphere. The thickness of the vapor deposited layer of explosive may be controlled to about plus or minus 0.1 nm and may range from less than about 0.1 nm to about 100 m.

The vapor deposition of the explosive RDX onto a combustible metal surface of aluminum was accomplished in an ultra high vacuum UHV apparatus.

The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber with a working base pressure of 1 10Torr. The UHV chamber contained among other things a hemispherical analyzer used in concert with a dual Al Mg K X ray source for X ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS a quadrupole mass spectrometer for residual gas analysis a calibrated directed flux doser and two ZnSe windows to transmit light for infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy IRRAS . Vapor deposition thickness of the RDX was monitored with a quartz crystal microbalance and ranged from about a few nm to about 1000 nm.

The RDX vapor was introduced into the UHV chamber by differential pumping from a glass bulb containing RDX. The glass bulb was attached to the UHV chamber via a glass to metal seal. Regulation of the introduction of the RDX vapor was accomplished by use of an all metal Nupro valve and by heating of the glass bulb with an oil bath up to approximately 120 Celsius. Vapor deposition of the RDX in the ultra high vacuum environment prevented contamination of the energetic composition by HO O etc.

X ray photoelectron spectroscopy was invaluable in monitoring of surface modifications of RDX during deposition because of its ability to sample surface depths of less than about 3 nm.

Another aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may include vapor deposition or physical deposition that is sputtering of a combustible fuel layer for example aluminum onto a surface of a single crystal crystals or polycrystalline layer of an explosive for example 1 3 5 trinitro 1 3 5 triazinane RDX . The deposition method may utilize an ultra high vacuum less than about 10Torr a high vacuum from about 10to about 10Torr a medium vacuum from about 10to about 10Torr a low vacuum from about 1 to about 10Torr an inert atmosphere including for example at least one of argon helium and nitrogen or a combination of a vacuum with an inert atmosphere. The thickness of the deposited layer of combustible fuel may range from less than about 0.1 nm to about 100 m.

The vapor deposition of the combustible fuel aluminum onto an explosive surface of RDX was accomplished in an ultra high vacuum UHV apparatus.

The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber with a working base pressure of 1 10Torr. The UHV chamber contained among other things a hemispherical analyzer used in concert with a dual Al Mg KX ray source for X ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS a quadrupole mass spectrometer for residual gas analysis an ion sputter gun a calibrated directed flux doser an aluminum vapor doser and two ZnSe windows to transmit light for infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy IRRAS . Vapor deposition thickness of the aluminum layers was monitored with a quartz crystal microbalance and ranged from about 1 to about 0.10 nm.

The combustible metal vapor deposition was performed by heating an aluminum wire encapsulated within an alumina tube. The alumina tube was heated by applying electrical current through a tungsten filament wrapped around the tube. The aluminum vapor deposition was performed in situ to minimize environmental contamination by HO O etc. and thus prevented the deleterious formation of aluminum oxide.

The RDX samples were mounted onto a grounded translation stage with double sided conductive tape to minimize electrical charging.

Although the energetic composition may be formed in various geometric shapes it is contemplated that alternating disks of explosive and combustible fuel corresponding to the diameter of a projectile may be used for example as a propellant or a high energy payload.
