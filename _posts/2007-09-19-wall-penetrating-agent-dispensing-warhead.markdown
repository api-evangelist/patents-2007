title: Wall penetrating, agent dispensing warhead
abstract: A warhead includes a gas containing canister having a front end onto which is screwed a valve assembly having an interior which is in gas communication with the canister. A structure-penetrating nose connected onto the valve assembly. Positioned around a periphery of the valve assembly is a plurality of hollow frangible plugs. The nose includes a shoulder portion that shears the plugs upon impact with a target thus allowing gas within the canister and valve assembly to escape to an atmosphere.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention in general relates to warheads and more particularly to a warhead used to disable hostiles located within a structure.

In the field when hostiles are in a building or other similar structure there are several means of removing them. A common way is by means of teargas delivered via a gun. Tear gas canisters fired by a low power gun must be fired through a window. These devices are insufficient for firing through structures without windows. Another means of dealing with hostiles is via explosive warheads launched from a shoulder fired weapon or mounted weapon system. This means however is generally lethal to the hostiles and destructive to the building which may be of historical or tactical value.

It is an object of the invention to provide a warhead that is a non lethal and less destructive means of neutralizing hostiles.

A wall penetrating agent dispersing warhead is provided which includes a canister for containing a chemical dispersing agent and having a front end and a back end. A valve assembly is connected to the canister at the front end. The valve assembly has an open interior in gas communication with the contents of the canister. A plurality of frangible hollow shear plugs are threadedly connected to the valve assembly around the periphery thereof selected ones of the plugs being in gas communication with the open interior of the valve assembly. A structure penetrating nose is threadedly connected to the valve assembly. The nose has a shoulder portion proximate the plugs and operable to shear the plugs when the nose encounters a target. When the plugs are sheared gas within the interior of the valve assembly is released to the atmosphere via the sheared plugs.

Referring now to there is illustrated a warhead including a canister having a front end and a back end . A structure penetrating warhead nose is connected at the front end and a mass is connected at the back end . The mass is not a component of the invention but is added for test purposes to represent the flight weight of the expended rocket motor. The warhead may be fired from a rocket launcher or an air gun and if the latter the mass is provided to simulate the mass of a rocket motor.

A cutaway of the nose is illustrated in . Nose includes a conical section having a blunt tip . The conical section joins with a cylindrical section in a manner to define a lip or ridge . If the warhead hits a target at an angle the ridge will prevent the warhead from deflecting off the target such that it generally continues in the approximate impact orientation as it passes through a wall.

When the warhead strikes a target frangible threads may be sheared off and the nose may move backwards toward the canister such that a circumferential shoulder in an interior of the nose will shear frangible plugs and as well as the other plug not seen. When selected ones of the plugs are broken gas within canister is allowed to escape to the atmosphere. The gas path may be through the opening between the rear of the nose and the front end of the canister . In the event that this opening may be blocked there is provided an additional gas path in the form of gas channels which extend from the interior of the nose through the conical section to the atmosphere.

A more detailed view of the valve assembly may be seen in . The valve assembly includes threads that screw into the end of canister . The valve assembly has an interior that is in gas communication with the gaseous interior of the canister . This gas communication is via a hollow setscrew at the left end of valve assembly which is substantially adjacent the front end of the canister . An O ring or other type of seal is positioned between the end of canister and collar .

In the event that the valve assembly is unscrewed while the canister is still charged there is a possibility of a dangerous explosive detachment of the valve assembly from the canister . To prevent this event threads include an aperture that extends from the outside of valve assembly to its interior . If the valve assembly is prematurely unscrewed the pressure will be gently relieved once the aperture is past the end of canister preventing explosive detachment.

Another safety feature of the invention is the inclusion of a rupture disk located at the base of plug . If the gas pressure within canister becomes overpressurized rupture disk may rupture allowing gas to escape through gas channel in the head of plug and out a channel .

Canister may be filled with in an exemplary embodiment a dispersing agent such as tear gas or a combination of a liquid with a charging gas such as carbon dioxide. Exemplary liquids include malodorous liquids for example synthetic skunk oil or a marking agent. A gas may be introduced into canister by means of the valve assembly . More particularly the valve assembly includes a valve stem that at one end bears against a spring . The other end of valve stem normally bears against a seal and includes a rod that extends out of the valve assembly .

When the canister is to be filled with a gas and prior to the nose being attached a gas fixture not illustrated is screwed onto threads . The gas fixture depresses rod such that valve stem is disengaged from seal thus allowing charging gas to enter valve assembly and canister . Thereafter the gas fixture is removed and the nose applied.

In use the warhead is fired at a target and when it hits the target the force of impact causes threads to shear off. The nose is forced backwards relative to the canister such that shoulder ruptures all of the three frangible plugs. Taking plug as representative when it ruptures gas within the valve assembly exits to the atmosphere via the interior of the plug and through its ruptured portion by way of opening and or channels . Since plug includes the unbroken rupture disk no gas escapes through that plug even though it is ruptured.

Nose in an exemplary embodiment may be made of aluminum for example 2024 aluminum 7075 aluminum 2024 aluminum heat treated with Teflon impregnate or 7075 aluminum nickel plated with Teflon impregnate. Nose has a cylindrical section that has a diameter large enough to cover the frangible plugs. Another example of a nose material is heat treated steel one example of which is illustrated in .

The warhead of is identical to that previously described except that it has a nose of smaller diameter with a larger blunted tip . A cut away view is illustrated in . Due to the smaller diameter of the nose all of the plugs including plugs and are exposed. The outer cylindrical surface of nose terminates in a shoulder that is positioned and operative to rupture the plugs on impact with a target. When the plugs are ruptured gas within valve assembly is conducted directly to the atmosphere.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
