The present invention is related generally to an improved data processing system and in particular to a method and apparatus for processing digital video data. More particularly the present invention is directed to a computer implemented method apparatus and computer usable program product for presenting marketing disincentives to a customer based on a risk assessment score for the customer.

In the past merchants frequently had a personal relationship with their customers. The merchant often knew their customers names address marital status ages of their children hobbies place of employment character anniversaries birthdays likes dislikes and personal preferences. The merchant was able to use this information to cater to customer needs and push sales of items the customer might be likely to purchase based on the customer s personal situation. The merchant was also able to determine whether a customer was a good customer that should receive special marketing efforts a credit risk or bad customer that should not receive special marketing offers or a customer that posed a risk or threat to the store or other customers based on the merchant s personal knowledge of the customer s character reputation and criminal history.

However with the continued growth of large cities the corresponding disappearance of small rural towns and the increasing number of large impersonal chain stores with multiple employees the merchants and employees of retail businesses rarely recognize regular customers and almost never know the customer s name or any other details regarding their customer s personal preferences that might assist the merchant or employee in marketing efforts directed toward a particular customer.

One solution to this problem is directed toward using data mining techniques to gather customer profile data. The customer profile data is used to generate marketing strategies for marketing products to customers. Customer profile data typically includes information provided by the customer in response to a questionnaire or survey such as the name address telephone number and gender of customers as well as products preferred by the customer. Demographic data regarding a customer s age sex income career interests hobbies and consumer preferences may also be included in customer profile data.

However these methods only provide limited and generalized marketing strategies that are directed towards a fairly large segment of the population without taking into account actual customer reactions to product placement in a particular retail store or to other environmental factors that may influence product purchases by customers.

In an attempt to better monitor customers in large retail stores these stores frequently utilize cameras and other audio and or video monitoring devices to record customers inside the retail store or in the parking lot. A store detective may watch one or more monitors displaying closed circuit images of customers in various areas inside the store to identify shoplifters. However these solutions require a human user to review the audio and video recordings. In addition the video and audio recordings are typically used only for store security.

Thus current solutions do not utilize all of the potential dynamic customer data elements that may be available for identifying customers that should be marketed to customers that should be encouraged to shop at the retail facility customers that should not receive marketing content and customers that should be discouraged from shopping at the retail facility. The data elements currently being utilized to generate marketing strategies only provide approximately seventy five percent 75 of the needed customer data.

The illustrative embodiments provide a computer implemented method apparatus and computer usable program product for managing a level of marketing disincentives directed towards a customer using a risk assessment score. In one embodiment a risk assessment score for a customer associated with a retail facility is retrieved. The risk assessment score is analyzed to determine whether the customer is a desirable customer or an undesirable customer. In response to the risk assessment score indicating that the customer is an undesirable customer aggressive marketing disincentives targeted to the undesirable customer are generated. If the risk assessment score indicates the customer is a desirable customer marketing incentives targeted to the desirable customer are generated.

A motion detector may be implemented in any type of known or available motion detector device. A motion detector device may include but is not limited to one or more motion detector devices using a photo sensor radar or microwave radio detector or ultrasonic sound waves.

A motion detector using ultrasonic sound waves transmits or emits ultrasonic sound waves. The motion detector detects or measures the ultrasonic sound waves that are reflected back to the motion detector. If a human animal or other object moves within the range of the ultrasonic sound waves generated by the motion detector the motion detector detects a change in the echo of sound waves reflected back. This change in the echo indicates the presence of a human animal or other object moving within the range of the motion detector.

In one example a motion detector device using a radar or microwave radio detector may detect motion by sending out a burst of microwave radio energy and detecting the same microwave radio waves when the radio waves are deflected back to the motion detector. If a human animal or other object moves into the range of the microwave radio energy field generated by the motion detector the amount of energy reflected back to the motion detector is changed. The motion detector identifies this change in reflected energy as an indication of the presence of a human animal or other object moving within the motion detectors range.

A motion detector device using a photo sensor detects motion by sending a beam of light across a space into a photo sensor. The photo sensor detects when a human animal or object breaks or interrupts the beam of light as the human animal or object by moving in between the source of the beam of light and the photo sensor. These examples of motion detectors are presented for illustrative purposes only. A motion detector in accordance with the illustrative embodiments may include any type of known or available motion detector and is not limited to the motion detectors described herein.

A pressure sensor detector may be for example a device for detecting a change in weight or mass associated with the pressure sensor. For example if one or more pressure sensors are imbedded in a sidewalk Astroturf or floor mat the pressure sensor detects a change in weight or mass when a human customer or animal steps on the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor may also detect when a human customer or animal steps off of the pressure sensor. In another example one or more pressure sensors are embedded in a parking lot and the pressure sensors detect a weight and or mass associated with a vehicle when the vehicle is in contact with the pressure sensor. A vehicle may be in contact with one or more pressure sensors when the vehicle is driving over one or more pressure sensors and or when a vehicle is parked on top of one or more pressure sensors.

Other items of merchandise may be for sale such as without limitation food beverages shoes clothing household goods decorative items or sporting goods may be hung from display racks displayed in cabinets on shelves or in refrigeration units not shown . Any other type of merchandise display arrangement known in the retail trade may also be used in accordance with the illustrative embodiments. For example display shelves or racks may include in addition to retail items various advertising displays images or postings.

Retail items may be viewed or identified by the illustrative embodiments using an image capture device or other detector in set of detectors . To facilitate identification items may have attached identification tags . Identification tags are tags associated with one or more retail items for identifying the item and or location of the item. For example identification tags may be without limitation a bar code pattern such as a universal product code UPC or European article number EAN a radio frequency identification RFID tag or other optical identification tag depending on the capabilities of the image capture device and associated data processing system to process the information and make an identification of retail items . In some embodiments an optical identification may be attached to more than one side of a given item.

Biometric device is a device coupled or mounted to container for gathering biometric readings associated with the customer using container .

The data processing system discussed in greater detail in below includes associated memory which may be an integral part such as the operating memory of the data processing system or externally accessible memory. Software for tracking objects may reside in the memory and run on the processor. The software is capable of tracking retail items as a customer removes an item in retail items from its display position and places the item into container . Likewise the tracking software can track items which are being removed from container and placed elsewhere in the retail store whether placed back in their original display position or anywhere else including into another container. The tracking software can also track the position of container and the customer.

The software can track retail items by using data from one or more of detectors located externally to retail facility internal data captured by one or more detectors in set of detectors located internally to retail facility such as identification data received from identification tags and or identification data received from identification tag .

The software in the data processing system keeps a list of which items have been placed in each shopping container such as container . The list is stored in a database such as without limitation a spreadsheet relational database hierarchical database or the like. The database may be stored in the operating memory of the data processing system externally on a secondary data storage device locally on a recordable medium such as a hard drive floppy drive CD ROM DVD device remotely on a storage area network such as storage area network in or in any other type of storage device.

The lists of items in container are updated frequently enough to maintain a dynamic accurate real time listing of the contents of each container as customers add and remove items from containers such as container . The listings of items in containers are also made available to whatever inventory system is used in retail facility . Such listings represent an up to the minute view of which items are still available for sale for example to on line shopping customers or customers physically located at retail facility . The listings may also provide a demand side trigger back to the supplier of each item. In other words the listing of items in customer shopping containers can be used to update inventories determine current stock available for sale to customers and or identification of items that need to be restocked or replenished.

At any time the customer using container may request to see a listing of the contents of container by entering a query at a user interface to the data processing system. The user interface may be available at a kiosk computer personal digital assistant or other computing device connected to the data processing system via a network connection. The user interface may also be coupled to a display device such as at a display device in display devices display devices or display device associated with container . The customer may also make such a query after leaving the retail store. For example a query may be made using a portable device or a home computer workstation.

The listing is then displayed at a location where it may be viewed by the customer on a display device. The listing may include the quantity of each item in container as well as the brand price of each item discount or amount saved off the regular price of each item and a total price for all items in container . Other data may also be displayed as part of the listing such as additional incentives to purchase one or more other items.

When the customer is finished shopping the customer may proceed to a point of sale checkout station. The checkout station may be coupled to the data processing system in which case the items in container are already known to the data processing system due to the dynamic listing of items in container that is maintained as the customer shops in digital customer marketing environment . Thus there is no need for an employee customer or other person to scan each item in container to complete the purchase of each item as is commonly done today. In this example the customer merely arranges for payment of the total for example by use of a smart card credit card debit card cash or other payment method. In some embodiments it may not be necessary to empty container at the retail facility at all if container is a minimal cost item which can be kept by the customer.

In other embodiments container belongs to the customer. The customer brings container to retail facility at the start of the shopping session. In another embodiment container belongs to retail facility and must be returned before the customer leaves digital customer marketing environment .

In another example when the customer is finished shopping the customer may complete checkout either in aisle or from a final or terminal based checkout position in the store using a transactional device which may be integral with container or associated temporarily to container . The customer may also complete the transaction using a consumer owned computing device such as a laptop cellular telephone or personal digital assistant that is connected to the data processing system via a network connection.

The customer may also make payment by swiping a magnetic strip on a card using any known or available radio frequency identification RFID enabled payment device or using a biometric device for identifying the customer by the customer s fingerprint voiceprint thumbprint and or retinal pattern. In such as case the customer s account is automatically charged after the customer is identified.

The transactional device may also be a portable device such as a laptop computer palm device or any other portable device specially configured for such in aisle checkout service whether integral with container or separately operable. In this example the transactional device connects to the data processing system via a network connection to complete the purchase transaction at check out time.

Checkout may be performed in aisle or at the end of the shopping trip whether from any point or from a specified point of transaction. As noted above checkout transactional devices may be stationary shared devices or portable or mobile devices offered to the customer from the store or may be devices brought to the store by the customer which are compatible with the data processing system and software residing on the data processing system.

Set of speakers is a set of one or more speakers in a sound system. Set of speakers are used to create an ambiance in retail facility by performing acts such as without limitation playing subliminal messages over a sound system wherein the subliminal messages encourage the undesirable customer to leave the retail facility playing music over a sound system to encourage the undesirable customer to leave playing music designed to soothe or relax a customer or other actions.

Set of lights is a set of one or more lights in retail facility . Set of lights are used to create an ambiance by performing actions such as but not limited to shining bright lights in an area of the retail facility occupied by the undesirable customer shining red lights flashing lights softening a lighting level to create a more relaxed or soothing atmosphere or other actions.

Thus in this depicted example when a customer enters digital customer marketing environment but before the customer enters retail facility such as a retail store the customer is detected and identified by one or more detectors in detectors to generate external data. The customer identification may be an exact identification of the customer by name identification by an identifier or an anonymous identification that is used to track the customer even though the customer s exact name and identity is not known. If the customer takes a shopping container before entering retail facility the shopping container is also identified. In some embodiments the customer may be identified through identification of container .

An analysis server in a data processing system associated with retail facility begins performing data mining on available static customer data such as but not limited to customer profile information and demographic information for use in generating customized marketing messages targeted to the customer. In one embodiment the customer is presented with customized digital marketing messages on one or more display devices in display devices located externally to retail facility before the customer enters retail facility .

The customer is tracked using image data and or other detection data captured by detectors as the customer enters retail facility . The customer is identified and tracked inside retail facility by one or more detectors inside the facility such as set of detectors .

When the customer enters retail facility the customer is typically offered provided or permitted to take shopping container for use during shopping.

When the customer takes a shopping container such as container the analysis server uses data from set of detectors such as identification data from identification tags and to track container and items selected by the customer and placed in container .

As a result an item selected by the customer for example as the customer removes the item from its stationary position on a store display is identified. The selected item may be traced visually by a camera tracked by another type of detector in set of detectors and or using identification data from identification tags . The item is tracked until the customer places it in container to form a selected item.

Thus a selected item is identified when a customer removes an item from a store display such as a shelf display counter basket or hanger. In another embodiment the selected item is identified when the customer places the item in the customer s shopping basket shopping bag or shopping cart.

Container may contain a digital media display such as display device mounted on container and or customer may be offered a handheld digital media display device such as a display device in display devices . In the alternative the customer may be encouraged to use strategically placed kiosks running digital media marketing messages throughout retail facility . Display device and or may include a verification device for verifying an identity of the customer.

For example display device may include a radio frequency identification tag reader for reading a radio frequency identification tag a smart card reader for reading a smart card or a card reader for reading a specialized store loyalty or frequent customer card. Once the customer has been verified the data processing system retrieves past purchase history total potential wallet share shopper segmentation information customer profile data granular demographic data for the customer and or any other available customer data elements using known or available data retrieval and or data mining techniques. These customer data elements are analyzed using at least one data model to determine appropriate digital media content to be pushed on demand throughout the store to customers viewing display devices and or display device .

The customer is provided with incentives to use display devices and or display device to obtain marketing incentives promotional offers and discounts for items. When the customer has finished shopping the customer may be provided with a list of savings or tiered accounting of savings over the regular price of purchased items if a display device had not been used to view and use customized digital marketing messages.

In this example a single container and a single customer is described. However the aspects of the illustrative embodiments may also be used to track multiple containers and multiple customers simultaneously. In this case the analysis server will store a separate listing of selected items for each active customer. As noted above the listings may be stored in a database. The listing of items in a given container is displayed to a customer employee agent or other customer in response to a query. The listing may be displayed to a customer at any time either while actively shopping during check out or after the customer leaves retail facility .

This process provides an intelligent guided selling methodology to optimize customer throughput in the store thereby maximizing or optimizing total retail content and or retail sales profit and or revenue for retail facility . It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the words optimize optimization and related terms are terms of art that refer to improvements in speed and or efficiency of a computer program and do not purport to indicate that a computer program has achieved or is capable of achieving an optimal or perfectly speedy perfectly efficient state.

Next is a block diagram of a data processing system in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Data processing system is an example of a computer such as server or client in in which computer usable code or instructions implementing the processes may be located for the illustrative embodiments. In this example data is transmitted from data processing system to the retail facility over a network such as network in . In another embodiment data processing system is located on site at the retail facility.

In the depicted example data processing system employs a hub architecture including a north bridge and memory controller hub MCH and a south bridge and input output I O controller hub ICH . Processing unit main memory and graphics processor are coupled to north bridge and memory controller hub .

In the illustrative embodiments a global profile includes data on the customer s interests preferences and affiliations. The profiled past may also comprise retrieving purchased data. Various firms provide data for purchase which is grouped or keyed to presenting a lifestyle or life stage view of customers by block or group or some other baseline parameter. The purchased data presents a view of one or more customers based on aggregation of data points such as but not limited to geographic block age of head of household income level number of children education level ethnicity and purchasing patterns.

The profiled past may also include navigational data relating to the path the customer used to arrive at a web page which indicates where the customer came from or the path the customer followed to link to the merchant or supplier s web page. Transactional data of actions taken is data regarding a transaction. For example transaction data may include data regarding whether the transaction is a first time transaction or a repeat transaction and or how much the customer usually spends. Information on how much a customer generally spends during a given transaction may be referred to as basket share. Data voluntarily submitted by the customer in responding to questions or a survey may also be included in the profiled past.

Current actions also called a current and historical record are also included in profile data . Current actions are data defining customer behavior. One source of current actions is listings of the purchases made by the customer payments and returns made by the customer and or click stream data from a point of contact device of the customer. Click stream data is data regarding a customer s navigation of an online web page of the merchant or supplier. Click stream data may include page hits sequence of hits duration of page views response to advertisements transactions made and conversion rates. Conversion rate is the number of times the customer takes action divided by the number of times an opportunity is presented.

In this example profiled past data for a given customer is stored in analysis server .

The biometric data is data describing a set of physiological responses of the customer.

Biometric readings associated with the customer that are captured by the biometric device s are analyzed by analysis server to identify biometric readings that exceed a threshold change to form biometric data . If the customer was viewing an item or a marketing message when the change in the biometric reading occurred analysis server associates the change in the biometric reading with the item or the marketing message to form biometric data . If the customer was interacting with another customer an employee of the retail facility a child or an animal analysis server associates the change in the biometric reading with the another customer the employee the child or the animal to form biometric data .

Threshold is a threshold risk assessment score that is used to determine when risk assessment score indicates a customer poses a potential threat to the store. The potential threat posed by the customer to the retail facility includes but is not limited to a risk of the customer shoplifting stealing from other customers or employees committing theft from the store or other customers committing violence on employees other customers or self inflicted violence failing to pay bills defaulting on loans disrupting operations of the retail facility criminal activities threatening customers panhandling and loitering.

Risk assessment engine is software for performing a risk assessment analysis of a customer. In this example analysis server parses dynamic data associated with a customer to identify patterns of events. Dynamic data includes metadata describing an appearance and behavior of the customer. Risk assessment engine analyzes the patterns of events to identify risk assessment factors for the customer. Risk assessment engine performs a risk assessment analysis using the risk assessment factors for the customer to generate risk assessment score for the customer. Risk assessment score is a ranking that indicates a potential risk posed by the customer to the retail facility. A different risk assessment score is generated for each customer.

Risk assessment engine also retrieves a customer profile for the customer. The customer profile includes static customer data elements describing the customer such as but not limited to the customer s criminal record credit rating past incidents in the retail store and other details regarding the customer s past actions and record. Risk assessment engine analyzes dynamic data and biometric data with the customer profile data to identify the risk assessment factors for the customer.

In another embodiment risk assessment engine analyzes the risk assessment factors using at least one of a statistical method a data mining method and pre generated manual input to generate weighted risk factors. Risk assessment engine generates risk assessment score using the weighted risk assessment factors and cohort data for the customer. Cohort data is data describing the customer such as the customer s appearance and behavior. The cohort data may describe the customer as wearing a trench coat in warm weather or wearing sunglasses indoors.

If dynamic data includes grouping data that indicates the customer is shopping with one or more other people or animals risk assessment score is generated for each member of the group. Grouping data for the customer describes a group associated with the customer. The group may be for example a group of parents with children teenagers children minors unaccompanied by adults minors accompanied by adults grandparents with grandchildren senior citizens couples friends coworkers a customer shopping with a pet a customer with a large dog a customer with an unrestrained animal and a customer shopping alone.

If risk assessment score for the customer is greater than threshold risk assessment engine identifies the customer as an undesirable customer that may pose a potential threat to the store. In response risk assessment engine initiates aggressive marketing disincentives targeted towards to the undesirable customer. Aggressive marketing disincentives are marketing initiatives intended to decrease an amount of time the customer spends shopping in the retail facility. The aggressive disincentives include without limitation informing a set of employees associated with the retail facility that the customer is an undesirable customer and directing the set of employees to avoid offering assistance unless assistance is requested by the customer providing disincentive marketing messages to the customer that include uncompetitive product pricing and undesirable product offers and creating a negative ambiance in an area of the retail facility associated with the customer. Creating a negative ambiance further comprises shining harsh or bright lights in an area of the retail facility occupied by the customer playing subliminal messages over a sound system that encourage or prompt the customer to leave the retail facility playing music over a sound system wherein the music is designed to encourage the customer to feel uncomfortable and or adjusting a temperature in an area of the retail facility to an uncomfortable temperature wherein an uncomfortable temperature is at least one of a temperature that is colder than a predetermined temperature higher than a predetermined comfortable temperature and a humidity that is higher than a predetermined comfortable humidity level.

If risk assessment score indicates the customer is a highly desirable customer risk assessment engine initiates marketing incentives targeted towards the customer. The marketing incentives include without limitation notifying an employee associated with the retail facility to assist the customer and generating customized marketing messages for the customer that include competitive product pricing and preferred product offers. A display device may also be provided to the customer that provides a map and or locations of items in the retail facility to improve a shopping experience of the customer.

If risk assessment score indicates the customer is a neutral or moderately desirable customer risk assessment engine initiates moderate marketing efforts directed towards the customer that are cheaper to generate and present to the customer than aggressive marketing incentives.

Biometric device is any type of known or available device for measuring a physiological response or trait associated with a customer. Biometric device is a biometric device such as without limitation biometric device in . Biometric device may be a biometric device for measuring a customer s heart rate over a given period of time a change in voice stress for the customer s voice a change in blood pressure and or a change in pupil dilation that does not correlate or correspond to a change in an ambient lighting level.

In this example biometric device is coupled to shopping container . Biometric device monitors biometric readings of a customer and detects changes in the biometric readings of the customer that exceeds a threshold change. In this example biometric device is a device for measuring a customer s heart rate over time. Biometric device obtains the customer s pulse rate by measuring the customer s finger pulse.

In another embodiment biometric device may also identify a customer based on a fingerprint scan voiceprint analysis and or retinal scan. For example biometric device may dynamically identify the customer by scanning the customer s fingerprint and or analyzing fingerprint data associated with the customer to determine the customer s identity. In one example biometric device may but is not required to connected to a remote data storage device storing data to retrieve customer fingerprint data for use in identifying a given customer using the customer s fingerprint. Biometric device may be connected to the remote data storage device via a wireless network connection such as network in .

In this example biometric device is coupled attached or imbedded in a handle of shopping container . However biometric device may be coupled attached or imbedded in or on any part or member of shopping container .

In another embodiment biometric device is coupled attached associated with or imbedded within display device . In this example display device may use biometric device to dynamically identifying the customer by scanning the customer s fingerprint and or analyzing data associated with the customer s fingerprint to determine the customer s identity.

Risk assessment factors could also include additional factors not shown in such as number of items returned number of service calls made number of items exchanged number of children brought into the retail facility during shopping trips number of civil lawsuits filed against retail facilities history of frivolous lawsuits filed against businesses liens against the customer s property a history of lawsuits against the retail facility that were settled out of court and any other factors that could indicate whether a customer is a desirable customer or a customer that poses a potential risk or threat to the store.

Risk assessment engine generates risk assessment factors based on a customer profile such as profile data in credit history and credit rating bankruptcy filings civil and criminal lawsuits data regarding the customer s past purchases exchanges and returns criminal records court records and other publicly available information regarding the customer.

Risk assessment engine processes risk assessment factors in derived model to generate weighted risk assessment factors . Derived model processes risk assessment factors using at least one of a statistical method a data mining method and or pre generated manual input from users to generate weighted risk assessment factors . Weighted risk assessment factors take into account the fact that some risk factors are more important than others. For example if a customer has a history of shoplifting this factor is of more importance than a risk factor that indicates the customer makes frequent customer complaints.

Weighted risk assessment factors are processed with cohort data to generate weighted risk assessment score . Cohort data is data describing the customer such as the customer s appearance and behavior. The cohort data may describe the customer as wearing a trench coat in warm weather or wearing sunglasses indoors. Cohort data may also include data describing behavior of the customer such as without limitation walking fast walking slowly carrying a large bag loitering pacing or any other behaviors and or behavior patterns of the customer. Cohort data may also include profile data for the customer such as profile data in .

Turning now to a flowchart illustrating a process for monitoring for a change in biometric readings associated with a customer is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The process may be implemented by a device for measuring physiological responses and or traits of a customer such as biometric devices in and or biometric device in .

The process begins by monitoring biometric readings of a customer obtained from a set of one or more biometric devices step . The process makes a determination as to whether a change in the biometric readings that exceeds a threshold change has been detected step . If a change exceeding the threshold is not detected the process terminates thereafter.

Returning to step if a change exceeding the threshold is detected the process makes a determination as to whether the customer was viewing an item a marketing message or some other identifiable person place or thing when the change in biometric readings occurred step . If the customer was not viewing an item a marketing message or some other identifiable person place or thing the process terminates thereafter.

Returning to step if the customer was viewing an item marketing message or something else identifiable the process associates the change in biometric reading with the item the marketing message or the identifiable person place or thing to form the biometric data step . The process transmits the biometric data to an analysis server and or stores the biometric data in a data storage device for later use in generating customized marketing messages in the future step with the process terminating thereafter.

The process generates a risk assessment score for the customer based on the results of the risk assessment analysis step . The process makes a determination as to whether the risk assessment score indicates the customer is a desirable customer step . If the customer is a desirable customer the process generates marketing incentives targeted to the customer step with the process terminating thereafter. If the customer is not a desirable customer the process generates marketing disincentives step with the process terminating thereafter.

If the score is not available at step the process generates a risk assessment score using dynamic data for the customer and or biometric data step . The process stores the risk assessment score in a customer profile for the customer step .

The process makes a determination as to whether new dynamic data and or new biometric data for the customer is available step . If new dynamic data and or biometric data is not available the process terminates thereafter. If new data is available the process performs a risk assessment analysis on the new dynamic data and or biometric data step . The process updates the risk assessment score using the results of the risk assessment analysis step with the process terminating thereafter.

Returning to step if the score is not greater than the upper threshold the process makes a determination as to whether the risk assessment score is lower than a lower threshold score step . If the score is lower than the lower threshold the process identifies the customer as a highly desirable customer step and initiates aggressive marketing incentives targeted to the customer step with the process terminating thereafter.

Returning to step if the risk assessment score is lower than the upper threshold and higher than the lower threshold the process identifies the customer as a moderately desirable average customer step . The process initiates moderate marketing incentives targeted to the customer step with the process terminating thereafter.

In another embodiment a customer is identified as an undesirable customer is the risk assessment score is lower than a lower threshold. In this case a customer is identified as a desirable customer if the risk assessment score is greater than an upper threshold. In other words any type of scoring method and threshold may be used to identify customers that are more likely to cause a risk of financial losses and or legal problems for the retail facility than other customers.

If marketing disincentives are not initiated the process generates customized marketing messages including competitive or desirable product pricing and product offers step and directs sales associates to focus customer assistance efforts towards the customer step with the process terminating thereafter.

The process begins by retrieving any available dynamic data for a customer step . The dynamic data includes without limitation grouping data external data customer identification data vehicle identification data customer behavior data and or any other dynamic customer data elements. The process retrieves any available biometric data step for the customer.

The process pre generates or creates in advance appropriate data models using at least one of a statistical method data mining method causal model mathematical model marketing model behavioral model psychographical model sociological model simulations modeling techniques and or any combination of models data mining statistical methods simulations and or modeling techniques step . The process analyzes dynamic data using one or more of the appropriate data models to identify a set of personalized marketing message criteria step . The set of personalized marketing message criteria may include one or more criterion for generating a personalized marketing message.

The process makes a determination as to whether to initiate marketing disincentives directed towards the customer step . If marketing disincentives are not initiated the process dynamically builds a set of one or more customized marketing messages using the personalized marketing message criteria and marketing incentives step . If marketing disincentives are initiated the process dynamically builds a set of one or more customized marketing messages using the personalized marketing message criteria and marketing disincentives step . The process then transmits the set of customized marketing messages to a display device associated with the customer step for presentation of the marketing message to the customer with the process terminating thereafter.

Thus the illustrative embodiments provide a computer implemented method apparatus and computer program product for managing a level of marketing disincentives directed towards a customer using a risk assessment score. In one embodiment a risk assessment score for a customer associated with a retail facility is retrieved. The risk assessment score is analyzed to determine whether the customer is a desirable customer or an undesirable customer. In response to the risk assessment score indicating that the customer is an undesirable customer aggressive marketing disincentives targeted to the undesirable customer are generated. If the risk assessment score indicates the customer is a desirable customer marketing incentives targeted to the desirable customer are generated.
