East Asian EA language system is a complex system with a huge character set in comparison with the Latin letters. Taking Chinese for example there are totally over 20 000 single characters. A recognition system with isolated models for each single character would be huge and include many redundant parameters. Implementation of a recognition system with isolated models on a handheld device would require significant resources to operate in a timely efficient manner. Thus a need exists for techniques to simplify recognition of EA characters.

Exemplary techniques are described for selecting radical sets for use in probabilistic East Asian character recognition algorithms. An exemplary technique includes applying a decomposition rule to each East Asian character of the set to generate a progressive splitting graph where the progressive splitting graph comprises radicals as nodes formulating an optimization problem to find an optimal set of radicals to represent the set of East Asian characters using maximum likelihood and minimum description length and solving the optimization problem for the optimal set of radicals. Another exemplary technique includes selecting an optimal set of radicals by using a general function that characterizes a radical with respect to other East Asian characters and a complex function that characterizes complexity of a radical.

As mentioned in the Background section a need exists for more efficient character recognition systems especially for East Asian EA characters e.g. Chinese Japanese Korean or the like . Two approaches to enhance efficiency of character recognition are described herein and referred to as i a progressive splitting graph PSG technique and ii as a generality complexity G C technique. In general an exemplary character recognition system will use one or the other technique to determine an optimal radical set that can represent a set of EA characters. However where desired an exemplary character recognition system may include use of a radical set selected using the PSG and a radical set selected using the G C technique. During development of a character recognition system a developer may test radicals sets determined through use of a PSG technique and through use of a G C technique and then select the most appropriate set e.g. for a given use . In general the exemplary techniques presented herein are suitable for use in character recognition systems that rely on probabilistic models such as the Hidden Markov Model HMM . In particular radicals in an optimal radical set can be nodes for a HMM or possibly other types of probabilistic models e.g. Bayesian models etc. .

The PSG technique as the name implies uses a progressive splitting graph and layers to organize and optimize radicals that can represent EA characters. The G C technique uses local generality and complexity measures to characterize radicals that represent an EA character and then uses a global optimization to select radicals to represent a set of EA characters.

An exemplary method may include providing a set of East Asian characters applying a decomposition rule to each East Asian character of the set to generate a progressive splitting graph where the progressive splitting graph comprises radicals as nodes formulating an optimization problem to find an optimal set of radicals to represent the set of East Asian characters using maximum likelihood and minimum description length solving the optimization problem for the optimal set of radicals and using the optimal set of radicals in a Hidden Markov Model based character recognition algorithm.

An exemplary method may include providing a set of East Asian characters for each East Asian character of the set forming one or more sets of radicals and determining a value for each set of radicals based at least in part on a general function that characterizes a radical with respect to other East Asian characters of the set of East Asian characters and a complex function that characterizes complexity of a radical. According to such a method for each East Asian character the method may include selecting the set of radicals that comprises the largest value determining an optimal set of radicals based on the selected sets of radicals for the set of East Asian characters and using the optimal set of radicals in a Hidden Markov Model based character recognition algorithm.

Details of the two aforementioned examples the former a PSG example and the latter a G C example may be understood in more detail with reference to .

Per the PSGs of every character is split to several radical candidates and then the radical candidates are recursively split until strokes. Such splitting relationships are represented by directed arcs. Per the condition of complete assertion given a radical set L in a PSG graph the radical set L is complete if all characters can be represented by the composition of members in L. The complete assertion condition is satisfies that L is complete if and only if for each path P from a character node L to a stroke node L in the PSG graph L P . A complete radical set is a radical layer noted by Las the shaded region shows in again where the character set and stroke set are both radical layers noted by Land L respectively.

With respect to the radical graph conditions the radical graph is denoted as G R D where R is the radical set and D is the direct decomposition rule set for decomposition of radicals e.g. a character radical or other non stroke radical . A direct decomposition rule d for decomposition of radicals e.g. d belongs to the set D can be represented as d r s where ris within the set R and where sis belongs to the set R. The rule indicates that rcan be decomposed to a sequence composed of d radicals S . . . S . Obviously by applying direct decompositions iteratively a series of decompositions of a radical can be obtained or generated. In r s denotes that r can be decomposed to s directly or indirectly. Further as indicated in given two radicals u and v as members of the set R if there exists a rule d as a member of the set D satisfying r u and v belonging to the set s then v is called a child of u. The set of all the children of u is denoted as F u .

Thus according to the method given a radical set members of the set can be decomposed or merged based upon a radical graph to maximize a certain criterion. An input radical set is termed the initial set and represented as I as contained within the set R see block . To facilitate representation the concept of a representative set is introduced. Given a radical graph G and a radical set U within R if every member of r within the set U there exists s that satisfies the condition that r can be decomposed to s and s is within the set V then U can be represented with V.

As shown in block of the method based upon the notations the problem of optimal radical selection can be formulized as max where C is the criterion to be defined. In a conventional training process for HMMs maximum likelihood is widely adopted. As an example to demonstrate the PSG approach the criterion C is defined based on maximum likelihood ML .

In a criterion block a penalty is introduced to penalize model complexity. In other words considering that the numbers of parameters can be different with respect to a particular radical set model complexity should be penalized. In the example of the criterion of minimum description length MDL is adopted. The resulting criterion C V then includes a probability density function PDF component and a penalty component. The probability density function component includes a term p for the empirical distribution of data. In the block the symbol represents the parameter set for the HMMs see discussion of Habove . As explained in the block the penalty function MDL includes a parameter K that represents the number of parameters in the HMMs and a parameter T which is the number of training samples as well as a parameter d as a feature dimension parameter.

The method uses a layer approach to simplify searching for an optimal radical set. A definition block defines layers as including a base layer and a terminal layer with at least one intermediate layer between the base layer and the terminal layer. For example the base layer may be an EA character layer while the terminal layer may be a stroke layer see e.g. PSG of . Various criteria are shown using formalized mathematical representations for such a layer scheme. In these formulas Lrepresents the active set in set L radical layers from Lto L . Each element in Lshould be a non sink radical e.g. a non terminal radical and for each element all the element s parents should not be in the active set L. Thus for example each element in the active set Lshould have children and no parent child or ancestor child pair exists in the active set L. The physical meaning of a step of layer evolution is to decompose all the radicals except those children of other radicals in the current layer. In general every layer Lof is a representative set of L. The layer sequence can generally describe the radical decomposition process and the number of layers can be a relatively small number e.g. on the order of approximately 10 . Hence re training of the models for each layer can readily occur to obtain likelihoods. Block of the exemplary method of shows a formulation of an optimization problem for the optimal layer. As indicated by block by taking a layer approach that considers layers as opposed to individual radicals etc. optimization can occur to find the best layer index. As described herein the best layer can be used in a character recognition system for character recognition.

As mentioned two techniques are described herein for selection of a set of radicals for character recognition. pertain generally to a PSG technique while pertain generally to a G C technique. shows an exemplary method for selection of a radical set that includes use of generality and complexity measures i.e. G C technique.

According to the G C technique each single EA character may have multiple representations. For example an EA character may be represented by radicals rand ras well as by radicals r rand r. The G C approach can set forth optimized representations for each EA character and summarize representation rules to form an optimum radical set.

To establish the representing optimization problem for a EA single character two measurement functions are defined as indicated in block 

Complex r measures the complexity of a radical r which may be the sub stroke number of the radical or other complexity measure 

General r measures the generality of a radical r which may be the number of characters containing the radical or other generality measure. Block further includes a measure which is the number of radicals in a radical set. Further weights may be assigned for example for use in a pre determined function see e.g. function of block . Such weights may be optimized adjusted or otherwise selected based on character recognition trials or one or more other criteria. The General function may operate using the Simplified Chinese GB0 character set which includes 3755 characters. Where other character sets are used the General function may be different or otherwise adapted to accommodate the selected character set. Further one or more weights may be adjusted accordingly.

Per the block a single representing rule R not to be confused with the radical set R of the PSG technique includes a set of radicals i.e. R r r . . . r . Per block a function F R is provided to compute a value for each radical set for each character. In the example of the function F R includes three weights which appear as the weights in the block . Once function values are determined for each radical set for a particular EA character then a selection block can select the set with the maximum function value R . In turn by summarizing the optimized representing rules of all characters an optimal overall or global radical set may be determined.

The global process of the method includes a summarization block that summarizes optimized representing rules for all of the characters processed according to the local process e.g. blocks . Then an optimal radial set is selected in a selection block to represent all characters of the character set. For example a process may picture out the optimized representations for each character and summarize the representation rules to form the optimal radical set. Such a radical set can then be used in any of a variety of character recognition systems. For example the radical set selected by the block may be used in character recognition system that uses one or more HMMs.

While various examples refer to Chinese language characters an exemplary PSG technique and or an exemplary G C technique may be used for a character set associated with a language such as Chinese Japanese Korean and the like. Hence an optimal radical set may be suitable for use with a character recognition algorithm or system that provides for recognition of characters associated with Chinese Japanese Korean or other languages. An exemplary character recognition system may be configured to recognize characters from one or more character sets.
