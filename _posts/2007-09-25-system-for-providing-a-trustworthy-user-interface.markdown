title: System for providing a trustworthy user interface
abstract: The preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a computer system which employs a trusted display processor (), which has a trusted processor () and trusted memory () physically and functionally distinct from the processor and memory of the computer system. The trusted display processor () is immune to unauthorised modification or inspection of internal data. It is physical to prevent forgery, tamper-resistant to prevent counterfeiting, and has crypto functions () to securely communicate at a distance. The trusted display processor () interacts with a user's smartcard () in order to extract and display a trusted image, or seal (), generate a digital signature of the bitmap of a document image and control the video memory () so that other processes of the computer system cannot subvert the image during the signing process. The user interacts with the trusted display processor via a trusted switch ().
