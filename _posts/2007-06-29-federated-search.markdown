In the course of day to day work users often need to access information stored in various content repositories such as line of business applications on line newspapers and web based research sites. Finding the information stored in these content repositories involves searching multiple applications and sites generally by loading a web page or an application associated with the desired information performing a search and then repeating this process for each content repository.

Web search sites index web pages to facilitate searching but not all sites can be indexed with this method. For example subscription sites may allow queries but not indexing and many on line stores that dynamically build product information pages from information in databases cannot be indexed although they may be searched.

The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure and it does not identify key critical elements of the invention or delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts disclosed herein in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

In accordance with one implementation presented herein software such as an operating system based search application herein known as originating software running on a client computer allows a selection from a set of content repositories or locations to be searched. The originating software parses a query may modify the content and syntax of the query to match the requirements for each of the selected locations and submit queries to each of the locations through an appropriate programmatic interface such as WebDAV adding a query to a URL or the like. Each of the locations then performs a search and returns the results to the originating software. A user interface is provided allowing the returned results from each of the locations to be displayed. Some implementations allow for any number of different search applications to send queries to any number of locations.

Not all locations may allow all originating software to query them directly. For example to enhance security an enterprise may only allow certain servers and services such as a particular intranet search portal access to an authorization and authentication server that grants access to a particular location such as a human resources database search engine. In an example an intranet search portal may be allowed to search a particular location but an operating system based search application may not be allowed to search the particular location.

Some implementations described herein provide solutions to let the originating software send queries to the particular location via an internet search portal. In this example the originating software would submit a query and a user s security credentials to the intranet search portal. The intranet search portal would access an authorization and authentication server and obtain appropriate security credentials to access the human resources database search engine. The internet search portal would then submit the search with the appropriate credentials to the human resources database search engine obtain results and return the results to the originating software.

In some implementations a location B may in response to a request from a location A give information about other locations it can access herein called self description. Some implementation may also allow nesting where using the previous example location B may request further request from a location C that location B can access a list of other locations that C can access and return this list of location to location A. This nesting may be repeated for any or all of the locations accessible directly or indirectly i.e. through another location from location A.

The detailed description provided below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of example implementations and is not intended to represent the only forms in federated search may be constructed or utilized. The description sets forth the functions of example implementations and the sequence of steps for constructing and operating the examples. However the same or equivalent functions and sequences may be accomplished by alternate implementations. Like numerals refer to like parts in the accompanying drawings.

Described herein are among other things examples of various technologies and techniques that allow federated search. Although the examples are described and illustrated herein as being implemented in a personal computer system the system described is provided as an example and not a limitation. As those skilled in the art will appreciate the present examples are suitable for application in a variety of different types of systems.

In some implementations of systems containing a query federator module QFM a user interface is provided allowing an original query to be entered. Such a user interface may contain one area to enter an original query one or more areas to display returned results and a way to select which locations should be queried herein known as selected locations out of a set of possible locations. The set of locations may be determined in a number of manners including but not limited to what an end user selects and configures or by what an administrator may configure via an administrative user interface.

The original query is processed and analyzed by the QFM and queries appropriate for each of the selected resources or processed queries are created. A processed query may be an unmodified copy of the original query or it may be modified in syntax or content. For example an original query may contain a clause to find a result where a property called title contains the word cloud. If a selected location has a property semantically equivalent to title but called caption the QFM may change the processed query to reference the property caption instead of title . In another example if an original query was entered using one syntax and a selected location requires a different syntax the QFM may provide a processed query matching the semantics of the original query but using the syntax of the selected location instead of the original query.

A processed query for each selected location is submitted to the respective selected location and results are returned to the QFM. The results are then mapped back so that the metadata in them is consistent with what the original system expects. For example if the results have properties with names of Subject and Filename they might be mapped to Title and URL so that the original system knows how to display these properties. The results are returned to and displayed in the user interface. The user interface may be divided into areas or sections corresponding to the selected location. In an alternate embodiment all of the results may be displayed in one section of the user interface. Any interaction in the returned result portion of the user interface such as a mouse click is passed through to the location that provided that returned result. This allows for example a web search location to receive a click on a web page title and open the corresponding web page or for a payroll application to receive a click on a name and open the corresponding payroll information.

Server computer provides access to server computers and through wide area network . Server computers host locations respectively.

Client computer includes web browser software not shown . Web browser software is accessing QFM . QFM accesses locations to provide search results.

While this example shows client computer as being connected to other locations through server computer in other implementations client computer may be connected to any number of locations directly through a local area network through a wide area network a combination of both local area networks and wide area networks or through any other type of connection that may be available. QFM may also be implemented directly on client computer removing the need for server computer in this example. Those skilled in the art will recognize that there are many other configurations capable of supporting a federated search.

In some implementations processing of queries to prepare them for execution by other locations may happen in a location passing a query to a next location. In other implementations processing of queries may happen in client computer . In yet other implementations one location may process queries for all other locations. Other implementations may centralize or distribute query processing in various ways.

In at least one implementation user credentials will be passed along with a query while in some other implementations user credentials may not be used at all. In some implementations user credentials may be used to obtain other security credentials that may be required for access to some locations. One skilled in the art will recognize that any security requirements may be handled in many different ways in different implementations.

An administrative object manager provides location information to QFM. This location information is used to determine if a location should be searched or called based on triggers module . Triggers module may include criteria such as whether the query language can be matched to what a location requires whether certain keywords or patterns are contained in query whether a location provides high confidence results for the type of data being queried or any other criterion or combination of criteria that is implemented.

Once a location to be called has been determined the query is mapped by map query module to provide a processed query to match the location s requirements. For example if the original query had referred to a field named author and the location had a similar field but it was named name the map query module would provide a processed query referring to name rather than author. In another example if the original query used a different syntax for a query than the location did map query module would provide a processed query with an appropriate syntax for the location. In yet another example map query module may update authentication information to allow access to the location. One skilled in the art will recognize that there are many ways that a query may need to be mapped to match a location s requirements. Once mapped the processed query is submitted to the location. The triggers module and query map module are implemented for each of the selected locations.

In this example location location location and location n each receive processed queries. There may be any number of locations in other implementations. While this implementation shows the triggers module and query map module residing in the QFM the function provided by these modules could be performed outside QFM on other devices or in different orders than those described herein.

While the flowcharts described below show a particular ordering of steps in other implementations steps may be performed in different orders than those shown while in some implementations some steps may be performed simultaneously with other steps.
