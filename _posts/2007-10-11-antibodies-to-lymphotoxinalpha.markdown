This non provisional application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 829 257 filed on 12 Oct. 2006 and of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 938 999 filed on 18 May 2007 which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention concerns antibodies and their uses to treat autoimmune disorders. More particularly the present invention concerns antibodies that bind to lymphotoxin and may also block binding of the lymphotoxin ligand to one or more receptors.

Autoimmune diseases remain clinically important diseases in humans. As the name implies autoimmune diseases wreak their havoc through the body s own immune system. While the pathological mechanisms differ among individual types of autoimmune diseases one general mechanism involves the binding of certain antibodies referred to herein as self reactive antibodies or autoantibodies present. Physicians and scientists have identified more than 70 clinically distinct autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis RA multiple sclerosis MS vasculitis immune mediated diabetes and lupus such as systemic lupus erythematosus SLE . While many autoimmune diseases are rare affecting fewer than 200 000 individuals collectively these diseases afflict millions of Americans an estimated five percent of the population with women disproportionately affected by most diseases. The chronic nature of these diseases leads to an immense social and financial burden.

Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF related proteins are recognized in the art as a large family of proteins having a variety of activities ranging from host defense to immune regulation to apoptosis. TNF was first identified as a serum derived factor that was cytotoxic for several transformed cell lines in vitro and caused necrosis of certain tumors in vivo. A similar factor in the superfamily was identified and referred to as lymphotoxin LT . Due to observed similarities between TNF and LT in the early 1980 s it was proposed that TNF and LT be referred to as TNF and TNF respectively. Scientific literature thus makes reference to both nomenclatures. As used in the present application the term TNF refers to TNF . Later research revealed two forms of lymphotoxin referred to as LT and LT . US 2005 0129614 describes another polypeptide member of the TNF ligand super family based on structural and biological similarities designated TL 5.

Members of the TNF family of proteins exist in membrane bound forms that act locally through cell cell contact or as secreted proteins. A family of TNF related receptors react with these proteins and trigger a variety of signalling pathways including cell death or apoptosis cell proliferation tissue differentiation and proinflammatory responses. TNF by itself has been implicated in inflammatory diseases autoimmune diseases viral bacterial and parasitic infections malignancies and or neurodegenerative diseases and is a useful target for specific biological therapy in diseases such as RA and Crohn s disease.

Cloning of the TNF and LT proteins and further characterization of their respective biological activities reveal that the proteins differ in many aspects. Aggarwal et al. Wiley Liss Inc. 1990 pp. 375 384. For instance LT is a secreted soluble protein of approximately 20 kDa 25 kDa if N and O glycosylated . TNF in contrast has no site for glycosylation and is synthesized with an apparent transmembrane domain that results in the original protein transcript being cell associated. Proteolysis of the cell associated TNF protein results in the release of the soluble form of the protein having a molecular weight of approximately 19 kDa. TNF is produced primarily by activated macrophages whereas LT is produced by activated lymphocytes. Wong et al. Beutler B. ed. Raven Press 1991 pp. 473 484. The sequences encoding TNF and LT also differ. TNF and LT share only approximately 32 amino acid sequence identity. Regarding the different biological activities of TNF and LT TNF increases production of endothelial cell interleukin 1 IL 1 whereas LT has little effect thereon. Further TNF induces production of macrophage colony stimulating factor from macrophages whereas LT has no effect thereon. These and other biological activities are discussed in Aggarwal Aggarwal and Vicek eds. 1992 pp. 61 78.

TNF and LT are described further in the review articles by Spriggs Tumor Necrosis Factor Basic Principles and Preclinical Studies DeVita et al. eds. J.B. Lippincott Company 1991 Ch. 16 pp. 354 377 Ruddle 4 327 332 1992 Wong et al. Tumor Necrosis Factor Academic Press 1989 pp. 195 215 and Paul et al. 6 407 438 1988 .

In non tumor cells TNF and TNF related cytokines are active in a variety of immune responses. Both TNF and LT ligands bind to and activate TNF receptors p55 or p60 and p75 or p80 herein called TNF R .

Cell surface LT complexes have been characterized in CD4 T cell hybridoma cells II 23.D7 which express high levels of LT Browning et al. 147 1230 1237 1991 Androlewicz et al. 267 2542 2547 1992 . The expression and biological roles of LT R LT subunits and surface LT complexes are reviewed in Ware et al. The ligands and receptors of the lymphotoxin system in . Springer Verlag pp. 175 218 1995 .

LT expression is induced and LT secreted primarily by activated T and B lymphocytes and natural killer NK cells. Among the T helper cell subclasses LT appears to be produced by Th1 but not Th2 cells. LT has also been detected in melanocytes. LT also called p33 has been identified on the surface of T lymphocytes T cell lines B cell lines and lymphokine activated killer LAK cells. Studies have shown that LTD is not functional in the absence of LT .

LT exists either as a homotrimer LT 3 or a heterotrimer with LT . These heterotrimers contain either two subunits of LT and one subunit of LT LT 2 1 or one subunit of LT and two of LT LT 1 2 .

The only known cell surface receptors for the LT homotrimer are the two TNF receptors p55 and p75. However the LT heterotrimer LT 1 2 does not bind to the TNF receptors and instead binds to a member of the TNF receptor superfamily lymphotoxin receptor referred to herein as LT R . The heterotrimeric form LT 2 1 likely binds TNF receptors.

LT R has a well described role both in the development of the immune system and in the functional maintenance of a number of cells in the immune system including follicular dendritic cells and a number of stromal cell types Matsumoto et al. 156 137 1997 . Known ligands to the LT R include not only LT 1 2 but also a second ligand called LIGHT Mauri et al. 8 21 1998 . Activation of LT R has been shown to induce the apoptotic death of certain cancer cell lines in vivo U.S. Pat. No. 6 312 691 . Humanized antibodies to LT R and methods of use thereof are provided in US 2004 0058394 and stated as being useful for treating or reducing the advancement severity or effects of neoplasia in humans. Further EP 1585547 WO 2004 058183 LePage and Gill discloses combination therapies that include a composition that activates LT R signaling in combination with one or more other chemotherapeutic agents as well as therapeutic methods and screening methods for identifying agents that in combination with a LT R agonist agent have an additive effect on tumor inhibition.

LT is important for lymphoneogenesis as evident from knockout mice. See Futterer et al. 9 1 59 70 1998 showing that mice deficient in LT R lacked lymph nodes and Peyer s patches and also showing impaired antibody affinity maturation. Rennert et al. 9 1 71 9 1998 reported that an agonist monoclonal antibody against LT R restored the ability to make lymph nodes in LT knockout mice. See also Wu et al. 166 3 1684 9 2001 and Endres et al. 189 1 159 68 1999 Dohi et al. 167 5 2781 90 2001 and Matsumoto et al. 163 3 1584 91 1999 . Korner et al. 27 10 2600 9 1997 reported that mice lacking both TNF and LT showed retarded B cell maturation and serum immunoglobulin deficiencies whereas mice lacking only TNF showed no such deficiencies.

In addition LT is important for inflammation. LT is overexpressed in the pancreas of RIP.LT transgenic mice which have shown inflammation increased chemokine expression and a lymphoid like structure and in which overexpression of LT alone has demonstrated no additional inflammation. Further LT deficient mice exhibit impaired TNF production and defective splenic architecture and function are restored when such mice are crossed to TNF transgene Kollias 188 745 1998 Chaplin 17 399 1999 and decreased TNF levels are restored after pathogenic challenge Eugster 31 1935 2001 .

When TNF or LT interacts with the TNF receptors TNFRI and or TNFRII the result is proinflammatory responses and or apoptosis. When LT 1 2 interacts with the receptor LT R the result is lymphoneogenesis and induction of chemokines and adhesion molecules. Autoimmune diseases are associated with lymphoneogenesis and inflammatory responses and there is increased LT expression in patients with autoimmune disease including MS inflammatory bowel disease IBD and RA Weyand et al. 15 259 266 2003 Selmaj et al. 87 949 954 1991 Matusevicius et al. 66 115 123 1996 Powell et al. 2 6 539 44 1990 Zipp et al. Annals of Neurology 38 5 723 730 1995 Voskuhl et al. 15 2 137 43 1993 Selmaj et al. 147 1522 29 1991 Agyekum et al. 199 1 115 21 2003 and Takemura et al. 167 1072 2001 .

As to MS specifically serum LT correlates with lesions disease burden in MS Kraus et al. Scandinavica 105 4 300 8 2002 . LT is involved in demyelination but not remyelination in an in vivo cuprizone model whereas TNF is required for both Plant et al. 49 1 14 2005 .

As to RA specifically levels of human LT 3 and TNF in RA patients are elevated over those of normal donors Stepien 9 145 1998 . The roles of LT in RA include serum LT is present in some RA patients increased LT protein is present in synovium the LT pathway is associated with ectopic lymphoneogenesis in synovium and there is increased LT R expression on fibroblast like synoviocytes in RA patients. In addition a case report discloses that neutralizing LT 3 is beneficial for an infliximab resistant RA patient Buch et al. 63 1344 46 2004 . Also Han et al. 52 3202 3209 2005 describes that blockading the LT pathway exacerbates autoimmune arthritis by enhancing the Th1 response.

Preclinical efficacy for prevention and treatment with LT R Ig in collagen induced arthritis CIA is shown in Fava et al. 171 1 115 26 2003 . Further LT deficient mice are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE Suen et al. 186 1233 40 1997 Sean Riminton et al. 187 9 1517 28 1998 . There is also published efficacy of LT R Ig in EAE Gommerman et al. 112 5 755 67 2003 . Also LT R Ig disrupts lymphogenesis in mice. Mackay et al. 27 8 2033 42 1997 . Further administration of LT R Ig decreases insulin dependent diabetes mellitus IDDM in non obese diabetic mice Wu et al. 193 11 1327 32 2001 . The role of LT in lymphogenesis in non human primates was investigated by Gommerman et al. 110 9 1359 69 2002 using LT R Ig. Further LT deficient mice are less susceptible to BCG than TNF deficient mice. Eugster et al. 31 1935 2001 .

Antibodies are proteins that exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen. Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150 000 daltons composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain V followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end V and a constant domain at its other end the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are responsible for the binding specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions CDRs both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework regions FRs . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 .

The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy chains antibodies or immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy chain constant regions that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. Of the human immunoglobulin classes only human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgM are known to activate complement and human IgG1 and IgG3 mediate antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC more effectively than IgG2 and IgG4.

Two main approaches have been used to develop therapeutic compounds that inhibit TNF . The first exemplified by infliximab a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF also known as REMICADE infliximab is to neutralize TNF action by using a specific monoclonal antibody of high affinity and potency to prevent binding of TNF to its receptors. The second exemplified by etanercept also known as ENBREL etanercept is to inhibit TNF by using a TNF receptor based molecule that functions as a decoy to reduce the binding of TNF to its natural receptors. Although both types of molecules can prevent the binding of TNF to its receptors receptor based inhibitors such as etanercept will also prevent receptor binding of LT .

The practice of the present invention will employ unless otherwise indicated conventional techniques of molecular biology including recombinant techniques microbiology cell biology biochemistry and immunology which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature such as second edition Sambrook et al. 1989 M. J. Gait ed. 1984 R. I. Freshney ed. 1987 Academic Press Inc. F. M. Ausubel et al. eds. 1987 and periodic updates Mullis et al. ed. 1994 Perbal Bernard V. 1988 Barbas et al. 2001 .

 Lymphotoxin or LT is defined herein as a biologically active polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in FIG. 2A of U.S. Pat. No. 5 824 509. LT is defined to specifically exclude human TNF or its natural animal analogues Pennica et al. 312 20 27 724 729 1984 and Aggarwal et al. 260 2345 2354 1985 . LT is defined to specifically exclude human LT as defined for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 661 004.

 Lymphotoxin 3 trimer or LT 3 refers to a homotrimer of LT monomers. This homotrimer is anchored to the cell surface by the LT transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.

 Lymphotoxin or LT or LT complex refers to a heterotrimer of LT with LT . These heterotrimers contain either two subunits of LT and one subunit of LT LT 2 1 or one subunit of LT and two of LT LT 1 2 .

 Tumor necrosis factor receptor I or TNFRI and tumor necrosis factor receptor II or TNFRII refer to cell surface TNF receptors for the LT homotrimer also known as p55 and p75 respectively.

 Regulatory cytokines are cytokines the abnormal levels of which indicate the presence of an autoimmune disorder in a patient. Such cytokines include for example interleukin 1 IL 1 IL 2 IL 3 IL 4 IL 5 IL 69 IL 7 IL 8 IL 10 IL 12 IL 13 IL 14 IL 15 IL 18 IL 23 IL 24 IL 25 IL 26 BLyS April TGF TGF interferon IFN IFN IFN MIP 1 MIF MCP 1 M CSF or G CSF a lymphotoxin LIGHT 4 1BB ligand CD27 ligand CD30 ligand CD40 ligand Fas ligand GITR ligand OX40 ligand RNAK ligand THANK TRAIL TWEAK and VEG1.

Preferably the regulatory cytokine is an IL such as IL 1b or IL 6 and or a TNF family member.

 Inflammatory cytokines associated with rheumatoid arthritis refer to IL 6 IL 1b and TNF associated with RA pathology which can be inhibited systemically and or in the joints in an in vitro collagen induced arthritis assay.

The expression modulates LT expressing cells refers to depleting or altering proteins made by the cells such as cytokines chemokines or growth factors with the cells including for example monocytes dendritic cells T cells and B cells.

The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies e.g. full length or intact monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multivalent antibodies and multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity and may also include certain antibody fragments as described in greater detail herein . An antibody can be chimeric human humanized and or affinity matured.

 Antibody fragments comprise only a portion of an intact antibody wherein the portion preferably retains at least one more preferably most or all of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment an antibody fragment for example one that comprises the Fc region retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody such as FcRn binding antibody half life modulation ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For example such an antibody fragment may comprise an antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment. In one embodiment an antibody of the invention is a one armed antibody as described in WO 2005 063816 for example an antibody comprising Fc mutations constituting knobs and holes . For example a hole mutation can be one or more of T366A L368A and or Y407V in an Fc polypeptide and a cavity mutation can be T366W. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

For the purposes herein an intact antibody is one comprising heavy and light variable domains as well as an Fc region.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier monoclonal is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies useful in the present invention may be prepared by the hybridoma methodology first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made using recombinant DNA methods in e.g. bacterial non animal eukaryotic animal or plant cells see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 . The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in e.g. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 .

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Methods of making chimeric antibodies are known in the art.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof such as Fv Fab Fab F ab 2 or other antigen binding subsequences of antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a CDR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat or rabbit having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances Fv FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence although the FR regions may include one or more amino acid substitutions that improve binding affinity. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR is typically no more than six in the H chain and no more than three in the L chain. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Reichmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

The humanized antibody includes a PRIMATIZED antibody wherein the antigen binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by e.g. immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest. Methods of making humanized antibodies are known in the art.

A human antibody is one that possesses an amino acid sequence that corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues. Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 1991 . Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al. Alan R. Liss p. 77 1985 Boerner et al. 147 1 86 95 1991 .

An affinity matured antibody is an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alteration s . Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and or framework residues is described by Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al. 226 889 896 1992 .

An antigen is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide carbohydrate nucleic acid lipid hapten or another naturally occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably the target antigen is polypeptide. An acceptor human framework for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or from a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof or may contain pre existing amino acid sequence changes. Where pre existing amino acid changes are present preferably no more than five and more preferably four or less and still more preferably three or less pre existing amino acid changes are present. Where pre existing amino acid changes are present in a VH preferably those changes are only at three two or one of positions 71 73 and 78 for instance the histidine residues at those positions may be alanine residues. In one embodiment the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.

A human consensus framework is a framework that represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residue in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Typically this subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al. supra. In one embodiment for the VL the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al. supra. In one embodiment for the VH the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al supra.

A VH subgroup III consensus framework comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al. supra. In one embodiment the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences 

In another embodiment the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences 

A VL subgroup I consensus framework comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al. supra. In one embodiment the VL subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences 

In another embodiment the VL subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences 

The term complementarity determining region or CDR when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain that are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions three in the VH H1 H2 H3 and three in the VL L1 L2 L3 . A number of CDR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat CDRs are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. supra . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted below.

CDRs may comprise extended CDRs as follows 24 36 or 24 34 L1 46 56 or 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the VL and 26 35 H1 50 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al. supra for each of these definitions. Throughout the present specification and claims the numbering of the residues in an immunoglobulin heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al. supra. The EU index as in Kabat refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.

An unmodified human framework is a human framework that has the same amino acid sequence as the acceptor human framework e.g. lacking human to non human amino acid substitution s in the acceptor human framework.

An altered CDR for the purposes herein is a CDR comprising one or more e.g. one to about 16 amino acid substitution s therein.

An un modified CDR for the purposes herein is a CDR having the same amino acid sequence as a non human antibody from which it was derived i.e. one lacking one or more amino acid substitutions.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the CDR residues as herein defined.

A blocking antibody or an antagonist antibody is one that inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Preferred blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.

An agonist antibody as used herein is an antibody that mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.

An isolated antibody is one that has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably to more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. supra. Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

A parent polypeptide is a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that lacks one or more of the Fc region modifications disclosed herein and that differs in effector function compared to a polypeptide variant as herein disclosed. The parent polypeptide may comprise a native sequence Fc region or an Fc region with pre existing amino acid sequence modifications such as additions deletions and or substitutions .

The term Fc region is used to define a C terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. The Fc region may be a native sequence Fc region or a variant Fc region. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226 or from Pro230 to the carboxyl terminus thereof. The Fc region of an immunoglobulin generally comprises two constant domains CH2 and CH3. The last residue lysine in the heavy chain of IgG1 can but does not have to be present as the terminal residue in the Fc in the mature protein.

The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region also referred to as C 2 domain usually extends from about amino acid 231 to about amino acid 340. The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather two N linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG molecule. It has been speculated that the carbohydrate may provide a substitute for the domain domain pairing and help stabilize the CH2 domain. Burton 22 161 206 1985 .

The CH3 domain comprises the stretch of residues C terminal to a CH2 domain in an Fc region i.e. from about amino acid residue 341 to about amino acid residue 447 of an IgG 

A functional Fc region possesses an effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary effector functions include C1q binding CDC Fc receptor binding ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. LT receptor etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain e.g. an antibody variable domain and can be assessed using various assays as herein disclosed for example.

A native sequence Fc region or wild type Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions are known in the art and include a native sequence human IgG1 Fc region non A and A allotypes native sequence human IgG2 Fc region native sequence human IgG3 Fc region and native sequence human IgG4 Fc region as well as naturally occurring allelic variants thereof.

A variant Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence that differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification as herein defined. Preferably the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80 homology with a native sequence Fc region and or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide more preferably at least about 90 homology therewith and most preferably at least about 95 homology therewith.

The term Fc region containing polypeptide refers to a polypeptide such as an antibody or immunoadhesin see definitions herein which comprises an Fc region.

The terms Fc receptor and FcR are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an IgG antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. In one embodiment the FcR is a Fc R that includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain see review in Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . The term includes allotypes such as Fc RIIIA allotypes Fc RIIIA Phe158 Fc RIIIA Val158 Fc RIIA R131 and or Fc RIIA H131. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 492 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 341 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 2429 2434 1994 .

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies arm the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs and NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS USA 95 652 656 1998 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes that express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes that mediate ADCC include PBMCs NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof e.g. from blood or PBMCs as described herein.

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to antibodies of the appropriate subclass that are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed.

A polypeptide with a variant IgG Fc having altered FcR binding affinity or ADCC activity is one that has either enhanced or diminished FcR binding activity Fc R or FcRn and or ADCC activity compared to a parent polypeptide or to a polypeptide comprising a native sequence Fc region. The variant Fc that exhibits increased binding to an FcR binds at least one FcR with better affinity than the parent polypeptide. The improvement in binding compared to a parent polypeptide may be about three fold preferably about 5 10 25 50 60 100 150 200 and up to 500 fold or about 25 to 1000 improvement in binding. The polypeptide variant that exhibits decreased binding to an FcR binds at least one FcR with less affinity than a parent polypeptide. The decrease in binding compared to a parent polypeptide may be about 40 or more decrease in binding. Such Fc variants that display decreased binding to an FcR may possess little or no appreciable binding to an FcR e.g. about 0 20 binding to the FcR compared to a native sequence IgG Fc region.

The polypeptide having a variant Fc that binds an FcR with better affinity or higher affinity than a polypeptide or parent polypeptide having wild type or native sequence IgG Fc is one that binds any one or more of the above identified FcRs with substantially better binding affinity than the parent polypeptide with native sequence Fc when the amounts of polypeptide with variant Fc and parent polypeptide in the binding assay are essentially the same. For example the variant Fc polypeptide with improved FcR binding affinity may display from about two fold to about 300 fold preferably from about three fold to about 170 fold improvement in FcR binding affinity compared to the parent polypeptide where FcR binding affinity is determined as known in the art.

The polypeptide comprising a variant Fc region that exhibits increased ADCC or mediates ADCC in the presence of human effector cells more effectively than a polypeptide having wild type IgG Fc is one that in vitro or in vivo is substantially more effective at mediating ADCC when the amounts of polypeptide with variant Fc region and the polypeptide with wild type Fc region used in the assay are essentially the same. Generally such variants will be identified using the in vitro ADCC assay as herein disclosed but other assays or methods for determining ADCC activity e.g. in an animal model etc are contemplated. The preferred variant is from about five fold to about 100 fold more preferably from about 25 to about 50 fold more effective at mediating ADCC than the wild type Fc.

An amino acid modification refers to a change in the amino acid sequence of a predetermined amino acid sequence. Exemplary modifications include an amino acid substitution insertion and or deletion. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.

An amino acid modification at a specified position e.g. of the Fc region refers to the substitution or deletion of the specified residue or the insertion of at least one amino acid residue adjacent to the specified residue. By insertion adjacent to a specified residue is meant insertion within one to two residues thereof. The insertion may be N terminal or C terminal to the specified residue.

An amino acid substitution refers to the replacement of at least one existing amino acid residue in a predetermined amino acid sequence with another different replacement amino acid residue. The replacement residue or residues may be naturally occurring amino acid residues i.e. encoded by the genetic code and selected from the group consisting of alanine Ala arginine Arg asparagine Asn aspartic acid Asp cysteine Cys glutamine Gln glutamic acid Glu glycine Gly histidine His isoleucine Ile leucine Leu lysine Lys methionine Met phenylalanine Phe proline Pro serine Ser threonine Thr tryptophan Trp tyrosine Tyr and valine Val . Preferably the replacement residue is not cysteine. Substitution with one or more non naturally occurring amino acid residues is also encompassed by the definition of an amino acid substitution herein. A non naturally occurring amino acid residue refers to a residue other than those naturally occurring amino acid residues listed above which is able to covalently bind adjacent amino acid residues s in a polypeptide chain. Examples of non naturally occurring amino acid residues include norleucine ornithine norvaline homoserine and other amino acid residue analogues such as those described in Eliman et al. 202 301 336 1991 . For generation of such non naturally occurring amino acid residues the procedures of Noren et al. 244 182 1989 and Eliman et al. supra can be used. Briefly these procedures involve chemically activating a suppressor tRNA with a non naturally occurring amino acid residue followed by in vitro transcription and translation of the RNA.

The term conservative amino acid substitution as used within this invention is meant to refer to amino acid substitutions that substitute functionally equivalent amino acids. Conservative amino acid changes result in silent changes in the amino acid sequence of the resulting polypeptide. For example one or more amino acids of a similar polarity act as functional equivalents and result in a silent alteration within the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. In general substitutions within a group may be considered conservative with respect to structure and function. However the skilled artisan will recognize that the role of a particular residue is determined by its context within the three dimensional structure of the molecule in which it occurs. For example Cys residues may occur in the oxidized disulfide form which is less polar than the reduced thiol form. The long aliphatic portion of the Arg side chain may constitute a critical feature of its structural or functional role and this may be best conserved by substitution of a nonpolar rather than another basic residue. Also it will be recognized that side chains containing aromatic groups Trp Tyr and Phe can participate in ionic aromatic or cation pi interactions. In these cases substitution of one of these side chains with a member of the acidic or uncharged polar group may be conservative with respect to structure and function. Residues such as Pro Gly and Cys disulfide form can have direct effects on the main chain conformation and often may not be substituted without structural distortions.

An amino acid insertion refers to the incorporation of at least one amino acid into a predetermined amino acid sequence. While the insertion will usually consist of the insertion of one or two amino acid residues the present application contemplates larger peptide insertions e.g. insertion of about three to about five or even up to about ten amino acid residues. The inserted residue s may be naturally occurring or non naturally occurring as disclosed above.

An amino acid deletion refers to the removal of at least one amino acid residue from a predetermined amino acid sequence.

Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

The hinge region is generally defined as stretching from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 Burton 22 161 206 1985 . Hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues forming inter heavy chain S S bonds in the same positions.

The lower hinge region of an Fc region is normally defined as the stretch of residues immediately C terminal to the hinge region i.e. residues 233 to 239 of the Fc region.

 C1q is a polypeptide that includes a binding site for the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. C1q together with two serine proteases C1r and C1s forms the complex C1 the first component of the CDC pathway. Human C1q can be purchased commercially from e.g. Quidel San Diego Calif.

The term binding domain refers to the region of a polypeptide that binds to another molecule. In the case of an FcR the binding domain can comprise a portion of a polypeptide chain thereof e.g. the chain thereof that is responsible for binding an Fc region. One useful binding domain is the extracellular domain of an FcR chain.

 Functional fragments of the antibodies of the invention comprise a portion of an intact antibody generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody or the Fc region of an antibody that retains FcR binding capability. Examples of antibody fragments include linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

As used herein the term immunoadhesin designates antibody like molecules that combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein an adhesin with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity that is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody i.e. is heterologous and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the immunoadhesin can be obtained from any immunoglobulin such as IgG 1 IgG 2 IgG 3 or IgG 4 subtypes IgA including IgA 1 and IgA 2 IgE IgD or IgM. For example useful immunoadhesins as second medicaments herein include polypeptides that comprise the B lymphocyte stimulator BLyS binding portions of a BLyS receptor without the transmembrane or cytoplasmic sequences of the BLyS receptor. In one embodiment the extracellular domain of BR3 BLyS receptor 3 TACI transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor or BCMA B cell maturation antigen is fused to a constant domain of an immunoglobulin sequence.

A fusion protein and a fusion polypeptide refer to a polypeptide having two portions covalently linked together where each of the portions is a polypeptide having a different property. The property may be a biological property such as activity in vitro or in vivo. The property may also be a simple chemical or physical property such as binding to a target molecule catalysis of a reaction etc. The two portions may be linked directly by a single peptide bond or through a peptide linker containing one or more amino acid residues. Generally the two portions and the linker will be in reading frame with each other.

 Binding affinity generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity that reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant Kd . Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily whereas high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.

An on rate or rate of association or association rate or k according to this invention can be determined with the surface plasmon resonance technique using a BIACORE 2000 or a BIACORE 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. optical biosensor at 25 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 ug ml 0.2 M before injection at a flow rate of 5 l minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of 1M ethanolamine to block unreacted groups for kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in phosphate buffered saline PBS with 0.05 TWEEN 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 l min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIACORE Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd was calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen et al. 293 865 881 1999 . However if the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophotometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM AMINCO spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stirred cuvette.

The Kd or Kd value according to this invention is in one embodiment measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of the antibody and antigen molecule as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate Chen et al. 293 865 881 1999 . To establish conditions for the assay microtiter plates Dynex are coated overnight with 5 g ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbent plate Nunc 269620 100 pM or 26 pM I antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest consistent with assessment of an anti VEGF antibody Fab 12 in Presta et al. 57 4593 4599 1997 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature for one hour. The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 TWEEN 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 l well of scintillant MicroScint 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.

The phrase substantially similar or substantially the same as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference comparator antibody such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kd values . The difference between said two values is preferably less than about 50 more preferably less than about 40 still more preferably less than about 30 even more preferably less than about 20 and most preferably less than about 10 as a function of the value for the reference comparator antibody.

The phrase substantially reduced or substantially different as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference comparator antibody such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kd values HAMA response . The difference between said two values is preferably greater than about 10 more preferably greater than about 20 still more preferably greater than about 30 even more preferably greater than about 40 and most preferably greater than about 50 as a function of the value for the reference comparator antibody.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity and homology with respect to a peptide or polypeptide sequence are defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or MEGALIGN DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein however amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2 authored by Genentech Inc. The source code of ALIGN 2 has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN 2 program is publicly available through Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. The ALIGN 2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN 2 program and do not vary.

In situations where ALIGN 2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons the amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to with or against a given amino acid sequence B which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain amino acid sequence identity to with or against a given amino acid sequence B is calculated as follows 100 times the fraction X Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN 2 in that program s alignment of A and B and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B the amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise all amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described herein using the ALIGN 2 computer program.

A disorder is any condition that would benefit from treatment with an antibody or method of the invention regardless of mechanism but including inhibiting or blocking the action of LT 3 or LT and or by depleting LT positive cells. This condition includes but is not limited to a medical condition or illness mediated by or related to elevated expression or activity or abnormal activation of LT 3 and or LT by any cell. This includes chronic and acute disorders such as those pathological conditions that predispose the mammal to the disorder in question.

An autoimmune disorder herein is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an individual s own tissues or organs or a co segregate or manifestation thereof or resulting condition therefrom. In many of these autoimmune and inflammatory disorders a number of clinical and laboratory markers may exist including but not limited to hypergammaglobulinemia high levels of autoantibodies antigen antibody complex deposits in tissues benefit from corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatments and lymphoid cell aggregates in affected tissues. Without being limited to any one theory regarding B cell mediated autoimmune disorder it is believed that B cells demonstrate a pathogenic effect in human autoimmune diseases through a multitude of mechanistic pathways including autoantibody production immune complex formation dendritic and T cell activation cytokine synthesis direct chemokine release and providing a nidus for ectopic neo lymphogenesis. Each of these pathways may participate to different degrees in the pathology of autoimmune diseases.

As used herein an autoimmune disorder can be an organ specific disease i.e. the immune response is specifically directed against an organ system such as the endocrine system the hematopoietic system the skin the cardiopulmonary system the gastrointestinal and liver systems the renal system the thyroid the ears the neuromuscular system the central nervous system etc. or a systemic disease that can affect multiple organ systems for example systemic lupus erythematosus SLE rheumatoid arthritis polymyositis etc. . Preferred such diseases include autoimmune rheumatologic disorders such as for example rheumatoid arthritis Sj gren s syndrome scleroderma lupus such as SLE and lupus nephritis polymyositis dermatomyositis cryoglobulinemia anti phospholipid antibody syndrome and psoriatic arthritis autoimmune gastrointestinal and liver disorders such as for example inflammatory bowel diseases e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia autoimmune hepatitis primary biliary cirrhosis primary sclerosing cholangitis and celiac disease vasculitis such as for example ANCA negative vasculitis and ANCA associated vasculitis including Churg Strauss vasculitis Wegener s granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis autoimmune neurological disorders such as for example multiple sclerosis MS opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome myasthenia gravis neuromyelitis optica Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease and autoimmune polyneuropathies renal disorders such as for example glomerulonephritis Goodpasture s syndrome and Berger s disease autoimmune dermatologic disorders such as for example psoriasis urticaria hives pemphigus vulgaris bullous pemphigoid and cutaneous lupus erythematosus hematologic disorders such as for example thrombocytopenic purpura thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura post transfusion purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia atherosclerosis uveitis autoimmune hearing diseases such as for example inner ear disease and hearing loss Behcet s disease Raynaud s syndrome organ transplant and autoimmune endocrine disorders such as for example diabetic related autoimmune diseases such as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus IDDM Addison s disease and autoimmune thyroid disease e.g. Graves disease and thyroiditis . More preferred such diseases include for example RA IBD including Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis ANCA associated vasculitis lupus MS Sj gren s syndrome Graves disease IDDM pernicious anemia thyroiditis and glomerulonephritis. Still more preferred are RA IBD lupus and MS and more preferred RA and IBD and most preferred RA.

As used herein rheumatoid arthritis or RA refers to a recognized disease state that may be diagnosed according to the 2000 revised American Rheumatoid Association criteria for the classification of RA or any similar criteria and includes active early and incipient RA as defined below. Physiological indicators of RA include symmetric joint swelling which is characteristic though not invariable in rheumatoid arthritis. Fusiform swelling of the proximal interphalangeal PIP joints of the hands as well as metacarpophalangeal MCP wrists elbows knees ankles and metatarsophalangeal MTP joints are commonly affected and swelling is easily detected. Pain on passive motion is the most sensitive test for joint inflammation and inflammation and structural deformity often limit the range of motion for the affected joint. Typical visible changes include ulnar deviation of the fingers at the MCP joints hyperextension or hyperflexion of the MCP and PIP joints flexion contractures of the elbows and subluxation of the carpal bones and toes. The subject with RA may be resistant to DMARDs in that the DMARDs are not effective or fully effective in treating symptoms. Further candidates for therapy according to this invention include those who have experienced an inadequate response to previous or current treatment with TNF inhibitors such as etanercept infliximab and or adalimumab because of toxicity or inadequate efficacy for example etanercept for 3 months at 25 mg twice a week or at least 4 infusions of infliximab at 3 mg kg .

A patient with active rheumatoid arthritis means a patient with active and not latent symptoms of RA. Subjects with early active rheumatoid arthritis are those subjects with active RA diagnosed for at least eight weeks but no longer than four years according to the revised 1987 ACR criteria for the classification of RA. Subjects with early rheumatoid arthritis are those subjects with RA diagnosed for at least eight weeks but no longer than four years according to the revised 1987 ACR criteria for classification of RA. Early RA includes for example juvenile onset RA juvenile idiopathic arthritis JIA or juvenile RA JRA .

Patients with incipient RA have early polyarthritis that does not fully meet ACR criteria for a diagnosis of RA but is associated with the presence of RA specific prognostic biomarkers such as anti CCP and shared epitope. They include patients with positive anti CCP antibodies who present with polyarthritis but do not yet have a diagnosis of RA and are at high risk for going on to develop bona fide ACR criteria RA 95 probability .

 Joint damage is used in the broadest sense and refers to damage or partial or complete destruction to any part of one or more joints including the connective tissue and cartilage where damage includes structural and or functional damage of any cause and may or may not cause joint pain arthalgia. It includes without limitation joint damage associated with or resulting from inflammatory joint disease as well as non inflammatory joint disease. This damage may be caused by any condition such as an autoimmune disease especially arthritis and most especially RA. Exemplary such conditions include acute and chronic arthritis RA including juvenile onset RA juvenile idiopathic arthritis JIA or juvenile RA JRA and stages such as rheumatoid synovitis gout or gouty arthritis acute immunological arthritis chronic inflammatory arthritis degenerative arthritis type II collagen induced arthritis infectious arthritis septic arthritis Lyme arthritis proliferative arthritis psoriatic arthritis Still s disease vertebral arthritis osteoarthritis arthritis chronica progrediente arthritis deformans polyarthritis chronica primaria reactive arthritis menopausal arthritis estrogen depletion arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis rheumatoid spondylitis rheumatic autoimmune disease other than RA and significant systemic involvement secondary to RA including but not limited to vasculitis pulmonary fibrosis or Felty s syndrome . For purposes herein joints are points of contact between elements of a skeleton of a vertebrate such as an animal with the parts that surround and support it and include but are not limited to for example hips joints between the vertebrae of the spine joints between the spine and pelvis sacroiliac joints joints where the tendons and ligaments attach to bones joints between the ribs and spine shoulders knees feet elbows hands fingers ankles and toes but especially joints in the hands and feet.

As used herein treatment refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease alleviation of symptoms diminishing of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease prevention of metastasis decreasing of the rate of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments the antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder. A subject is successfully treated for example for an autoimmune disorder if after receiving a therapeutic amount of an antibody of the invention according to the methods of the present invention the subject shows observable and or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more signs and symptoms of the particular disease.

In one preferred embodiment of successful treatment the antibody induces a major clinical response in a subject with RA. For purposes herein a major clinical response is defined as achieving an American College of Rheumatology 70 response ACR 70 for six consecutive months. ACR response scores are categorized as ACR 20 ACR 50 and ACR 70 with ACR 70 being the highest level of sign and symptom control in this evaluation system. ACR response scores measure improvement in RA disease activity including joint swelling and tenderness pain level of disability and overall patient and physician assessment. An example of a different type of antibody that induces a major clinical response as recognized by the FDA and as defined herein is etanercept ENBREL .

An effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.

A therapeutically effective amount of a medicament herein may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the individual and the ability of the medicament e.g. antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the drug in question e.g. antibody are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily since a prophylactic Dose is Used in Subjects Prior to or at an Earlier Stage of Disease the Prophylactically Effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.

The antibodies of this invention preferably bind to LT 3 and block the interaction of LT 3 with TNFRI and TNFRII. Preferably they also bind to LT complex and especially on the cell surface. Preferably they also block LT function and or preferably contain an Fc region and or decrease levels of inflammatory cytokines associated with RA in an in vitro collagen induced arthritis assay or an in vitro antibody induced arthritis assay.

In other preferred embodiments the anti LT antibody herein substantially neutralizes at least one activity of at least one LT protein. Preferably the antibody herein targets any cell expressing LT and preferably depletes LT positive or secreting cells.

Preferred antibodies herein bind LT with an affinity of at least about 10M more preferably at least about 10M. The antibodies also preferably are of the IgG isotype such as IgG1 IgG2a IgG2b or IgG3 more preferably human IgG and most preferably IgG1 or IgG2a.

Another preferred antibody has a monovalent affinity to human LT that is about the same as or greater than the monovalent affinity to human LT of a murine antibody produced by a hybridoma cell line deposited under American Type Culture Collection Accession Number PTA 7538 hybridoma murine Lymphotoxin alpha2 beta1 s5H3.2.2 .

As is well established in the art binding affinity of a ligand to its receptor can be determined using any of a variety of assays and expressed in terms of a variety of quantitative values. Accordingly in one embodiment the binding affinity is expressed as Kd values and reflects intrinsic binding affinity e.g. with minimized avidity effects . Generally and preferably binding affinity is measured in vitro whether in a cell free or cell associated setting. Fold difference in binding affinity can be quantified in terms of the ratio of the monovalent binding affinity value of a humanized antibody e.g. in Fab form and the monovalent binding affinity value of a reference comparator antibody e.g. in Fab form e.g. a murine antibody having donor CDR sequences wherein the binding affinity values are determined under similar assay conditions.

Thus in one embodiment the fold difference in binding affinity is determined as the ratio of the Kd values of the humanized antibody in Fab form and said reference comparator Fab antibody. For example in one embodiment if an antibody of the invention A has an affinity that is three fold lower than the affinity of a reference antibody M then if the Kd value for A is 3 the Kd value of M would be 1 and the ratio of Kd of A to Kd of M would be 3 1. Conversely in one embodiment if an antibody of the invention C has an affinity that is three fold greater than the affinity of a reference antibody R then if the Kd value for C is 1 the Kd value of R would be 3 and the ratio of Kd of C to Kd of R would be 1 3. Any assays known in the art including those described herein can be used to obtain binding affinity measurements including for example an optical biosensor that uses SPR BIACORE technology RIA and ELISA. Preferably the measurement is by optical biosensor or radioimmunoassay.

The antibodies herein are preferably chimeric or humanized more preferably humanized and still more preferably antibodies wherein at least a portion of their framework sequence is a human consensus framework sequence.

Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized as described above to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium which medium preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells also referred to as fusion partner . For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 and derivatives e.g. X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 and Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as RIA or ELISA.

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity are identified the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding Monoclonal pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as for example affinity chromatography e.g. using protein A or protein G SEPHAROSE medium or ion exchange chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis etc.

DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al. 5 256 262 1993 and Pl ckthun 130 151 188 1992 .

In a further embodiment monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 . Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies respectively using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity nM range human antibodies by chain shuffling Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.

The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or fusion antibody polypeptides for example by substituting human heavy chain and light chain constant domain Cand C sequences for the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 1984 or by fusing the immunoglobulin coding sequence with all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide heterologous polypeptide . The non immunoglobulin polypeptide sequences can substitute for the constant domains of an antibody or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen combining site having specificity for a different antigen.

The present invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non human antibodies are known in the art. For example a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence that is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 151 2296 1993 Chothia et al. 196 901 1987 . Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. 151 2623 1993 .

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to one method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available that illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

The humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment such as a Fab which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent s in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively the humanized antibody may be a full length antibody such as a full length IgG1 antibody.

As an alternative to humanization human antibodies can be generated. For example it is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region J gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 591 669 all of GenPharm and 5 545 807 and WO 1997 17852.

Alternatively phage display technology McCafferty et al. 348 552 553 1990 can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single stranded DNA copy of the phage genome selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus the phage mimics some of the properties of the LT cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats reviewed in e.g Johnson and Chiswell 3 564 571 1993 . Several sources of V gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 isolated a diverse array of anti oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens including self antigens can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or Griffith et al. 12 725 734 1993 . See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 565 332 and 5 573 905.

As discussed above human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 567 610 and 5 229 275 .

In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See e.g. WO 1993 16185 U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 894 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 587 458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the LT protein. Other such antibodies may combine a LT binding site with a binding site for another protein. Alternatively an anti LT arm may be combined with an arm that binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R such as Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD16 or NKG2D or other NK cell activating ligand so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the LT expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells that express LT . These antibodies possess a LT binding arm and an arm that binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

WO 1996 16673 describes a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5 837 234 discloses a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RI antibody. A bispecific anti ErbB2 Fc antibody is shown in WO 1998 02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 teaches a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti CD3 antibody.

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Millstein et al. 305 537 539 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 1993 08829 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge C2 and C3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region C1 containing the site necessary for light chain bonding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant effect on the yield of the desired chain combination.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 1994 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

In another approach U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168 the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers that are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 1991 00360 WO 1992 20373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describes a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describes the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.

Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Holliger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a Vconnected to a Vby a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the Vand Vdomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary Vand Vdomains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fc region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises or consists of three to about eight but preferably four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain and preferably two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 VD2 X2 Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two and preferably four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated herein comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the recombinant monoclonal antibodies immunoadhesins and other polypeptide antagonists described herein are prokaryote yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms for example Enterobacteriaceae such as e.g. e.g. e.g. and as well as Bacilli such as and e.g. 41P disclosed in DD 266 710 published 12 Apr. 1989 such as and . One preferred cloning host is 294 ATCC 31 446 although other strains such as B X1776 ATCC 31 537 and W3110 ATCC 27 325 are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.

Full length antibody antibody fragments and antibody fusion proteins can be produced in bacteria in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector functions are not needed such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a toxin and the immunoconjugate by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full length antibodies have greater half life in circulation. Production in is faster and more cost efficient. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 648 237 5 789 199 and 5 840 523 which describe translation initiation region TIR and signal sequences for optimizing expression and secretion. After expression the antibody is isolated from the cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be purified through e.g. a protein A or G column depending on the isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody expressed e.g in CHO cells. For general monoclonal antibody production see also U.S. Pat. No. 7 011 974.

In addition to prokaryotes eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody encoding such as LT antibody encoding vectors. or common baker s yeast is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However a number of other genera species and strains are commonly available and useful herein such as hosts such as e.g. ATCC 12 424 ATCC 16 045 ATCC 24 178 ATCC 56 500 ATCC 36 906 and EP 402 226 EP 183 070 EP 244 234 such as and filamentous fungi such as e.g. and hosts such as and

Suitable host cells for the expression of e.g. glycosylated LT binding antibody are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as caterpillar mosquito mosquito fruitfly and have been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available e.g. the L 1 variant of NPV and the Bm 5 strain of NPV and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention particularly for transfection of cells.

Plant cell cultures of cotton corn potato soybean petunia tomato and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.

However interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line e.g. 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK e.g. ATCC CCL 10 Chinese hamster ovary cells DHFR CHO Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 including but not limited to CHO K1 CHO pro3 CHO DG44 CHO DUXB11 Lec13 B Ly1 and CHO DP12 cells preferably a CHO DUX DHFR or subclone thereof herein called CHO DUX C127 cells mouse L cells Ltk cells mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 ATCC CCL 70 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 ATCC CRL 1587 human cervical carcinoma cells HeLa ATCC CCL 2 canine kidney cells MDCK ATCC CCL 34 buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A ATCC CRL 1442 human lung cells W138 ATCC CCL 75 human liver cells Hep G2 HB 8065 mouse myeloma cells NS0 hybridoma cells such as mouse hybridoma cells COS cells mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 ATCC CCL51 TR1 cells Mather et al. 383 44 68 1982 MRC 5 cells FS4 cells and a human hepatoma line Hep G2 .

Host cells are transformed with expression or cloning vectors for production of the LT binding antibody herein and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 1990 03430 WO 1987 00195 or US Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

In one particular aspect a suitable medium contains a basal medium component such as a DMEM HAM F 12 based formulation for composition of DMEM and HAM F12 media and especially serum free media see culture media formulations in the Sixth Edition 1988 pages 346 349 the formulations of medium as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 469 may be appropriate with suitably modified if necessary concentrations of some components such as amino acids salts sugar and vitamins and optionally containing glycine hypoxanthine and thymidine recombinant human insulin hydrolyzed peptone such as PROTEASE PEPTONE 2 and 3 PRIMATONE HS or PRIMATONE RL Difco USA Sheffield England or the equivalent a cell protective agent such as PLURONIC F68 or the equivalent PLURONIC polyol GENTAMYCIN antibiotic and trace elements. Preferably the cell culture media is serum free.

In one aspect of the invention antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large scale fed batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large scale fermentations have at least about 1000 liters of capacity preferably about 1 000 to 100 000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients especially glucose the preferred carbon energy source . Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity and can range from about one liter to about 100 liters.

In a fermentation process induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density e.g. an ODof about 180 220 at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12 50 hours although longer or shorter induction time may be used.

To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins such as Dsb proteins DsbA DsbB DsbC DsbD and or DsbG or FkpA a peptidylprolyl cis trans isomerase with chaperone activity can be used to co transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. 274 19601 19605 1999 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 083 715 and 6 027 888 Bothmann and Pluckthun 275 17100 17105 2000 Ramm and Pluckthun 275 17106 17113 2000 and Arie et al. 39 199 210 2001 .

To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins especially those that are proteolytically sensitive certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation s in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III OmpT DegP Tsp Protease I Protease Mi Protease V Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some protease deficient strains are available and described in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 264 365 5 508 192 and Hara et al. 2 63 72 1996 .

In one embodiment strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system herein.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an AMICON or MILLIPORE PELLICON ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

In one embodiment the antibody protein produced herein is further purified to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures hydroxylapatite chromatography chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE gel electrophoresis dialysis fractionation on immunoaffinity columns ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as DEAE or a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration using for example SEPHADEX G 75 resin. Affinity chromatography is a preferred purification technique. For analytical scale purification smaller volumes are passed through columns and used for preparative or commercial scale purification to produce quantities of antibody useful in therapeutic applications larger volumes are employed. The skilled artisan will understand which scale should be used for which application. Preferably preparative scale is employed for this invention.

The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain the BAKERBOND ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification.

For Protein A chromatography the solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized is preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface more preferably a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications the column has been coated with a reagent such as glycerol to prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants. The solid phase is then washed to remove contaminants non specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 to 0.25M salt .

Reduction or elimination of a HAMA response is a significant aspect of clinical development of suitable therapeutic agents. See e.g. Khaxzaeli et al. 80 937 1988 Jaffers et al. 41 572 1986 Shawler et al. 135 1530 1985 Sears et al. 3 138 1984 Miller et al. 62 988 1983 Hakimi et al. 147 1352 1991 Reichmann et al. 332 323 1988 and Junghans et al. 50 1495 1990 . In some embodiments herein the invention provides antibodies that are humanized such that HAMA response is reduced or eliminated. Variants of these antibodies can further be obtained using routine methods known in the art some of which are further described below.

For example an amino acid sequence from an antibody as described herein can serve as a starting parent sequence for diversification of the framework and or CDR sequence s . A selected framework sequence to which a starting CDR sequence is linked is referred to herein as an acceptor human framework. While the acceptor human frameworks may be from or derived from a human immunoglobulin the VL and or VH regions thereof preferably the acceptor human frameworks are from or derived from a human consensus framework sequence as such frameworks have been demonstrated to have minimal or no immunogenicity in human patients.

Where the acceptor is derived from a human immunoglobulin one may optionally select a human framework sequence based on its homology to the donor framework sequence by aligning the donor framework sequence with various human framework sequences in a collection of human framework sequences and selecting the most homologous framework sequence as the acceptor.

In one embodiment human consensus frameworks herein are from or derived from VH subgroup III and or VL kappa subgroup I consensus framework sequences.

Thus the VH acceptor human framework may comprise one two three or all of the following framework sequences 

The VL acceptor human framework may comprise one two three or all of the following framework sequences 

While the acceptor may be identical in sequence to the human framework sequence selected whether that be from a human immunoglobulin or a human consensus framework the present invention contemplates that the acceptor sequence may comprise pre existing amino acid substitutions relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or human consensus framework sequence. These pre existing substitutions are preferably minimal usually only four three two or one amino acid difference relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or consensus framework sequence.

CDR residues of the non human antibody are incorporated into the VL and or VH acceptor human frameworks. For example one may incorporate residues corresponding to the Kabat CDR residues the Chothia hypervariable loop residues the AbM residues and or the contact residues. Optionally the extended CDR residues as follows are incorporated 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 26 35 H1 50 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 .

 Incorporation of CDR residues can be achieved in various ways e.g. nucleic acid encoding the desired amino acid sequence can be generated by mutating nucleic acid encoding the mouse variable domain sequence so that the framework residues thereof are changed to acceptor human framework residues or by mutating nucleic acid encoding the human variable domain sequence so that the CDR residues are changed to non human residues or by synthesizing nucleic acid encoding the desired sequence etc.

CDR grafted variants may be generated by Kunkel mutagenesis of nucleic acid encoding the human acceptor sequences using a separate oligonucleotide for each CDR. Kunkel et al. 154 367 382 1987 . Appropriate changes can be introduced within the framework and or CDR using routine techniques to correct and re establish proper CDR antigen interactions.

Phage mid display also referred to herein as phage display in some contexts can be used as a convenient and fast method for generating and screening many different potential variant antibodies in a library generated by sequence randomization. However other methods for making and screening altered antibodies are available to the skilled person.

Phage mid display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting novel proteins that bind to a ligand such as an antigen. Using the techniques of phage mid display allows the generation of large libraries of protein variants that can be rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are generally fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phagemid display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been developed. Bass 8 309 1990 Lowman and Wells 3 205 1991 . In a monovalent phagemid display system the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 723 286 5 432 018 5 580 717 5 427 908 and 5 498 530 .

Libraries of antibodies have been prepared in a number of ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or cloning a family of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage mid display are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 750 373 5 733 743 5 837 242 5 969 108 6 172 197 5 580 717 and 5 658 727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or antigen binding proteins with the desired characteristics.

The sequence of oligonucleotides includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the CDR residues to be altered. A codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. Codon sets can be represented using symbols to designate particular nucleotides or equimolar mixtures of nucleotides as shown below according to the IUB code.

For example in the codon set DVK D can be nucleotides A or G or T V can be A or G or C and K can be G or T. This codon set can present 18 different codons and can encode amino acids Ala Trp Tyr Lys Thr Asn Lys Ser Arg Asp Glu Gly and Cys.

Oligonucleotide or primer sets can be synthesized using standard methods. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized for example by solid phase synthesis containing sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide degeneracy at certain positions is well known in that art. Such sets of nucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers available from for example Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. or can be obtained commercially for example from Life Technologies Rockville Md. . Therefore a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides as used herein have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can include restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes.

In one method nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids can be created by oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis. This technique is well known in the art as described by Zoller et al. 10 6487 6504 1987 . Briefly nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids are created by hybridizing an oligonucleotide set encoding the desired codon sets to a DNA template where the template is the single stranded form of the plasmid containing a variable region nucleic acid template sequence. After hybridization DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the oligonucleotide primer and will contain the codon sets as provided by the oligonucleotide set.

Generally oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used. An optimal oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on either side of the nucleotide s coding for the mutation s . This ensures that the oligonucleotide will hybridize properly to the single stranded DNA template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using techniques known in the art such as that in Crea et al. 75 5765 1978 .

The DNA template is generated by those vectors that are derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors the commercially available M13mp18 and M13mp19 vectors are suitable or that contain a single stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153 3 1987 . Thus the DNA to be mutated can be inserted into one of these vectors to generate single stranded template. Production of the single stranded template is described in sections 4.21 4.41 of Sambrook et al. supra.

To alter the native DNA sequence the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the single stranded template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA polymerizing enzyme for example T7 DNA polymerase or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I is then added to synthesize the complementary strand of the template using the oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis. A heteroduplex molecule is thus formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of gene 1 and the other strand the original template encodes the native unaltered sequence of gene 1. This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell usually a prokaryote such as JM101. After growing the cells they are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the oligonucleotide primer radiolabeled with a P phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that contain the mutated DNA.

The method described immediately above may be modified such that a homoduplex molecule is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the mutation s . The modifications are as follows The single stranded oligonucleotide is annealed to the single stranded template as described above. A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides deoxyriboadenosine dATP deoxyriboguanosine dGTP and deoxyribothymidine dTT is combined with a modified thiodeoxyribocytosine called dCTP aS which can be obtained from Amersham . This mixture is added to the template oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this mixture a strand of DNA identical to the template except for the mutated bases is generated. In addition this new strand of DNA will contain dCTP aS instead of dCTP which serves to protect it from restriction endonuclease digestion. After the template strand of the double stranded heteroduplex is nicked with an appropriate restriction enzyme the template strand can be digested with ExoIII nuclease or another appropriate nuclease past the region that contains the site s to be mutagenized. The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that is only partially single stranded. A complete double stranded DNA homoduplex is then formed using DNA polymerase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates ATP and DNA ligase. This homoduplex molecule can then be transformed into a suitable host cell.

As indicated previously the sequence of the oligonucleotide set is of sufficient length to hybridize to the template nucleic acid and may also but does not necessarily contain restriction sites. The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors or vectors that contain a single stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153 3 1987 . Thus the DNA that is to be mutated must be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single stranded template. Production of the single stranded template is described in sections 4.21 4.41 of Sambrook et al. supra.

In another method a library can be generated by providing upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets each set having a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences. These sequences are established by the codon sets provided within the sequence of the oligonucleotides. The upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets along with a variable domain template nucleic acid sequence can be used in a polymerase chain reaction PCR to generate a library of PCR products. The PCR products can be referred to as nucleic acid cassettes as they can be fused with other related or unrelated nucleic acid sequences for example viral coat proteins and dimerization domains using established molecular biology techniques.

The sequence of the PCR primers includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the solvent accessible and highly diverse positions in a CDR. As described above a codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids.

Antibody selectants that meet the desired criteria as selected through appropriate screening selection steps can be isolated and cloned using standard recombinant techniques.

The antibodies of the present invention can be characterized for their physical chemical properties and biological functions by various assays known in the art.

The purified immunoglobulins can be further characterized by a series of assays including but not limited to N terminal sequencing amino acid analysis non denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC mass spectrometry ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.

In certain embodiments of the invention the antibodies produced herein are analyzed for their biological activity. In some embodiments the antibodies herein are tested for their antigen binding activity. The antigen binding assays known in the art and useful herein include without limitation any direct or competitive binding assays using techniques such as Western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays fluorescent immunoassays and protein A immunoassays.

In one embodiment the present invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses some but not all effector functions which make it a desired candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fc activities of the produced immunoglobulin are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337. Useful effector cells for such assays include PBMCs and NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art.

In some embodiments amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced into the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that the sequence is made.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid most preferably alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide that increases the serum half life of the antibody.

Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the CDRs but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table A under the heading of preferred substitutions. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in Table A or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes may be introduced and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains as described for example in A. L. Lehninger 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or more preferably into the remaining non conserved sites.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more CDR residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several CDR sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed. For location of candidate CDR sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify CDR residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

The antibodies of the present invention preferably have the native sequence Fc region. However it may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications into an Fc region thereof generating a Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. Such amino acid substitutions may e.g. improve or reduce other Fc function or further improve the same Fc function increase antigen binding affinity increase stability alter glycosylation or include allotypic variants. The antibodies may further comprise one or more amino acid substitutions in the Fc region that result in the antibody exhibiting one or more of the properties selected from increased Fc R binding increased ADCC increased CDC decreased CDC increased ADCC and CDC function increased ADCC but decreased CDC function e.g. to minimize infusion reaction increased FcRn binding and increased serum half life as compared to the same antibodies that have the wild type Fc region. These activities can be measured by the methods described herein. For example see WO 1999 51642. See also Duncan and Winter 322 738 40 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 260 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 and WO 1994 29351 concerning other examples of Fcregion variants.

For additional amino acid alterations that improve Fc function see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056. Any of the antibodies of the present invention may further comprise at least one amino acid substitution in the Fc region that decreases CDC activity for example comprising at least the substitution K322A. See U.S. Pat. No. 6 528 624 Idusogie et al. .

In another preferred embodiment the antibody has amino acid substitutions at any one or any combination of positions that are 268D or 298A or 326D or 333A or 334A or 298A together with 333A or 298A together with 334A or 239D together with 332E or 239D together with 298A and 332E or 239D together with 268D and 298A and 332E or 239D together with 268D and 298A and 326A and 332A or 239D together with 268D and 298A and 326A and 332E or 239D together with 268D and 283L and 298A and 332E or 239D together with 268D and 283L and 298A and 326A and 332E or 239D together with 330L and 332E and 272Y and 254T and 256E or 250Q together with 428L or 265A or 297A wherein the 265A substitution is in the absence of 297A and the 297A substitution is in the absence of 265A. The letter after the number in each of these designations represents the changed amino acid at that position.

Mutations that improve ADCC and CDC include substitutions at one to three positions of the Fc region including positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region Eu numbering of residues especially S298A together with E333A and K334A S298A E333A K334A or synonymously a combination of 298A 333A and 334A also referred to herein as the triple Ala mutant. K334L increases binding to CD16. K322A results in reduced CDC activity K326A or K326W enhances CDC activity. D265A results in reduced ADCC activity.

Stability variants are variants that show improved stability with respect to e.g. oxidation and deamidation.

A further type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. Such altering includes deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody and or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody. Glycosylation variants that increase ADCC function are described e.g. in WO 2003 035835. See also US 2006 0067930.

Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . The alteration may also be made by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US 2003 0157108 Presta . See also US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Antibodies with a bisecting N acetylglucosamine GlcNAc in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in e.g. WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. . Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported for example in WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. . See also WO 1998 58964 Raju and WO 1999 22764 Raju concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof. See also US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. US 2004 0072290 Umana et al. US 2003 0175884 Umana et al.

One preferred glycosylation antibody variant herein comprises an Fc region wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region has reduced fucose or lacks fucose which may improve ADCC function. Specifically antibodies are contemplated herein that have reduced fusose relative to the amount of fucose on the same antibody produced in a wild type CHO cell. That is they are characterized by having a lower amount of fucose than they would otherwise have if produced by native CHO cells. Preferably the antibody is one wherein less than about 10 of the N linked glycans thereon comprise fucose more preferably wherein less than about 5 of the N linked glycans thereon comprise fucose and most preferably wherein none of the N linked glycans thereon comprise fucose i.e. wherein the antibody is completely without fucose or has no fucose.

Such defucosylated or fucose deficient antibodies may be produced for example by culturing the antibodies in a cell line such as that disclosed in for example US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 US 2006 0063254 US 2006 0064781 US 2006 0078990 US 2006 0078991 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 and Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 . Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. 249 533 545 1986 US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta and WO 2004 056312 A1 Adams et al. especially at Example 11 and knockout cell lines such as alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase gene FUT8 knockout CHO cells Yamane Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87 614 2004 . See also Kanda et al. 94 680 8 2006 . US 2007 0048300 Biogen IDEC discloses a method of producing aglycosylated Fc containing polypeptides such as antibodies having desired effector function as well as aglycosylated antibodies produced according to the method and methods of using such antibodies as therapeutics all being applicable herein. Additionally U.S. Pat. No. 7 262 039 relates to a polypeptide having an alpha 1 3 fucosyltransferase activity including a method for producing a fucose containing sugar chain using the polypeptide.

In another embodiment the invention provides an antibody composition comprising the antibodies described herein having an Fc region wherein about 20 100 of the antibodies in the composition comprise a mature core carbohydrate structure in the Fc region that lacks a fucose.

The composition is additionally preferably one wherein the antibody binds an Fc RIII. The composition further is preferably such that the antibody has ADCC activity in the presence of human effector cells or has increased ADCC activity in the presence of human effector cells compared to the otherwise same antibody comprising a human wild type IgG1Fc region.

The composition is also preferably one wherein the antibody binds the Fc RIII with better affinity or mediates ADCC more effectively than a glycoprotein with a mature core carbohydrate structure including fucose attached to the Fc region of the glycoprotein. In addition the composition is preferably one wherein the antibody has been produced by a CHO cell preferably a Lec13 cell. The composition is also preferably one wherein the antibody has been produced by a mammalian cell lacking a fucosyltransferase gene more preferably the FUT8 gene.

In one aspect the composition is one wherein the antibody is free of bisecting N acetylglucosamine GlcNAc attached to the mature core carbohydrate structure. Alternatively the composition is such that the antibody has bisecting GlcNAc attached to the mature core carbohydrate structure.

In another aspect the composition is one wherein the antibody has one or more galactose residues attached to the mature core carbohydrate structure.

The composition still more preferably comprises at least about 10 afucosylated antibodies. The composition even more preferably comprises at least about 19 afucosylated antibodies. The composition most preferably comprises about 100 afucosylated antibodies.

The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates or antibody drug conjugates ADC comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

The use of antibody drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents e.g. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer Syrigos and Epenetos 19 605 614 1999 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 26 151 172 1997 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. 603 05 1986 Thorpe Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications A. Pinchera et al. eds pp. 475 506 1985 . Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 21 183 87 1986 . Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine. Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al. 92 19 1573 1581 2000 Mandler et al. 10 1025 1028 2000 and Mandler et al. 13 786 791 2002 maytansinoids EP 1391213 and Liu et al. 93 8618 8623 1996 and calicheamicin Lode et al. 58 2928 1998 and Hinman et al. Cancer Res. 53 3336 3342 1993 . Without being limited to any one theory the toxins may exert their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See for example WO 1994 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoid trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In the ADCs of the invention an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody through a linker L . The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Ab L D Formula I

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides and iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.

Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups that may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Domen et al. 510 293 302 1990 . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan and Stroh 3 138 146 1992 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides and iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide that does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such as streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin that is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

The ADCs herein are optionally prepared with cross linker reagents such as for example BMPS EMCS GMBS HBVS LC SMCC MBS MPBH SBAP SIA SIAB SMCC SMPB SMPH sulfo EMCS sulfo GMBS sulfo KMUS sulfo MBS sulfo SIAB sulfo SMCC sulfo SMPB and SVSB succinimidyl 4 vinylsulfone benzoate which are commercially available e.g. from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Rockford Ill. U.S.A . See pages 467 498 2003 2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.

The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers prolypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymer is attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

Therapeutic formulations of the antibodies used in accordance with the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing an antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG .

A further formulation and delivery method herein involves that described for example in WO 2004 078140 including the ENHANZE drug delivery technology Halozyme Inc. . This technology is based on a recombinant human hyaluronidase rHuPH20 . rHuPH20 is a recombinant form of the naturally occurring human enzyme approved by the FDA that temporarily clears space in the matrix of tissues such as skin. That is the enzyme has the ability to break down hyaluronic acid HA the space filling gel like substance that is a major component of tissues throughout the body. This clearing activity is expected to allow rHuPH20 to improve drug delivery by enhancing the entry of therapeutic molecules through the subcutaneous space. Hence when combined or co formulated with certain injectable drugs this technology can act as a molecular machete to facilitate the penetration and dispersion of these drugs by temporarily opening flow channels under the skin. Molecules as large as 200 nanometers may pass freely through the perforated extracellular matrix which recovers its normal density within approximately 24 hours leading to a drug delivery platform that does not permanently alter the architecture of the skin.

Hence the present invention includes a method of delivering an antibody herein to a tissue containing excess amounts of glycosaminoglycan comprising administering a hyaluronidase glycoprotein sHASEGP this protein comprising a neutral active soluble hyaluronidase polypeptide and at least one N linked sugar moiety wherein the N linked sugar moiety is covalently attached to an asparagine residue of the polypeptide to the tissue in an amount sufficient to degrade glycosaminoglycans sufficiently to open channels less than about 500 nanometers in diameter and administering the antibody to the tissue comprising the degraded glycosaminoglycans.

In another embodiment the invention includes a method for increasing the diffusion of an antibody herein that is administered to a subject comprising administering to the subject a sHASEGP polypeptide in an amount sufficient to open or to form channels smaller than the diameter of the antibody and administering the antibody whereby the diffusion of the therapeutic substance is increased. The sHASEGP and antibody may be administered separately or simultaneously in one formulation and consecutively in either order or at the same time.

Exemplary anti LT antibody formulations are described in WO 1998 56418 which include a liquid multidose formulation comprising the anti LT antibody at 40 mg mL 25 mM acetate 150 mM trehalose 0.9 benzyl alcohol 0.02 polysorbate 20 at pH 5.0 that has a minimum shelf life of two years storage at 2 8 C. Another anti LT formulation of interest comprises 10 mg mL antibody in 9.0 mg mL sodium chloride 7.35 mg mL sodium citrate dihydrate 0.7 mg mL POLYSORBATE 80 surfactant and Sterile Water for Injection pH 6.5. Yet another aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprises 10 30 mM sodium acetate from about pH 4.8 to about pH 5.5 preferably at pH 5.5 POLYSORBATE as a surfactant in an amount of about 0.01 0.1 v v trehalose at an amount of about 2 10 w v and benzyl alcohol as a preservative U.S. Pat. No. 6 171 586 . Lyophilized formulations adapted for subcutaneous administration are described for example in WO 1997 04801 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 267 958 Andya et al. . Such lyophilized formulations may be reconstituted with a suitable diluent to a high protein concentration and the reconstituted formulation may be administered subcutaneously to the mammal to be treated herein.

Crystallized forms of the antibody are also contemplated. See for example US 2002 0136719 Shenoy et al. .

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound a second medicament as noted above as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example it may be desirable to further provide a cytotoxic agent chemotherapeutic agent cytokine antagonist integrin antagonist or immunosuppressive agent e.g. one that acts on T cells such as cyclosporin or an antibody that binds T cells e.g. one that binds LFA 1 . The type and effective amounts of such second medicaments depend for example on the amount of antibody present in the formulation the type of disease or disorder or treatment the clinical parameters of the subjects and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein or from about 1 to 99 of the heretofore employed dosages. The preferred such medicaments are noted above.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed for example in 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semi permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid.

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

An antibody of the present invention may be used in for example in vitro ex vivo and in vivo therapeutic methods. Antibodies of the invention can be used as an antagonist to partially or fully block the specific LT activity in vitro ex vivo and or in vivo. Moreover at least some of the antibodies of the invention can neutralize antigen activity from other species. Accordingly the antibodies of the invention can be used to inhibit a specific antigen activity e.g. in a cell culture containing the antigen in human subjects or in other mammalian subjects having the antigen with which an antibody of the invention cross reacts e.g. chimpanzee baboon marmoset cynomolgus rhesus pig or mouse . In one embodiment the antibody of the invention can be used for inhibiting antigen activities by contacting the antibody with the antigen such that antigen activity is inhibited. Preferably the antigen is a human protein molecule.

In one embodiment an antibody of the invention can be used in a method for inhibiting an antigen in a subject suffering from a disorder in which the antigen activity is detrimental comprising administering to the subject an antibody of the invention such that the antigen activity in the subject is inhibited. Preferably the antigen is a human protein molecule and the subject is a human subject. Alternatively the subject can be a mammal expressing the antigen to which an antibody of the invention binds. Still further the subject can be a mammal into which the antigen has been introduced e.g. by administration of the antigen or by expression of an antigen transgene . An antibody of the invention can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes. Moreover an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non human mammal expressing an antigen with which the immunoglobulin cross reacts e.g. a primate pig or mouse for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention e.g. testing of dosages and time courses of administration . The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat inhibit delay progression of prevent delay recurrence of ameliorate or prevent autoimmune diseases disorders or conditions as defined herein.

In one aspect a blocking antibody of the invention is specific to a ligand antigen and inhibits the antigen activity by blocking or interfering with the ligand receptor interaction involving the ligand antigen thereby inhibiting the corresponding signal pathway and other molecular or cellular events. The invention also features receptor specific antibodies that do not necessarily prevent ligand binding but interfere with receptor activation thereby inhibiting any responses that would normally be initiated by the ligand binding. The invention also encompasses antibodies that either preferably or exclusively bind to ligand receptor complexes. An antibody of the invention can also act as an agonist of a particular antigen receptor thereby potentiating enhancing or activating either all or partial activities of the ligand mediated receptor activation.

The antibody may be a naked antibody or alternatively is conjugated with another molecule such as a cytotoxic agent. The antibody is preferably administered intravenously or subcutaneously most preferably subcutaneously.

In one embodiment the subject has never been previously treated with drug s such as immunosuppressive agent s to treat the disorder and in a particular embodiment has never been previously treated with a TNF antagonist. In an alternative embodiment the subject has been previously treated with drug s to treat the disorder including with a TNF antagonist.

In a still further aspect the patient has relapsed with the disorder. In an alternative embodiment the patient has not relapsed with the disorder.

In another aspect the antibody herein is the only medicament administered to the subject to treat the disorder. In an alternative aspect the antibody herein is one of the medicaments used to treat the disorder.

In a further aspect the subject only has RA as an autoimmune disorder. Alternatively the subject only has MS as an autoimmune disorder. Still alternatively the subject only has lupus or ANCA associated vasculitis or Sj gren s syndrome as an autoimmune disorder. In all cases autoimmune disorder is defined above.

In a still further embodiment the subject has an abnormal level of one or more regulatory cytokines anti nuclear antibodies ANA anti rheumatoid factor RF antibodies creatinine blood urea nitrogen anti endothelial antibodies anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA infiltrating CD20 cells anti double stranded DNA dsDNA antibodies anti Sm antibodies anti nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies anti phospholipid antibodies anti ribosomal P antibodies anti Ro SS A antibodies anti Ro antibodies anti La antibodies antibodies directed against Sj gren s associated antigen A or B SS A or SS B antibodies directed against centromere protein B CENP B or centromere protein C CENP C autoantibodies to ICA69 anti Smith antigen Sm antibodies anti nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies anti ribosomal P antibodies autoantibodies staining the nuclear or perinuclear zone of neutrophils pANCA anti antibodies cross reactive antibodies to GM1 ganglioside or GQ1b ganglioside anti acetylcholine receptor AchR anti AchR subtype or anti muscle specific tyrosine kinase MuSK antibodies serum anti endothelial cell antibodies IgG or anti desmoglein Dsg antibodies anti centromere anti topoisomerase 1 Scl 70 anti RNA polymerase or anti U3 ribonucleoprotein U3 RNP antibodies anti glomerular basement membrane GBM antibodies anti glomerular basement membrane GBM antibodies anti mitochondrial AMA or anti mitochondrial M2 antibodies anti thyroid peroxidase TPO anti thyroglobin TG or anti thyroid stimulating hormone receptor TSHR antibodies anti nucleic AN anti actin AA or anti smooth muscle antigen ASM antibodies IgA anti endomysial IgA anti tissue transglutaminase IgA anti gliadin or IgG anti gliadin antibodies anti CYP21A2 anti CYP11A1 or anti CYP17 antibodies anti ribonucleoprotein RNP or myosytis specific antibodies anti myelin associated glycoprotein MAG antibodies anti hepatitis C virus HCV antibodies anti GM1 ganglioside anti sulfate 3 glycuronyl paragloboside SGPG or IgM anti glycoconjugate antibodies IgM anti ganglioside antibody anti thyroid peroxidase TPO anti thyroglobin TG or anti thyroid stimulating hormone receptor TSHR antibodies anti myelin basic protein or anti myelin oligodendrocytic glycoprotein antibodies IgM rheumatoid factor antibodies directed against the Fc portion of IgG anti Factor VIII antibodies or a combination thereof.

The parameters for assessing efficacy or success of treatment of an autoimmune disorder which includes an autoimmune related disease will be known to the physician of skill in the appropriate disease. Generally the physician of skill will look for reduction in the signs and symptoms of the specific disease. The following are by way of examples.

In one embodiment the methods and compositions of the invention are useful to treat RA. RA is characterized by inflammation of multiple joints cartilage loss and bone erosion that leads to joint destruction and ultimately reduced joint function. Additionally since RA is a systemic disease it can have effects in other tissues such as the lungs eyes and bone marrow.

If the subject has RA which is a preferred indication herein preferably the antibodies herein induce a major clinical response in the subject.

The antibodies herein can be used as first line therapy in patients with early RA i.e. methotrexate MTX naive or in combination with e.g. MTX or cyclophosphamide. Alternatively the antibodies can be used in treatment as second line therapy for patients who were for example refractory to DMARD and or TNF inhibitor and or MTX in combination with e.g. MTX. The LT binding antibodies can also be administered in combination with B cell mobilizing agents such as integrin antibodies that mobilize B cells into the bloodstream for more effective killing. The LT binding antibodies are useful to prevent and control joint damage delay structural damage decrease pain associated with inflammation in RA and generally reduce the signs and symptoms in moderate to severe RA. The RA patient can be treated with the LT antibody prior to after or together with treatment with other drugs used in treating RA see combination therapy described herein . Patients who had previously failed DMARDs and or had an inadequate response to MTX alone are in one embodiment treated with a LT binding antibody. In another embodiment such patients are administered humanized LT binding antibody plus cyclophosphamide or LT binding antibody plus MTX. Most preferably the antibodies herein are administered with MTX for treatment of RA and not with high dose steroids.

One method of evaluating treatment efficacy in RA is based on American College of Rheumatology ACR criteria which are used to measure the percentage of improvement in tender and swollen joints among other things. The RA patient can be scored at for example ACR 20 20 percent improvement compared with no antibody treatment e.g baseline before treatment or treatment with placebo. Other ways of evaluating the efficacy of antibody treatment include X ray scoring such as the Sharp X ray score used to score structural damage such as bone erosion and joint space narrowing. Patients can also be evaluated for the prevention of or improvement in disability based on Health Assessment Questionnaire HAQ score AIMS score or SF 36 at time periods during or after treatment. The ACR 20 criteria may include 20 improvement in both tender painful joint count and swollen joint count plus a 20 improvement in at least three of five additional measures 

The ACR 50 and 70 are defined analogously. Preferably the patient is administered an amount of an LT binding antibody of the invention effective to achieve at least a score of ACR 20 preferably at least ACR 30 more preferably at least ACR 50 even more preferably at least ACR 70 and most preferably at least ACR 75.

Psoriatic arthritis has unique and distinct radiographic features. For psoriatic arthritis joint erosion and joint space narrowing can be evaluated by the Sharp score as well. The antibodies disclosed herein can be used to prevent the joint damage as well as reduce disease signs and symptoms of the disorder.

Yet another aspect of the invention is a method of treating lupus including systemic lupus erythematosus SLE and lupus nephritis by administering to the subject having such disease an effective amount of an antibody of the invention. For example SLEDAI scores provide a numerical quantitation of disease activity. The SLEDAI is a weighted index of 24 clinical and laboratory parameters known to correlate with disease activity with a numerical range of 0 103. See Gescuk and Davis 14 515 521 2002 . Antibodies to double stranded DNA are believed to cause renal flares and other manifestations of lupus. Patients undergoing antibody treatment can be monitored for time to renal flare which is defined as a significant reproducible increase in serum creatinine urine protein or blood in the urine. Alternatively or in addition patients can be monitored for levels of antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double stranded DNA. Treatments for SLE include high dose corticosteroids and or cyclophosphamide HDCC .

Spondyloarthropathies are a group of disorders of the joints including ankylosing spondylitis psoriatic arthritis and Crohn s disease. Treatment success can be determined by validated patient and physician global assessment measuring tools.

Various medications are used to treat psoriasis treatment differs directly in relation to disease severity. Patients with a more mild form of psoriasis typically utilize topical treatments such as topical steroids anthralin calcipotriene clobetasol and tazarotene to manage the disease while patients with moderate and severe psoriasis are more likely to employ systemic methotrexate retinoids cyclosporine PUVA and UVB therapies. Tars are also used. These therapies are disadvantageous due to safety concerns time consuming regimens and or inconvenient processes of treatment. Furthermore some require expensive equipment and dedicated space in the office setting. Such systemic medications can produce serious side effects including hypertension hyperlipidemia bone marrow suppression liver disease kidney disease and gastrointestinal upset. Also the use of phototherapy can increase the incidence of skin cancers. In addition to the inconvenience and discomfort associated with the use of topical therapies phototherapy and such systemic treatments also require cycling patients on and off therapy and monitoring lifetime exposure due to their side effects.

Treatment efficacy for psoriasis is assessed by monitoring changes in clinical signs and symptoms of the disease including Physician s Global Assessment PGA changes Psoriasis Area and Severity Index PASI scores and Psoriasis Symptom Assessment PSA compared with the baseline condition. The patient can be measured periodically throughout treatment on the Visual Analog Scale VAS used to indicate the degree of itching experienced at specific time points.

Ligand receptor binding studies may be carried out in any known assay method such as competitive binding assays direct and indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays. Cell based assays and animal models can be used to understand the interaction between the ligands and receptors identified herein and the development and pathogenesis of the conditions and diseases referred to herein.

In one approach mammalian cells may be transfected with the ligands or receptors described herein and the ability of the antibody herein to inhibit binding or activity is analyzed. Suitable cells can be transfected with the desired gene and monitored for activity. Such transfected cell lines can then be used to test the ability of antibody for example to modulate LT complex expression of the cells.

In addition primary cultures derived from transgenic animals can be used in the cell based assays. Techniques to derive continuous cell lines from transgenic animals are well known in the art. See e.g. Small et al. 5 642 648 1985 .

One suitable cell based assay is the addition of epitope tagged ligand e.g. LT to cells that have or express the respective receptor and the analysis of binding in the presence or absence of prospective antibodies by FACS staining with anti tag antibody. In another assay the ability of the antibody herein to inhibit the expression of LT complex on cells expressing such complex is assayed. For example suitable expressing cell lines are cultured in the presence or absence of prospective antibodies and the modulation of LT complex expression can be measured by H thymidine incorporation or cell number.

The results of the cell based in vitro assays can be further verified using in vivo animal models. Many animal models can be used to test the efficacy of the antibodies identified herein in relation to for instance immune related disease. The in vivo nature of such models makes them particularly predictive of responses in human patients. Animal models of immune related diseases include both non recombinant and recombinant transgenic animals. Non recombinant animal models include for example rodent e.g. murine models. Such models can be generated by introducing cells into syngeneic mice using standard techniques e.g. subcutaneous injection tail vein injection spleen implantation intraperitoneal implantation and implantation under the renal capsule.

Graft versus host disease is an example of a disease for which an animal model has been designed. Graft versus host disease occurs when immunocompetent cells are transplanted into immunosuppressed or tolerant patients. The donor cells recognize and respond to host antigens. The response can vary from life threatening severe inflammation to mild cases of diarrhea and weight loss. Graft versus host disease models provide a means of assessing T cell reactivity against MHC antigens and minor transplant antigens. A suitable procedure is described in detail in Eds. Cologan et al. John Wiley Sons Inc. 1994 unit 4.3.

An animal model for skin allograft rejection tests the ability of T cells to mediate in vivo tissue destruction to measure their role in anti viral immunity and is described for example in supra unit 4.4. Other transplant rejection models useful to test the antibodies herein include the allogeneic heart transplant models described by Tanabe et al. 58 23 1994 and Tinubu et al. 4330 4338 1994 .

Animal models for delayed type hypersensitivity provide an assay of cell mediated immune function. Delayed type hypersensitivity reactions are a T cell mediated in vivo immune response characterized by inflammation that does not reach a peak until after a period of time has elapsed after challenge with an antigen. These reactions also occur in tissue specific autoimmune diseases such as MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE a model for MS . A suitable exemplary model is described in detail in supra unit 4.5.

The collagen induced arthritis CIA model is considered a suitable model for studying potential drugs or biologics active in human arthritis because of the many immunological and pathological similarities to human RA the involvement of localized major histocompatibility complete class II restricted T helper lymphocyte activation and the similarity of histological lesions. Features of this CIA model that are similar to that found in RA patients include erosion of cartilage and bone at joint margins as can be seen in radiographs proliferative synovitis and symmetrical involvement of small and medium sized peripheral joints in the appendicular but not the axial skeleton. Jamieson et al. 20 324 9 1985 . Furthermore IL 1 and TNF appear to be involved in CIA as well as in RA. Joosten et al. 163 5049 5055 1999 . TNF neutralizing antibodies and separately TNFR.Fc reduced the symptoms of RA in this model Williams et al. 89 9784 9788 1992 Wooley et al. 151 6602 6607 1993 .

In this model for RA type II collagen is purified from bovine articular cartilage Miller 11 4903 1972 and used to immunized mice Williams et al 91 2762 1994 . Symptoms of arthritis include erythema and or swelling of the limbs as well as erosions or defects in cartilage and bone as determined by histology. This widely used model is also described for example by Holmdahl et al. 97 575 1989 in supra units 15.5 and in Issekutz et al. 88 569 1996 .

A model of asthma has been described in which antigen induced airway hyper reactivity pulmonary eosinophilia and inflammation are induced by sensitizing an animal with ovalbumin and challenging the animal with the same protein delivered by aerosol. Animal models such as rodent and non human primate models exhibit symptoms similar to atopic asthma in humans upon challenge with aerosol antigens. Suitable procedures to test the antibodies herein for suitability in treating asthma include those described by Wolyniec et al. 18 777 1998 .

Additionally the antibodies herein can be tested in the SCID SCID mouse model for immune disorders. For example as described by Schon et al. 3 183 1997 the mice demonstrate histopathologic skin lesions resembling psoriasis. Another suitable model is the human skin SCID mouse chimera prepared as described by Nickoloff et al. 146 580 1995 .

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention when used alone or in combination with a second medicament as noted below will depend for example on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The dosage is preferably efficacious for the treatment of that indication while minimizing toxicity and side effects.

The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 500 mg kg preferably about 0.1 mg kg to 400 mg kg of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 500 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 400 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg or 10 mg kg or 50 mg kg or 100 mg kg or 300 mg kg or 400 mg kg or any combination thereof may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week or every three weeks e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty e.g. about six doses of the antibody . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 to 500 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 to 400 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

For the treatment of an autoimmune disorder the therapeutically effective dosage will typically be in the range of about 50 mg mto about 3000 mg m preferably about 50 to 1500 mg m more preferably about 50 1000 mg m.

In treating disease the LT binding antibodies of the invention can be administered to the patient chronically or intermittently as determined by the physician of skill in the disease.

A patient administered a drug by intravenous infusion or subcutaneously may experience adverse events such as fever chills burning sensation asthenia and headache. To alleviate or minimize such adverse events the patient may receive an initial conditioning dose s of the antibody followed by a therapeutic dose. The conditioning dose s will be lower than the therapeutic dose to condition the patient to tolerate higher dosages.

The antibodies herein may be administered at a frequency that is within the skill and judgment of the practicing physician depending on various factors noted above for example the dosing amount. This frequency includes twice a week three times a week once a week bi weekly or once a month In a preferred aspect of this method the antibody is administered no more than about once every other week more preferably about once a month.

The antibodies used in the methods of the invention as well as any second medicaments are administered to a subject or patient including a human patient in accord with suitable methods such as those known to medical practitioners depending on many factors including whether the dosing is acute or chronic. These routes include for example parenteral intravenous administration e.g. as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time by subcutaneous intramuscular intra arterial intraperitoneal intrapulmonary intracerebrospinal intra articular intrasynovial intrathecal intralesional or inhalation routes e.g. intranasal . Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration. In addition the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Preferred routes herein are intravenous or subcutaneous administration most preferably subcutaneous.

The type of such second medicament depends on various factors including the type of autoimmune disorder the severity of the disease the condition and age of the patient the type and dose of first medicament employed etc.

The antibodies herein can be administered concurrently sequentially or alternating with the second medicament or upon non responsiveness with other therapy. Thus the combined administration of a second medicament includes co administration concurrent administration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all medicaments simultaneously exert their biological activities. All these second medicaments may be used in combination with each other or by themselves with the first medicament so that the expression second medicament as used herein does not mean it is the only medicament besides the first medicament respectively. Thus the second medicament need not be one medicament but may constitute or comprise more than one such drug.

These second medicaments as set forth herein are generally used in the same dosages and with the same administration routes as the first medicaments or from about 1 to 99 of the dosages of the first medicaments. If such second medicaments are used at all preferably they are used in lower amounts than if the first medicament were not present especially in subsequent dosings beyond the initial dosing with the first medicament so as to eliminate or reduce side effects caused thereby.

Anti human LT monoclonal antibodies 2C8 and 3F12 were generated as follows BALB c mice Charles River Laboratories Wilmington Del. were hyperimmunized by injection with 5 g dose of purified recombinant human LT expressed in Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. Genentech Lot 8360 2B see also Spriggs Tumor Necrosis Factor Basic Principles and Preclinical Studies DeVita et al. eds. J.B. Lippincott Company 1991 Ch. 16 pp. 354 377 Ruddle 4 327 332 1992 Wong et al. Tumor Necrosis Factor Academic Press 1989 pp. 195 215 Aggarwal et al. Wiley Liss Inc. 1990 pp. 375 384 and Paul et al. 6 407 438 1988 in DETOX adjuvant RIBI ImmunoChem Research Inc. Hamilton Mo. . Specifically 10 g LT 3 was mixed with 50 L of the adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into the rear footpads of mice strain BALB c on days 1 4 15 29 41 56 and 71. Serum was collected on Days 15 and 56 for detection of anti LT 3 specific antibodies by binding ELISA.

On day 75 the animals were sacrificed spleens were harvested and 3 10E7 cells were fused with 5 10E7 cells of the mouse myeloma line X63 Ag8.653 using 50 polyethylene glycol PEG 4000 by an established procedure Oi and Herzenberg in B. Mishel and S. Schiigi eds. W.J.Freeman Co. San Francisco Calif. 1980 . The fused cells were plated into 96 well microtiter plates at a density of 2 10E5 cells well containing HAT medium for selection Littlefield 145 709 1964 . After 12 days the supernatants were harvested and screened for antibody production by direct ELISA. The supernatants harvested from each hybridoma lineage were purified by affinity chromatography Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography FPLC Pharmacia Uppsala Sweden . The purified antibody preparations were then sterile filtered 0.2 m pore size Nalgene Rochester N.Y. and stored at 4 C. in phosphate buffered saline PBS .

Anti murine LT monoclonal antibody S5H3 was generated as follows Armenian hamsters were immunized with recombinant mouse LT 2 1 R D Systems Inc. 1008 LY . The hamsters were immunized with 2 g of antigen by footpad for 12 injections with an IP boost of 2 g of antigen once. The lymph nodes and spleen were fused by PEG treatment. Primary screening was done by ELISA on Immunogen vs. Genentech manufactured murine LT 6His murine LT with six histidines attached at the C terminal end . Detection was done with peroxidase conjugated AFFINIPURE goat anti Armenian hamster IgG H L Jackson ImmunoResearch 127 035 160 . Secondary screening was performed by FACS on irrelevant transfected HEK 293 cells vs. HEK 293 cells stably transfected with murine LT under G418 selection . Detection was performed using R phycoerythrin conjugated AFFINIPURE F ab 2 goat anti Armenian hamster IgG H L Jackson ImmunoResearch 127 116 160 . The hybridoma from which this antibody was derived was deposited with ATCC as Deposit No. PTA 7538 hybridoma murine Lymphotoxin alpha2 beta1 s5H3.2.2 .

All anti murine and anti human LT antibodies generated in these experiments were selected for recognition of LT 3. These were then screened for a blocking of binding of LT 3 to TNFR1 and TNFR11 by ELISA b binding of LT by ELISA and FACS of cells stably transfected with LT and LT and c blocking of LT interaction with the LT receptor by ELISA. Antibodies 3F12 2C8 and S5H3 were selected because they all bound and neutralized LT 3 and LT .

For use in the murine in vivo studies described below the hamster anti murine LT hybridoma was cloned as a hamster mouse chimera. Total RNA was extracted from S5H3 hybridoma cells using a RNEASY MINI kit Qiagen and the manufacturer s suggested protocol. RT PCR was accomplished using a Qiagen ONE STEP kit and primers were designed to amplify the light and heavy chain variable domains and add restriction enzyme sites for cloning.

For construction of the light chain of this chimeric antibody S5H3 two sequential cloning steps were used. In the first step RT PCR ClaI and AscI sites were added using primer set one allowing cloning into a pRK based vector simply to amplify DNA for sequencing. After the DNA sequence of the light chain variable domain was obtained a round of PCR was performed using this plasmid as template in order to add EcoRV and KpnI sites that are compatible with the expression vector.

For construction of the heavy chain of S5H3 likewise two cloning steps were used. Specifically RT PCR was used to amplify cDNA and add ClaI and AscI sites for cloning into a vector for sequencing. Subsequently this plasmid was used as template for PCR to add BsiWI and ApaI sites that are compatible with the expression vector.

The LT 3 binding ELISA was carried out as follows Microtiter wells were coated with a 1 g ml LT 3 in 50 mM carbonate buffer solution 50 l well overnight. The unadsorbed solution was aspirated from the wells. Wells were blocked with 200 L PBS containing 5 mg ml bovine serum albumin PBS BSA for 2 hours. 50 L of test sample appropriately diluted in PBS BSA was added to each well incubated for one hour and washed with PBS containing 0.05 TWEEN 20 surfactant. 100 L of horse radish peroxidase labeled goat anti mouse IgG in PBS BSA buffer was added to each well and incubated for one hour. Each well was washed with PBS 0.05 TWEEN 20 surfactant and then citrate phosphate buffer pH 5 containing 0.1 mg o phenylenediamine ml substrate solution and aqueous 30 HOwas added to each well. The wells were incubated for 30 minutes then the reaction was stopped with 50 L 2.5M sulfuric acid HSO and absorbance was read at 490 nm.

The LT 3 blocking ELISA the LT binding ELISA and FACS assays and the LT blocking ELISA were carried out by procedures described further below.

Because the hybridoma cell line 3F12.2D3 was lost from the frozen cell line bank anti LT monoclonal antibody protein purified from ascites 3F12.2D3 was submitted for sequencing at a concentration of about 3.0 mg mL in PBS. The antibody Ab was separated on 4 20 TRIS HCl SDS PAGE under reducing conditions and each resolved heavy chain HC and light chain LC was subjected to N terminal sequencing 25 30 residues were sequenced to establish monoclonality. The HC was found to be blocked with a pyroglutamyl group that made the N terminal amino acid inaccessible to Edman sequencing. The blocking group was subsequently removed using the pyroglutamate aminopeptidase enzyme PGAP and the HC chain subjected to sequencing again. Both the HC and LC were confirmed to be monoclonal. The Ab was then treated with various enzymatic and chemical cleavages according to a strategy described in 35 77 86 2006 . In brief these consisted of the enzymes trypsin endo Lys C Asp N and chemical treatments with CNBr and dilute acid Asp Pro cleavage .

Chemical cleavages generated a mixture of peptides that were sequenced on model 494 PROCISE sequencers and identified using Genentech s SEQSORT program SEQSORT is a utility program designed to make the output produced by the programs in Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center s sequence analysis suite more manageable and readable . These chemical cleavages allowed identification of the constant region of the HC and LC by identity with antibodies in protein sequence databases. Peptides generated from the enzymatic digestions were collected from capillary RP HPLC separations and the peptide masses measured using MALDI TOF analysis. Peptides with masses that did not match the constant regions were subjected to further analysis using Edman degradation or liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry LC MS MS on an LTQ FT mass spectrometer. Sequences of the variable regions of the HC and LC were derived from peptides with overlapping sequences obtained by the various proteolytic cleavages.

For analysis of the peptides by LC MS MS a micro capillary C18 reverse phase chromatography column 0.15 150 mm i.d. 5 m 300 was employed using a flow rate of 1 mL minute on an AGILENT 1100 series capillary LC system. Solvent A was applied and a gradient from 2 to 80 solvent B was applied solvent A consisting of 0.1 v v formic acid in water and solvent B consisting of 0.1 v v formic acid in acetonitrile. The LC was coupled in line with the LTQ FT mass spectrometer and peptides with m z between 350 and 1800 were analyzed in data dependent mode with the five most abundant species in each full mass range survey scan being selected for collision induced dissociation CID . The resulting CID spectra were screened with the search program MASCOT to find exact matches to database sequences and potentially novel sequences were determined by manual de novo interpretation. Peptides that could not be completely sequenced or that contained the isobaric amino acid pairs of leucine isoleucine and glutamine lysine were analyzed further using Edman degradation.

A Fab portion of anti LT was obtained from papain digestion of the intact antibody followed by size exclusion chromatography. Masses of both heavy chain and light chain components of the Fab were obtained by quadruple TOF mass spectrometry after inter chain disulfides were reduced. The experimental masses corresponded to those calculated based on the obtained sequences of the heavy chain and light chain to within 0.5 Da each.

Using a pRK based plasmid containing the gene for the light chain of anti TGF beta monoclonal antibody 2G7 WO 2005 97832 as a template and the amino acid sequences derived above several rounds of oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis were performed to derive the gene for the light chain of chimeric antibody 3F12. Similarly the heavy chain of monoclonal antibody 2G7 was the template for construction of the heavy chain of 3F12. Both light and heavy chain templates contained the human constant domains C kappa for the light chain and CH1 hinge CH2 and CH3 of IgG1 isotype for the heavy chain. The oligonucleotides used in the synthesis are given below for the light and heavy chains.

Since the original 3F12 murine monoclonal antibody had the isotype of IgG2b the murine constant domains for the light and heavy chains of this isotype were swapped for the human constant domains in the chimera giving a fully murine antibody. For comparison the murine IgG2a isotype was also constructed. DNA for the light and heavy chain of each variant was co transfected into an adenovirus transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 for transient expression and protein was purified from conditioned media using Protein A affinity chromatography. Binding to LT in an ELISA format was compared between the original 3F12 monoclonal antibody from ascites and the synthetic mulgG2a and mulgG2b variants.

Briefly a NUNC MAXISORP plate was coated with two micrograms per ml of LT as described in Example 1 above in 50 mM carbonate buffer pH 9.6 overnight at 4 C. and then blocked with 0.5 BSA 10 PPM PROCLIN in PBS at room temperature for 1 hour. Serial dilutions of samples in PBS containing 0.5 BSA 0.05 TWEEN 10 PPM PROCLIN were incubated on the plates for 2 hours. After washing bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti human Fc Jackson ImmunoResearch using 3 3 5 5 tetramethyl benzidine Kirkegaard Perry Laboratories Gaithersburg Md. as substrate. Absorbance was read at 450 nm. Both the IgG2a and IgG2b cloned variants bound similarly to the 3F12 antibody purified from ascites indicating that the correct sequence had been synthesized.

Using the amino acid sequence of the chimeric clone the CDR residues of the light and heavy chain were identified Kabat . Oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis was used to swap these CDRs onto vectors containing the coding sequences of the light and heavy chains of humanized anti TGF 2G7 version 5 WO 2005 97832 obtaining the CDRswap version of 3F12. The framework sequences thus derived are for the VL kappa subgroup I and VH subgroup III consensus sequences respectively 

After expression and purification as described above binding of the CDRswap to LT was compared to that of the chimera. Binding for the CDR swap was almost completely lost.

To restore binding of the humanized antibody mutations were constructed using DNA from the CDRswap as template. Using a computer generated model these mutations were designed to change human framework residues to their murine counterparts at positions where the change might affect CDR conformation of the antibody antigen surface. Mutants and their relative binding by ELISA as described above are shown in Table 1 below. Changing isoleucine 69 to phenylalanine to give v2 increased binding significantly as did the change Leu78Ala while the change Asn73Lys gave no improvement over the CDRswap. Combining Ile69Phe and Leu78Ala gave version 5 which binds LT approximately 5 fold less well than the chimera in this ELISA assay format.

Two variants were made to move the framework sequence closer to the human consensus. Version 6 with the changes Lys24Arg and Ser25Ala was equivalent in binding to version 5. However an attempt to change the usual aspartic acid at position 94 to the consensus arginine version 7 resulted in almost complete loss of binding.

All animal studies described below using the 3F12 chimera refer to the original chimera and not chimera2 as described in the footnote above.

For identification of which residues and regions in the CDRs might be most important for binding LT and thus candidates for inclusion in phage display libraries for affinity maturation partial alanine scanning was performed using v5 as single strand template for oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis.

As shown in Table 2 several residues were found which when mutated to alanine produced a loss or gain in binding to LT .

Thus versions 14 15 17 20 21 and 12 have positions where changes could be made to improve binding affinity and it is expected that conservative substitutions or even non conservative in some instances as determined by the skilled artisan by routine testing could be made at those respective positions to increase binding.

The variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the murine anti LT antibody 2C8 that bound and neutralized LT 3 and LT were cloned and formatted as a murine human chimeric antibody essentially as described above in Example 1 for the cloning of S5H3.

The variable domain of the light chain was cloned into vector pRK.LPG3.HumanKappa containing the human kappa constant domain while the heavy chain variable domain was cloned into expression vector pRK.LPG4.HumanHC encoding the full length human IgG1 constant domains. These vectors are derivatives of previously described vectors for expression of IgGs in 293 cells Shields et al. 276 6591 6604 2000 and Gorman et al. 2 3 10 1990 . For transient expression of antibody these plasmids were co transfected into 293 cells or CHO mammalian cell lines and the protein was purified as described in Example 1 above.

Humanization of the anti LT antibody 2C8 was carried out in a series of site directed mutagenesis steps. Using the sequence of the variable domains of the chimera the CDR residues of the light and heavy chains were identified by comparing the amino acid sequence of these domains with the sequences of known antibodies Kabat et al. supra . The CDRs were defined based on sequence hypervariability Kabat et al. supra and are shown in .

The CDR swap of 2C8 was made using oligonucleotide site directed mutagenesis wherein the CDR regions were put onto separate pRK5 based vectors for the light and heavy chains respectively. These vectors contain the light chain human kappa I constant domain or for the heavy chain vector the human IgG1 constant domains CH1 hinge CH2 and CH3 Gorman 1 1 p 36 47 1990 .

Comparison to other humanized antibodies indicated that the light chain of 2C8 is very similar to the light chain of humanized anti HER2 antibody 4D5 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 while the heavy chain of 2C8 is similar in sequence to anti TGF 2G7 WO 2005 97832 . Therefore a vector containing the light chain of rhuMAb 4D5 was used as the template for the construction of the light chain of 2C8. Site directed mutagenesis was performed on a deoxyuridine containing template derived from this vector using oligonucleotides with light chain sequences shown in Table 3. Additionally the oligonucleotide CA1730 was used to revert the framework 3 sequence to that of the human kappa I consensus.

For the heavy chain the deoxyuridine containing template was derived from a vector containing the heavy chain of humanized antibody 2G7 WO 2005 97832 using oligonucleotides shown in Table 4. The framework was converted to consensus using oligonucleotides KM55 KM56 and KM61.

The light and heavy chains comprising the CDR swap v10 thus derived were co transfected into an adenovirus transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 Graham et al. supra . Antibodies were purified from culture supernatants using protein A SEPHAROSE CL 4B resin then buffer exchanged into 10 mM sodium succinate 140 mM NaCl pH 6.0 and concentrated using a CENTRICON 10 concentrator Amicon .

For measuring relative binding affinities of the CDR swap and subsequent 2C8 variants to human LT a plate based ELISA was used as described above.

As shown in Table 5 the CDR swap v10 shows no binding in the LT ELISA. Version 2 and subsequent versions were constructed to regain this binding. Version 2 regains binding equivalent to the chimera but contains seven non consensus residues. Further variants were studied to obtain a framework as close to consensus as possible while still retaining or improving binding relative to the chimera. Version 12 has binding equivalent to by ELISA or slightly better than by BIACORE analysis the chimera and retains only five non consensus residues. The light and heavy chain sequences of versions 7 and 12 are provided in .

A humanized 2C8 monoclonal antibody with improved affinity to LT was selected from a library of monovalent Fab displayed on phage. A template was generated that displays the humanized 2C8.v2 Fab and contains a stop codon in the CDR L3. Oligonucleotides listed in Table 6 were designed to soft randomize specific CDR L3 and CDR H3 residues.

Three rounds of sorting on LT were used to selectively capture high affinity Fab molecules with less than 2 nM binding to the antigen. For the first round phage were captured for 2 hours against 2 g ml plate coated LT at ambient temperature. The second and third rounds of selection were performed at ambient temperature by capturing phage for 30 minutes with 2 nM biotinylated LT in solution phase followed by capture on neutravidin coated plates. The highest affinity clone was identified using a competitive ELISA. Constant concentrations of phage clones normalized by solid phase LT binding OD were incubated with increasing concentrations of LT 0 50 nM in solution before capture on a plate coated with 2 g ml LT . One clone demonstrated a 10 fold improvement in competition with LT over wild type 2C8.v2. DNA sequencing of this phagemid clone revealed two amino acid changes from the wild type 2C8 sequence in CDR L3 glutamine at position 89 was changed to a glutamic acid and histidine at position 90 was changed to a serine. These two CDR L3 changes were made by site directed mutagenesis on the wild type 2C8.v7 light chain. When v7 light chain was transfected into 293 cells with the 2C8.v12 heavy chain to give 2C8.v16 the resultant antibody demonstrated a two fold improvement in IgG binding to LT by ELISA when compared to 2C8.v2 Table 5 .

To enhance stability by removing a potential aspartic acid isomerization site asp 53 in heavy chain CDR2 was changed to alanine. The resultant 2C8 variant vX had a 3.5 fold and 3 fold improvement in binding to LT by ELISA compared to the 2C8.v2 and 2C8.chimera respectively Table 5 .

Table 7 below shows how residue changes in CDR L3 regions ranked as to ability to bind LT by ELISA analysis.

It can be seen from this table that the best clones were A8 G7 and H6 which all bound rhLT with higher affinity than the wild type clone.

AIA differs from collagen induced arthritis CIA described below in that instead of injecting the antigen bovine collagen type II antibodies recognizing type II collagen are injected. In this way adaptive B and T cell responses are circumvented to directly induce effector functions on macrophages and neutrophils through Fc receptor and complement mediated activation.

AIA was induced in mice by i.v. injection of a combination of four different monoclonal antibodies generated by the ARTHROGEN CIA mouse B hybridoma cell lines. Three of the monoclonal antibodies recognize autoantigenic epitopes clustered within an 84 amino acid residue fragment LyC2 the smallest arthritogenic fragment of type II collagen of CB11 and the fourth monoclonal antibody reacts with LyC1. All four antibodies recognize the conserved epitopes shared by various species of type II collagen and crossreact with homologous and heterologous type II collagen.

All groups n 5 group received 2 mg of a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies i.v. in 100 l PBS on day 0 followed by 25 g LPS i.p. in 50 l PBS on day 3. Animals were treated on Day 1 preventive or Day 4 therapeutic with 10 mg kg control isotype anti ragweed hamster murine chimeric LT antibody S5H3 as a surrogate for the anti human LT antibodies anti LT.Fc mutant an anti LT antibody with DANA mutations in the Fc region as described below or TNFRII.Fc a TNFR.Ig immunoadhesin intraperitoneally or subcutaneously. Swelling of the paws was monitored for 14 days. Each paw was given a score of 0 4 for a total maximum of 16 per animal.

DANA mutations in the anti LT.Fc mutant used in this Example and others below refer to two single position changes in the Fc region of mouse or human IgG. These changes are D Aspartic Acid to A Alanine in position 265 and N Asparagine to A Alanine in position 297. The DANA mutant was constructed by introducing alanine residues into positions 265 and 297 of mouse or human IgG by a PCR based site directed mutagenesis method GENE TAILOR Invitrogen Corp. .

In conclusion animals treated with the hamster mouse chimera S5H3 had significantly reduced clinical scores as compared to animals treated with S5H3.DANA or control. S5H3 demonstrated both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in this animal model.

In RA the synovial membrane of multiple joints can become inflamed leading to destruction of joint tissues including bone and cartilage. The synovium of RA can be highly inflammatory in nature and is typically characterized by lymphocyte and mononuclear cell infiltration T cell and antigen pressing cell APC activation B cell immunoglobulin Ig secretion and pro inflammatory cytokine production Potocnik et al. 31 213 1990 Wernick et al. 28 742 1985 Ridley et al. 29 84 1990 Thomas et al. 152 2613 1994 and Thomas et al. 156 3074 1996 . Chronically inflamed synovium is usually accompanied by a massive CD4 T cell infiltration Pitzalis et al. 18 1397 1988 and Morimoto et al. 84 817 1988 .

Collagen induced arthritis CIA is an animal model for human RA which resembles human disease and can be induced in susceptible strains of mice by immunization with heterologous type II collagen CII Courtenay et al. 283 665 1980 and Cathcart et al. 54 26 1986 . Both CD4 T cells and antibodies to CII are required to develop CIA. Transfer of anti CII to na ve animals only leads to partial histo pathology that is quite different from CIA and complete symptoms of CIA do not develop Holmdahl et al. 19 295 1986 . In contrast adoptive transfer of both CD4 T cells and anti CII antibodies from CII immunized mice to na ve recipients completely reconstitutes the symptoms of classical CIA Seki et al. 148 3093 1992 . Involvement of both T cells and antibodies in CIA is also consistent with histo pathological findings of inflamed joints in CIA. Thus agents that block B cell or T cell functions or inhibit pro inflammatory cytokines induced by T cells may be efficacious to prevent or treat arthritis. Indeed depletion of CD4 T cells blockade of CD40 CD40L interactions neutralization of TNF or blocking of IL 1 receptors can lead to prevention of CIA in mice Maini et al. 144 195 1995 Joosten et al. 39 797 1996 and Durie et al. 261 1328 1993 .

In the CIA model used herein DBA 1J mice were immunized with 100 g bovine collagen type II in 100 l of Complete Freund s Adjuvant CFA on Day 0 and Day 21 intradermally. At Day 24 post immunization mice were randomly divided into treatment groups. Animals were subcutaneously treated either with 6 mg kg in 100 l anti ragweed IgG2a monoclonal antibody control antibody or with hamster mouse chimeric anti LT antibody S5H3 anti LT .Fc mutant or murine TNFRII Ig at 4 mg kg in 100 PBS. Animals were treated three times weekly for the duration of the study. Limbs of animals were examined daily for signs of joint infiltration using a grading system of 1 4 for each joint giving a maximum score of 16.

In a CIA preventative model the use of hamster murine anti LT antibody S5H3 and TNFRII.Fc reduced the average clinical score over the period of days up through 70 days versus the anti S5H3.DANA Fc mutant and isotype control anti ragweed IgG2a monoclonal antibody . See showing comparable efficacy in the CIA preventative murine model of the antibody S5H3 with TNFR.Ig.

Experimental autoimmune allergic encephalomyelitis EAE is an inflammatory condition of the central nervous system with similarities to MS. In both diseases circulating leukocytes penetrate the blood brain barrier and damage myelin resulting in impaired nerve conduction and paralysis. The EAE murine model transgenic mouse preventative model has been described as a model for human MS Grewal et al. 273 1864 1867 1996 .

MBPT cell receptor transgenic mice 10 to 15 week old male and female adult MBP TCR transgenic mice bred from an animal breeding pair obtained from Dr. Richard Flavell Howard Hughes Medical Institute Yale University were immunized with 10 g of MBPin 100 l of CFA subcutaneously. On Days 1 and 2 all mice were additionally injected intraperitoneally with pertussis toxin at 200 ng 10 l mouse. On Day 0 mice n 10 group received either anti gp120 IgG1 monoclonal antibody control antibody or hamster mouse chimera anti LT antibody S5H3 at 6 mg kg in 100 l i.p. and then 6 mg kg in 100 l PBS s.c. three times weekly.

Animals were evaluated daily for clinical signs using the following grading system 0 Normal mouse no overt signs of disease 1 Limp tail or hind limb weakness but not both 2 Limp tail and hind limb weakness 3 Partial hind limb paralysis 4 Complete hind limb paralysis 5 Moribund.

The results are shown in . The disease score was lower for the anti LT treated mice than for the control group only reaching clinical scores of 3 versus clinical scores of over 4 for the control during the study. The results show that the antibody S5H3 delayed onset and severity of EAE disease in these transgenic mice suggesting that the antibody treatment protected the mice from developing overt EAE.

The immune response to i.v. injected trinitrophenol TNP FICOLL is very high in most mouse strains allowing one to assay the relative safety of an antibody administered to such mice by measuring various isotype levels in the mice.

BALB c mice n 12 group were treated on Day 0 with either anti ragweed isotype control hamster mouse anti LT antibody S5H3 anti LT.Fc mutant or CTLA4 Fc as a positive control at 6 mg kg in 100 l PBS intra peritoneally. Treatment continued three times per week for 5 weeks. Mice were immunized on Day 1 with TNP OVA 100 g in 2 mg of alum per mouse intra peritoneally and on Day 29 with TNP OVA 50 g in PBS per mouse intra peritoneally. Serum was collected on Days 0 14 and 35 for determination of the anti TNP Ig isotypes IgM IgG1 and IgG2a by standard ELISA.

The results shown in wherein the data are represented as Log 10 titers of anti TNP IgM IgG1 and IgG2a respectively indicate that the isotype control S5H3 antibody and DANA Fc mutant antibody exhibited similar patterns for each of the isotype levels whereas the CTLA4.Fc immunoadhesin acted differently. This indicates that there would be little if any immune response in a patient to the administration of the S5H3 antibody herein.

BALB c mice n 10 group were treated on Day 0 with either anti ragweed IgG2a isotype control hamster mouse anti LT antibody S5H3 or TNFRII.Fc at 6 mg kg in 100 l PBS intra peritoneally. Treatment continued three times per week for 10 days. Mice were immunized on Day 1 with TNP FICOLL 100 g i.p. in 100 l PBS intra peritoneally. Serum was collected on Days 0 and 10 for determination of the anti TNP Ig isotypes IgM IgG1 IgG2a and IgG3 by standard ELISA.

Graft versus host disease GVHD occurs when immunocompetent cells are transplanted into immunosuppressed or tolerant patients. The donor T cells recognize host antigens and become activated secrete cytokines proliferate and differentiate into effector cells. This response is known as graft versus host reaction GVHR . The GVHR response is a multi organ syndrome and the effects can vary from life threatening severe inflammation to mild cases of diarrhea and weight loss. GVHD models in mice have been used to model the clinical disorders of acute and chronic GVHR that occur after bone marrow transplantation and autoimmune diseases. A general procedure is described in supra unit 4.3.

SCID mice were reconstituted with human PBMCs purified from a LEUKOPACK available from blood banks such as Interstate Blood Bank Memphis Tenn. of a normal donor by FICOLL polysaccharide gradient. All mice n 10 group were sub lethally irradiated with 350 rads using a Cesium 137 source. Two hours after irradiation mice were injected with 50 million human PBMCs mouse in 200 l PBS intravenously. Immediately after cell injection mice were treated i.p. either with 300 g of trastuzumab human IgG1 isotype control antibody anti LT chimeric antibody 2C8 or CTLA4 Fc in 100 l saline two times week for three weeks. POLYMYXIN B 110 mg liter and NEOMYCIN 1.1 g liter antibiotics were added to the drinking water for five days post irradiation. Mice were monitored for GVHD as indicated by survival.

The results are shown in and indicate that as compared to the isotype control the 2C8 antibody significantly increased survival of the human SCID mice preventing GVHD as compared to anti LT 2C8 Fc mutant and the isotype control with the CTLA4.Fc immunoadhesin being the best in this model of the molecules tested. Thus the anti LT antibodies herein are expected to be useful in the prevention and or treatment of graft versus host disease. Further the results show that depletion of LT positive cells is required for efficacy in this model since the 2C8 Fc mutant DANA did not show efficacy.

Microtiter wells were coated with 1 g ml human LT 3 in 50 mM carbonate buffer solution 100 l well overnight. The unabsorbed solution was decanted from the wells. Wells were blocked with 150 L PBS containing 5 mg ml bovine serum albumin PBS BSA for 1 2 hour. 100 L of appropriately diluted test sample anti LT chimeric antibody 2C8 or 3F12 diluted in PBS BSA was added to each well incubated for one hour and washed with PBS containing 0.05 TWEEN 20 surfactant. 100 L of biotin labeled rat anti mouse IgG in PBS BSA buffer was then added to each well and incubated for one hour. The plate was then washed with PBS 0.05 TWEEN 20 surfactant and streptavidin horseradish peroxidase SA HRP was added for 30 minutes to each well. Each well was washed with PBS 0.05 TWEEN 20 surfactant and bound HRP was measured with a solution of tetramethylbenzidine TMB HO. After 15 minutes the reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 l of 1M phosphoric acid. The absorbance at 450 nm was read with a reference wavelength of 650 nm.

The above procedure was repeated using murine LT 3 instead of human LT 3 and hamster mouse chimeric anti LT antibody S5H3 and anti LT.Fc mutant as the antibody tested for binding ability. shows that both S5H3 and the anti LT .Fc mutant bound to murine LT 3.

For the LT ELISA microtiter wells were coated with 1 g ml murine LT 1 2 in 50 mM carbonate buffer solution 100 l well overnight. The unabsorbed solution was decanted from the wells. Wells were blocked with 150 L PBS containing 5 mg ml bovine serum albumin PBS BSA for 1 2 hours. 100 L of an appropriately diluted test sample anti LT chimeric antibody S5H3 or anti LT .Fc mutant diluted in PBS BSA was added to each well incubated for one hour and washed with PBS containing 0.05 TWEEN 20 surfactant. 100 L of biotin labeled rat anti mouse IgG in PBS BSA buffer was then added to each well and incubated for one hour. The plate was then washed with PBS 0.05 TWEEN 20 surfactant and streptavidin horseradish peroxidase SA HRP was added for 30 minutes to each well. Each well was washed with PBS 0.05 TWEEN 20 surfactant and bound HRP was measured with a solution of tetramethylbenzidine TMB HO. After 15 minutes the reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 l of 1M phosphoric acid. The absorbance at 450 nm was read with a reference wavelength of 650 mm.

A FACS assay was used to determine binding of anti LT antibody to the LT on the surface of cells complexed with LT . For human LT 293 cells were transfected with full length human LT and human LT human LT sequence GenBank Ref NM000595 human LT sequence GenBank Ref NM002341 to generate stable human LT expressing cell lines. Cells were incubated with 1 5 g ml of anti LT chimeric antibody 3F12 or 2C8 human LT R.huIgG1 or huIgG1 isotype control trastuzumab for 20 minutes in PBS with 2 FBS. Cells were washed and incubated with anti human Ig PE secondary antibodies for detection.

For murine LT SVT2 cells were transfected with full length murine LT and murine LT murine LT sequence GenBank Ref NM010735 murine LT sequence GenBank Ref NM008518 to generate stable murine LT expressing cell lines. Surface LT was detected with hamster murine chimera S5H3 anti LT.S5H3.Fc mutant muLT R.IgG2a or isotype control anti IL122 mulgG2a directly conjugated to ALEXA 647 fluorophore for 20 minutes in PBS with 2 FBS. Cells were washed aspirated and resuspended in PBS with 2 FBS. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCALIBUR dual laser using CELLQUEST software and results analyzed on a FLOWJO analyzer Treestar .

When CD4 T cells mature from thymus and enter into the peripheral lymph system they usually maintain their naive phenotype before encountering antigens specific for their T cell receptor Sprent et al. 20 551 79 2002 . The binding to specific antigens presented by APC causes T cell activation. Depending on the environment and cytokine stimulation CD4 T cells differentiate into a Th1 or Th2 phenotype and become effector or memory cells Sprent et al. supra and Murphy et al. 2 12 933 44 2000 . This process is known as primary activation. Having undergone primary activation CD4 T cells become effector or memory cells they maintain their phenotype as Th1 or Th2. Once these cells encounter antigen again they undergo secondary activation but this time the response to antigen will be quicker than the primary activation and results in the production of effector cytokines as determined by the primary activation Sprent et al. supra and Murphy et al. supra .

For primary activation conditions na ve T cells were activated by anti CD3 anti CD28 and specific cytokines depending on whether Th1 or Th2 was being examined. In particular human Th1 and Th2 cell lines were generated by stimulating human PBMC with plate bound anti CD3 and anti CD28 10 g ml and 5 g ml respectively BD PharMingen . On Day 1 to induce Th2 differentiation interleukin IL 4 5 ng ml R D Systems Inc. anti IL 12 5 g ml R D Systems Inc. Minneapolis Minn. and anti interferon IFN gamma 5 g ml R D Systems Inc. were added. For Th1 differentiation on Day 1 IL 12 1 ng ml R D Systems Inc. IFN gamma 10 ng ml R D Systems Inc. and anti IL 4 1 g ml R D Systems Inc. were added. Cells were restimulated twice at Days 7 and 14.

For FACS analysis cell surface staining to determine binding of the antibodies to Th1 and Th2 two days after final stimulation the activated human T cells Th1 Th2 cell lines were incubated with anti LT antibody 2C8 1 g ml 3F12 1 g ml LT R.Fc 1 g ml TNFRII.Fc 1 g ml or huIgG1 isotype control 1 g ml all directly conjugated to ALEXA FLUOR 647 fluorophore Invitrogen Corp. for 20 minutes in PBS with 2 FBS. Cells were washed aspirated and re suspended in PBS with 2 FBS. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCALIBUR dual laser using CELLQUEST software and results analyzed on a FLOWJO analyzer Treestar .

Since LT 3 and LT 1 2 were found to be expressed on human Th17 cells as well as human Th1 cells via FACS analysis it would be expected that the anti LT antibodies herein including chimeric 2C8 2C8.v2 and 2C8.vX described in Examples 3 and 18 would similarly to Th1 and Th2 bind to human Th17 cells and hence be useful in treating many autoimmune diseases including MS they drive EAE in murine models and lupus as well as RA and IBD such as Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis.

Hence the same experiment described above was performed except for using anti LT humanized antibody 2C8.vX as the LT antibody and using a Th17 cell line as well as the Th1 cell line but not a Th2 cell line. The human Th17 cell lines were generated by stimulating human PBMC with anti CD3 and anti CD28 as noted above and with IL 23 10 ng ml R D Systems Inc. anti IFN gamma 10 g ml R D Systems Inc. and anti IL 12 10 g ml R D Systems Inc. . This experiment showed that in fact antibody 2C8.vX bound to human Th17 cells as well as human Th1 cells but not to resting cells. See .

A FACS assay was used to determine binding of anti LT antibodies to the LT on the surface of primary human cells.

Affinity maturation of the antibody 2C8 noted in Example 3 led to the humanized antibody 2C8.vX. The light chain and heavy chain variable regions and CDRs of this antibody are shown in respectively along with the CDRs.

Epitope mapping indicates that this molecule has a partial overlap with the receptor binding site. Activated rhesus T and B cells express surface LT . The antibody 2C8.vX bound crossreacted with rhesus surface LT as determined by FACS and rhesus soluble LT 3 as determined by FORTEBIO octet .

The results in show total CFSE positive human cells at day 2 for isotype control 2C8.vX and 2C8.vX.DANA mutant and indicate that depletion was best with the vX antibody. show the results of gating using the CD4 CD8 and CD19 antibodies respectively indicating that the vX antibody was best at depleting LT positive T and B cells as compared to isotype control and the DANA mutant.

In summary the antibody 2C8.vX depletes LT expressing cells in an in vitro ADCC assay and in vivo in two human SCID GVHD models. It also blocks LT 3 and LT 1 2 in functional cell assays using HUVEC cells and 293 LT R cells respectively. Further it cross reacts with non human primate NHP lymphotoxin as determined by activated rhesus primary cells and the LT 3 rhesus protein.

When tested for binding and blocking LT 3 and LT using the assays noted above 3F12.v14 bound and blocked these molecules as well as did antibody 2c8.vX.

The antibodies herein may be altered so that they lack fucose by culturing them using a cell line or technology disclosed in US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 US 2006 0063254 US 2006 0064781 US 2006 0078990 US 2006 0078991 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 or Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 622 2004 . Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. 249 533 545 1986 US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta and WO 2004 056312 A1 Adams et al. especially at Example 11 and knockout cell lines such as alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase gene FUT8 knock out CHO cells Yamane Ohnuki et al. supra .

In fact the antibody 2C8.vX was afucosylated to produce an antibody called anti LTa 2C8.vX AF. This molecule was generated using a stable CHO cell line having a FUT8 knock out gene as described by the method in Yamane Ohnuki et al. supra It is 100 afucosylated.

The biophysical properties of 2C8.vX including blocking and binding data were not substantially changed upon afucosylation thereof except for the ADCC. The ADCC properties of the wild type and afucosylated molecules were determined by carrying out the experiments using the protocol set forth in Example 16 involving 293 LT 1 2 cells. The results are shown in . The figure shows that the afucosylated antibody anti LT 2C8.vX AF has about a ten fold increase over the wild type WT antibody produced in a normal CHO cell line as described above .

As an alternative way to achieve high yields of non fucosylated antibodies in mammalian cells an RNAi approach may be employed to knock down the expression of the FUT8 gene. A plasmid may be used to produce short hairpin siRNA consisting of 19 nt nucleotide sense siRNA sequence specific to the gene of FUT8 linked to its reverse complementary antisense siRNA sequence by a short spacer 9nt hairpin loop followed by 5 6 U s at the 3 end.

Four different RNAi probes are designed to target the different regions based on the available CHO FUT8 DNA sequence.

For testing the efficacy of these RNAi probes a FLAG tagged FUT8 fusion protein is constructed using the available CHO FUT8 DNA sequence Genbank accession no. P AAC63891 . RT PCR is performed with FUT8 primers and the resulting PCR fragment fused with 5 FLAG tag sequence. The tagged FUT8 fragment is cloned into an expression vector. The RNAi probe plasmid and flag tagged FUT8 plasmid are cotransfected into CHO cells. Cell lysate is extracted 24 hours after transfection and the FUT8 fusion protein level analyzed using anti flag M2 antibody by immuno blotting. In the presence of RNAi probes the fusion protein expression is expected to be significantly inhibited in most of the cases.

The two probes showing the best inhibitory effect are transfected into a CHO cell line expressing an antibody as described herein such as 2C8.vX. The expressed anti LT alpha antibody is purified by a protein A column and submitted for Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of flight MALDI TOF mass spectral analysis of asparagine linked oligosaccharides including fucose content and Fc R binding assay as described below.

Methods for analyzing the oligosaccharides by MALDI TOF are conducted generally as follows N linked oligosaccharides are released from recombinant glycoproteins using the peptide N glycosidase F PNGase F procedure of Papac et al. 8 445 454 1998 . Briefly the wells of a 96 well polyvinylidene difluoride PVDF lined microtitre plate Millipore Bedford Mass. are conditioned with 100 l methanol that is drawn through the PVDF membranes by applying vacuum to the MILLIPORE multiscreen vacuum manifold. The conditioned PVDF membranes are washed with 3 250 l water. Between all wash steps the wells are drained completely by applying gentle vacuum to the manifold. The membranes are washed with reduction and carboxymethylation buffer RCM consisting of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride 360 mM TRIS buffer 2 mM EDTA pH 8.6. Glycoprotein samples 50 g are applied to individual wells again drawn through the PVDF membranes by gentle vacuum and the wells washed with 2 50 l of RCM buffer. The immobilized samples are reduced by adding 50 l of a 0.1 M dithiothreitol DTT solution to each well and incubating the microtitre plate at 37 C. for 1 hr. DTT is removed by vacuum and the wells are washed 4 250 l water. Cysteine residues are carboxylmethylated by the addition of 50 l of a 0.1 M iodoacetic acid IAA solution that is freshly prepared in 1 M NaOH and diluted to 0.1 M with RCM buffer.

Carboxymethylation is accomplished by incubation for 30 min in the dark at ambient temperature. Vacuum is applied to the plate to remove the IAA solution and the wells are washed with 4 250 l purified water. The PVDF membranes are blocked by the addition of 100 l of 1 PVP360 polyvinylpyrrolidine 360 000 MW Sigma solution and incubation for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The PVP 360 solution is removed by gentle vacuum and the wells are washed 4 250 l water. Peptide N Glycosidase F PNGase F amidase New England Biolabs Beverly Mass. at 25 l of a 25 Unit ml solution in 10 mM TRIS acetate pH 8.3 is added to each well and the digest proceeds for 3 hr at 37 C. After digestion the samples are transferred to 500 l EPPENDORF tubes and 2.5 l of a 1.5 M acetic acid solution is added to each sample. The acidified samples are incubated for two hrs at ambient temperature to convert the oligosaccharides from the glycosylamine to the hydroxyl form. Prior to MALDI TOF mass spectral analysis the released oligosaccharides are desalted using a 0.7 ml bed of cation exchange resin AG50W X8 resin in the hydrogen form Bio Rad Hercules Calif. slurry packed into compact reaction tubes US Biochemical Cleveland Ohio .

For MALDI TOF mass spectral analysis of the samples in the positive mode the desalted oligosaccharides 0.5 l aliquots are applied to the stainless target with 0.5 l of the 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix sDHB that is prepared by dissolving 2 mg 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid with 0.1 mg of 5 methoxyslicylic acid in 1 ml of 1 mM NaCl in 25 aqueous ethanol. The sample matrix mixture is vacuum dried and then allowed to absorb atmospheric moisture prior to analysis. Released oligosaccharides are analyzed by MALDI TOF on a PERSEPTIVE BIOSYSTEMS VOYAGER ELITE mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer is operated in the positive mode at 20 kV with the linear configuration and utilizing delayed extraction. Data are acquired using a laser power of approximately 1100 and in the data summation mode 240 scans to improve the signal to noise ratio. The instrument is calibrated with a mixture of standard oligosaccharides and the data are smoothed using a 19 point Savitsky Golay algorithm before the masses are assigned. Integration of the mass spectral data is achieved using the CAESAR 7.2 data analysis software package SciBridge Software .

Binding of control and test materials to the human Fc receptors can be assessed using modified versions of procedures originally described by Shields et al. 276 6591 604 2001 .

For confirmation that the RNAi transfected cells do have less FUT8 RNA expression a Northern blot can be performed using RNA samples extracted from the transfected cells 24 hours after transfection. Total RNA from cells containing a control plasmid random mouse DNA sequence no homology to any known mouse proteins and two RNAi plasmids can be purified and hybridized with a 300 bp probe. The knock down of endogenous 1 6 fucosyltransferase RNA can be further confirmed by quantitative PCR.
