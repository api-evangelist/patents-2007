This application is the United States national phase of International Patent Application No. PCT US2007 069911 filed May 29 2007 which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 819 120 filed Jul 7 2006 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Particular aspects relate generally to the discovery of a novel metabolic process for converting monolignols into allyl propenyl phenols and more particularly relate to chavicol eugenol formation or production and to the discovery of a novel chavicol eugenol synthase that converts p coumaryl coniferyl alcohol esters into chavicol eugenol and further relates to novel compositions and methods e.g. novel proteins and nucleic acids encoding same and novel methods for using same for producing or forming chavicol eugenol in cell culture and or genetically modified plants and for re engineering the composition of plant biomass.

Humanity currently faces enormous political and scientific challenges in identifying and securing stable future sources of renewable energy in an environmentally acceptable and sustainable manner e.g. leading to so called biofuels bioenergy . Similar concerns and considerations also apply to the continued future supply of other key petrochemical intermediates such as monomers needed for sufficient levels of industrial polymer production e.g. polystyrenes polyethylenes etc. as well as for stable sources of key specialty chemicals e.g. flavor and fragrance chemicals which at present are produced in regions of varying political stability and which can also be subject to seasonal climatic variations such factors often result in unpredictable market prices for these commodities . This is not a new scientific problem but rather reflects one that has been difficult to solve over a period spanning more than three decades until now again brought to the forefront by the most recent biofuels bioenergy crisis. Today about 12 of all the petroleum resources are used for non fuel non energy purposes this including polymer and other specialty chemical applications.

The so called lignin problem or challenge. To date the difficulties in plant biomass utilization have centered on the recalcitrance of the various lignocellulosic matrices present in woody plants namely the so called lignin problem or challenge. Lignins are monolignol derived polymeric end products of the phenylpropanoid pathway originating from the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine . From a structural perspective the lignins Nature s second most abundant organic substances after cellulose are amorphous plant cell wall polymers that make up ca 20 30 of all plant stem biomass.More specifically vascular plant species have differing lignin contents with values ranging from 30 in conifers softwoods to lower amounts 20 25 in hardwoods such as poplar and herbaceous plant species to even smaller levels in various primitive plant species. The physiological roles of lignins are to engender structural support to the vascular apparatus thereby enabling such organisms to stand upright as well as providing conduits for water and nutrient transport and to provide physical barriers against opportunistic pathogens. Particular actual i.e. minimal lignin contents and or compositions may be needed for a particular plant to avoid any deleterious effects for growth development stem structural integrity etc. In general lignins represent a formidable technical challenge particularly due to their intractable nature for improved plant biomass utilization e.g. when considering the use of woody biomass for bioethanol production as well as for wood pulp and paper manufacture.

More specifically there are two major scientific hurdles that have not been technically overcome for the facile utilization of this and other plant renewable resources both of which involve the polymeric lignins.

The first results from their intractable nature since lignin removal has long been a limitation in the processing of wood for both pulp paper manufacture and for forage digestibility by ruminants. This is largely due to the lack of isolated enzymes and or proteins that can efficiently degrade lignin macromolecules in contrast to reports in the nineteen eighties that indicated this problem had been solved.That is nearly twenty years ago it was reported that several productive routes for lignin removal from wood had both been discovered and attained via utilization of lignin degrading enzymes in fungi bacteria and where three candidates ultimately emerged lignin peroxidase manganese peroxidase and laccase . However this lignin peroxidase or ligninase was only assayed initially with an aqueous acetone extract of spruce wood which does not actually extract the lignins from wood. Twenty years later none of these enzymes are routinely utilized in biotechnological applications for lignin removal separation and their roles in enzymatic lignin biodegradation are still in question as we had noted earlier.Today more than 50 million tons of lignin derived substances are generated annually as by products of pulp paper manufacture within the USA alone.Other possibilities now being considered are the putative true lignin depolymerases that target specific inter unit linkages in lignin macromolecules.

The second technological hurdle is that lignins cannot readily be converted into either ethanol and or other liquid gaseous fuels using currently available fermentation processes. Indeed the polymeric lignins themselves are a formidable physical barrier to an efficient fermentation of carbohydrate biomass for ethanol generation and thus their presence represents a critical problem in making these technologies more economical.

There is therefore an urgent need in the art for highly creative and sound technological solutions for renewable plant resource utilization.

There is therefore a pronounced need in the art for an approach whereby the carbon allocated towards lignification is redirected to provide for inherently more useful and or more easily tractable materials and to facilitate the generation of for example biofuels from the remaining plant biomass.

Aspects of the present invention provide highly creative and sound technological solutions for renewable plant resource utilization. Particular aspects provide a novel approach whereby the carbon allocated towards lignification is redirected to provide for inherently more useful and or more easily tractable materials and to facilitate the generation of for example biofuels from the remaining plant biomass. Particular aspects provide a novel methods for generation in planta of liquid combustible allyl propenyl phenols such as eugenol and chavicol. In additional aspects these phenolic products are utilized for non ethanol biofuel bioenergy purposes while the remaining plant biomass facilitates the generation of for example other biofuels.

Particular aspects of the present invention relate generally to the discovery of a novel metabolic process for converting monolignols into allyl propenyl phenols and more particularly relate to chavicol eugenol formation or production in cell culture and or genetically modified plants.

Certain aspects provide novel chavicol eugenol synthase proteins that convert monolignols such as p coumaryl coniferyl alcohol esters into allyl propenyl phenols such as chavicol eugenol.

Additional aspects provide novel nucleic acids e.g. genes cDNAs RNA encoding the novel chavicol eugenol synthase proteins.

Yet additional aspects provide genetically modified cultured cells e.g. plant cells and plants comprising one or more nucleic acids e.g. genes cDNAs RNA encoding the novel chavicol eugenol synthase proteins.

Further aspects provide novel methods using the chavicol eugenol synthase proteins and or the encoding nucleic acids and for producing or forming chavicol eugenol or increasing the amount thereof in cell culture and or in genetically modified plants.

Yet further aspects provide novel methods using the chavicol eugenol synthase proteins and or the encoding nucleic acids for re engineering the biomass composition of genetically engineered cells and plants.

Additional aspects provide novel methods using the chavicol eugenol synthase proteins and or the encoding nucleic acids for improved plant biomass utilization e.g. in view of biomass utilization for bioethanol production as well as for wood pulp and paper manufacture etc. by re engineering the biomass composition of genetically engineered cells and plants.

Additional aspects provide novel methods using the chavicol eugenol synthase proteins and or the encoding nucleic acids for re engineering the amount and or composition of lignins of genetically engineered cells and plants. In preferred embodiments the amount of lignins is reduced relative to wild type WT normal cell or plant counterparts .

Further aspects provide novel methods using the chavicol eugenol synthase proteins and or the encoding nucleic acids for altering re engineering the dynamic modulus of genetically engineered cells and or plants relative to WT by re engineering the amount and or composition of lignins of the cells and or plants. In preferred embodiments the dynamic modulus is reduced with reduction in the amount of lignins in the cells and or plants.

Yet further aspects provide novel methods using the chavicol eugenol synthase proteins and or the encoding nucleic acids for altering re engineering the formation of reaction tissue of genetically engineered cells and or plants relative to WT by re engineering the amount and or composition of lignins of the cells and or plants. In preferred embodiments the amount and or composition of reaction tissue is increased and or altered with reduction in the amount of lignins in the cells and or plants.

Additional aspects provide novel methods using the chavicol eugenol synthase proteins and or the encoding nucleic acids for altering re engineering the antimicrobial analgesic plant defense properties of genetically engineered cells and or plants relative to WT by re engineering the amount and or composition of lignins of the cells and or plants. In preferred embodiments the amount and or composition of antimicrobial analgesic plant defense properties is increased and or altered with reduction in the amount of lignins in the cells and or plants.

Yet additional aspects provide novel methods using the chavicol eugenol synthase proteins and or the encoding nucleic acids for altering re engineering the flavor fragrance properties of genetically engineered cells and or plants relative to WT by re engineering the amount and or composition of lignins of the cells and or plants. In preferred embodiments the amount and or composition of flavor fragrance properties is increased and or altered or decreased with reduction in the amount of lignins in the cells and or plants.

Yet additional aspects provide novel methods of using the genetically engineered cells and or plants comprising the inventive chavicol eugenol synthase proteins and or the inventive encoding nucleic acids for production of chavicol eugenol for use in making antibacterials plant defense analgesics polymer building blocks and in biofuel bioenergy production.

Accordingly novel compositions methods and sources of chavicol and or eugenol are provided and the compositions and compounds so produced have novel properties. Particular aspects provide novel and facile methods for redirecting carbon flow in plants from e.g. lignin synthesis to the synthesis of liquid highly combustible monomers for potential application as either flavoring agents biofuels bioenergy and or building blocks for polymer applications e.g. based on styrene chemistry .

Particular aspects of the present invention relate to new developments in the enzymology and molecular biology of plant phenylpropanoids and therefore offer numerous opportunities to re engineer the composition and or properties of plant biomass. According to particular aspects two main targets of such modifications are the optimized production of valuable compounds and reductions in the levels of less desirable products e.g. the structural biopolymeric lignins . In particular aspects for example the amounts of lignin biopolymers in woody species are reduced with carbon flow concurrently redirected towards production of related non polymeric phenylpropanoids such as the more valuable allyl propenyl phenols e.g. eugenol chavicol .

As described above lignins are monolignol derived polymeric end products of the phenylpropanoid pathway originating from the amino acids phenylalanine 1 and tyrosine 2 and represent a formidable technical challenge particularly due to their intractable nature for improved plant biomass utilization e.g. when considering the use of woody biomass for bioethanol production as well as for wood pulp and paper manufacture. Other species specific outcomes of the phenylpropanoid pathway however include metabolites such as lignans flavonoids and allyl propenyl phenols.

According to preferred aspects of the present invention applicants discovery of the biochemical pathway resulting in the production of the more valuable liquid allyl propenyl phenols e.g. eugenol 33 chavicol 31 methylchavicol 32 and anethole 38 which are for example important components of plant spice aromas and flavors provide a substantially useful approach and method to re engineer cell and plant metabolism in new directions. According to particular aspects these compounds are synthesized from monolignols in two consecutive enzymatic reactions i acylation of the terminal C 9 oxygen of the monolignol forming an ester and ii regiospecific NAD P H dependent reduction of the phenylpropanoid side chain with displacement of the carboxylate ester as leaving group. According to additional aspects the proteins involved in the latter step are homologous to well characterized phenylpropanoid reductases pinoresinol lariciresinol isoflavone phenylcoumaran benzylic ether and leucoanthocyanidin reductases with similar catalytic mechanisms being operative. In preferred aspects the proteins and corresponding genes involved in these transformations have been isolated and characterized and provide methods of re engineering plants to redirect e.g. partially redirect carbon flow from lignin or lignans into these liquid volatile compounds in oilseeds leafy or heartwood forming tissues or woody stems.

In further aspects the proteins and or corresponding genes involved in these transformations provide methods of re engineering plants to facilitate wood processing in pulp paper industries and offer sources of renewable plant derived biofuels intermediate chemicals in polymer industries or specialty chemicals in perfume and flavor industries.

Example 1 herein discloses novel chavicol eugenol synthases that were isolated from . The creosote bush accumulates a complex mixture of 8 8 regiospecifically linked lignans of which the potent antioxidant nordihydroguaiaretic acid NDGA 40 is the most abundant. Its tetra O methyl derivative M4N 41 is showing considerable promise in the treatment of the refractory hard to treat cancers of the head and neck. NDGA 40 and related 9 9 deoxygenated lignans are thought to be formed by dimerization of allyl propenyl phenols phenylpropanoid compounds that lack C 9 oxygenation thus differentiating them from the more common monolignol derived lignans. In applicants ongoing studies dedicated towards elucidating the biochemical pathway to NDGA 40 and its congeners six pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase homologues PLRh nucleic acid SEQ ID NOS 1 3 5 17 19 and 21 and polypeptide SEQ ID NOS 2 4 6 18 20 and 22 respectively were isolated from with protein obtained in recombinant form. According to aspects of the present invention all three of these enzymes catalyze the conversion of p coumaryl 48 50 and coniferyl alcohol 49 esters into the corresponding allylphenols chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 . Of these three PLRh Lt proteins one of these homolouges PLRh Lt1 nucleic acid SEQ ID NO 1 polypeptide SEQ ID NO 2 was analyzed in greatest detail and this protein efficiently catalyzes the conversion of p coumaryl 48 50 and coniferyl 49 alcohol esters into the corresponding allylphenols chavicol 31 and eugenol b and neither of their propenylphenol regioisomers p anol 37 and isoeugenol 39 are formed during this enzyme reaction.

Example 2 herein discloses data relating to reaction tissue formation in alfalfa L. Fabaceae wild type and p coumarate 3 hydroxylase down regulated lines and their stem tensile modulus properties. The discovery of reaction tissue in the forage crop alfalfa L. is described which to applicants knowledge has not hitherto been established as occurring in herbaceous perennials. It was first observed during an investigation of a transgenic alfalfa line reduced in overall lignin content but was also formed in the wild type line as well. The transgenic alfalfa line obtained through standard down regulation of the gene encoding p coumarate 3 hydroxylase pC3H was reduced in lignin content by circa 64 as expected from our previous metabolic flux analyses Anterola et al. 2002 . Comparison of the pC3H down regulated pC3H I and WT lines established several differences however when employing microscopy analyses and biomechanical testing of various internodal alfalfa branch sections. Relative to WT the pC3H I line a apparently more rapidly formed reaction tissue containing gelatinous fibers with adjacent thick walled fibers presumed to be intermediate tissue during development and in greater amount b had an increased volume of xylem tissue and c had comparable tensile dynamic modulus properties. These findings thus establish the limited ability of this perennial angiosperm to form inducible reaction tissue in a manner somewhat analogous to that of woody arborescent angiosperms. Finally with the recent rapidly growing interest in lignocellulosic materials for biofuels e.g. bioethanol the potential of effectuating reductions in lignin amounts in woody angiosperms with increased formation of reaction tension wood tissue is discussed. This is because the latter tissues are often viewed as a deleterious trait for many agronomic forestry applications e.g. due to the difficulties experienced in their subsequent processing for many industrial commercial applications.

Thus in Example 2 applicants disclose that formation of reaction tension tissue occurs in wild type WT alfalfa designated WT C 1 and whose amounts have also apparently increased in the pC3H down regulated line e.g. pC3H I as did the overall xylem volume. Yet in spite of the greatly reduced lignin content 64 there were apparently no significant differences between both lines in terms of material strength properties i.e. as shown by tensile dynamic modulus testing of young developing alfalfa branches. It is thus proposed that formation of reaction tissue may be increased in alfalfa and other angiosperms when the overall vasculature is weakened through reducing lignin content s . This can then serve as a compensatory mechanism in order to attempt to maintain needed biophysical biomechanical properties of the overall vasculature which would otherwise be weakened.

Example 3 herein discloses particular exemplary applications of Applicants inventive compositions and methods to provide chavicol eugenol for biofuels intermediate chemicals . The Example relates to advances made by Applicants and which result in formation of two well known molecules chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 . Both substances have historically been used as flavor fragrance components from Tanzania Madagascar and Indonesia however the biochemical biotechnological manipulations disclosed herein provide for the diversion of monolignols from lignin lignan formation in plant species to instead diverting these compounds for use for example in biodiesel or polymer production plastic replacement i.e. in addition to their current roles in human nutrition and medicine. The present inventive methods could be applied for example either in oilseed bearing plants e.g. canola or in heartwood forming tissues of trees e.g. western red cedar used for lumber and pulp paper products. In the latter heartwood formation is generally accompanied by a massive deposition of non structural low molecular weight molecules such as the lignan plicatic acid which in western red cedar can be 20 of the overall dry weight of the stem. These processes oilseed and heartwood formation deposition of metabolites as well as judicial modification of lignin content and composition thus offer the potential to rationally optimize plant feedstocks for biofuel bioenergy either directly in specific crops or indirectly as part of wood processing for pulp paper specialty chemicals etc.

Presently a new pathway utilizing monolignols has been discovered which applicants consider has extraordinarily promising potential for either biofuels intermediate chemicals or as an improved and stable source of the spice chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 components. For example eugenol 33 is widely used in medical and dental applications due to its biocidal and analgesic properties. In the pathway to these two allylphenols the monolignol precursors are first biochemically activated via ester formation and then subsequently converted into the highly combustible liquid fuels the aromatic hydrocarbons chavicol and eugenol . Importantly the protein involved chavicol eugenol synthase CS ES is a homologue of Applicants PLR PCBER proteins whose encoding cDNA hybridizes under the same conditions as for PLR. According to particular aspects of the present invention this discovery provides novel methods for diverting monolignol flow away from lignin biopolymer formation or from heartwood lignan accumulation deposition to that engendering formation of the potential product liquid fuels intermediate chemicals of interest. In additional aspects this strategy enhances oilseed production as well both in relative amounts of bioproduct biofuels and their calorific value. In further aspects these products chavicol eugenol would be removed leaving the remaining lignin reduced biomass able to be more efficiently fermented for ethanol production.

Preferably two genes encoding respective proteins are used to provide proteins that can i acylate monolignol precursors to afford the corresponding acylated derivatives e.g. the acylating transferase family from Chau et al. 430 237 246 2004. and ii convert the latter into liquid biofuel intermediate chemicals e.g. using the presently disclosed CS ES . Alternatively the monolignols can be chemically acylated followed by conversion by CS ES.

Example 4 herein discloses that plant cell walls are enfeebled when attempting to preserve native lignin configuration with poly p hydroxycinnamaldehydes evolutionary implications. This Example relates to the effects of disruption of lignin macromolecular configuration and stem vascular integrity through CAD mutations. With such mutations template polymerization was attempted but aborted at an early stage of cell wall phenolic deposition when p hydroxycinnamaldehydes were employed as substrates. More specifically the lignin deficient double mutant of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase CAD cad 4 cad S or cad c cad d in Sibout et al. 2005 was comprehensively examined for effects on disruption of native lignin macromolecular configuration the two genes encode the catalytically most active CAD s for monolignol lignin formation Kim et al. 2004 101 1455 1460 . The inflorescence stems of the double mutant presented a prostrate phenotype with dynamic modulus properties greatly reduced relative to that of the wild type WT line due to severe reductions in macromolecular lignin content. Interestingly initially the overall pattern of phenolic deposition in the mutant was apparently very similar to WT indicative of comparable assembly processes attempting to be duplicated. However shortly into the stage involving monomer cleavable 8 O 4 linkage formation deposition was aborted. At this final stage the double mutant had retained a very limited ability to biosynthesize monolignols as evidenced by cleavage and release of ca 4 of the monolignol derived moieties relative to the lignin of the WT line. In addition while small amounts of cleavable p hydroxycinnamaldehyde derived moieties were released the overall frequency of monomer cleavable 8 O 4 inter unit linkages closely approximated that of WT for the equivalent level of lignin deposition in spite of the differences in monomer composition. Additionally 8 5 linked inter unit structures were clearly evident albeit as fully aromatized phenylcoumaran like substructures. The data are interpreted as a small amount of p hydroxycinnamaldehydes being utilized in highly restricted attempts to preserve native lignin configuration i.e. through very limited monomer degeneracy during template polymerization which would otherwise afford lignins proper in the cell wall from their precursor monolignols. The defects introduced e.g. in the vascular integrity provide important insight as to why p hydroxycinnamaldehydes never evolved as lignin precursors in the 350 000 or so extant vascular plant species. Prior to investigating lignin primary structure proper it is instructive to initially define the fundamental characteristics of the biopolymer s being formed such as inter unit frequency and lignin content in order to design approaches to determine overall sequences of linkages.

Outcomes of the phenylpropanoid CC pathway include not only the lignins in woody non woody vascular plants but also to varying extents lignans flavonoids coumarins anthocyanins as well as allyl and propenyl phenols in different species.

Biosynthesis of monolignols. The phenylpropanoid pathway entry point is generally considered to be the amino acid phenylalanine 1 Phe through action of phenylalanine ammonia lyase PAL EC 4.3.1.5 forming trans cinnamic acid 3 . Although initially regarded as a rate determining reaction in the pathway PAL does not seem to serve as a major carbon allocation regulator with flux apparently being determined by the availability of Phe 1 and by downstream enzymes in the pathway especially C4H C3H.

According to particular aspects of the present invention there are compelling reasons to identify novel ways to more effectively either utilize the lignin biopolymers or to manipulate the amounts or forms of carbon allocated to the lignin forming pathway e.g. to produce more desirable bioproducts in commercially cultivated plant species. Indeed a number of biotechnological manipulations of both lignin contents and compositions in various plant species have already been carried out i.e. various transgenic mutant lines have been successfully obtained using standard transformation procedures see Anterola Lewis Trends in lignin modification A comprehensive analysis of the effects of genetic manipulations mutations on lignification and vascular integrity 61 221 294 2002 for examples and references therein . Generally the effects of drastically reducing lignin contents in both woody and non woody vascular plants result in a significant impairment weakening of the vascular apparatus e.g. collapsed vessels etc. Such defects potentially lead to severe drawbacks in growing biotechnologically modified plant lines commercially as this can lead to for example premature lodging weakening of plant stems dwarfing etc. during growth development. These examples underscore the importance of the extent to which lignin compositions contents are manipulated and illustrate the importance of particular novel methods disclosed herein for providing partial reduction in lignin levels to avoid introducing structural defects prohibiting field applications of the resulting plant cultivars in for example bioethanol biofuel bioproduct generation. According to additional aspects the inventive compositions and methods provide for partial reduction in lignin levels to avoid a weakened vascular apparatus that may result in plants more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. Therefore according to preferred aspects a judicious balance is maintained in growing vascular plants for commercial purposes and in reducing modifying lignin contents compositions. According to particular aspects of the present invention using the inventive compositions and methods described herein lignin contents are partially reduced to preclude or at least lessen the extent of drawbacks associated with drastically reducing lignin contents.

According to additional aspects there are novel and alternative biotechnological opportunities to produce renewable energy biofuels and specialty bioproducts. That is there are other metabolic outcomes of the phenylpropanoid pathway from its entry point phenylalanine 1 depending upon the species that can include for example differential formation of coumarins lignans and flavonoids as well as allyl propenyl phenols see . In particular allylphenols and propenylphenols which differ in the position of their side chain double bonds include the high value liquids eugenol 33 methyl chavicol 32 and anethole 38 . These natural products account for much of the aroma present in specialty essential oils of various plant species such as cloves tarragon and anise respectively and are thought to be produced in planta mainly for defense against insects and parasites as well as for attraction of pollinators. In addition most of these compounds are liquid at room temperature and their relatively low degree of oxygenation grants them with high heats of combustion. According to particular aspects these are more desirable characteristics when considering their possible utilization as fuels. Notably lignins and most lignans as well as the allyl propenyl phenols are all derived from the same monolignol precursors thus as disclosed herein an approach whereby the latter are differentially utilized could impact the production accumulation of these diverse classes of compounds.

Therefore according to particular aspects of the present invention biotechnological manipulations of this pathway are not only be directed towards simply reducing lignin levels but also to retarget carbon towards related metabolic pathways e.g. through redirection of metabolic carbon flux to the production of related phenolic compounds in the main repositories for plant organic carbon storage. The latter could include either oilseed bearing structures e.g. flax seed or heartwood forming tissues of trees e.g. western red cedar . It is these repositories that are largely used as plant renewable resources whether as sources of vegetable oils or for lumber pulp paper products. In addition to the structural lignins heartwood formation is often accompanied by massive deposition of non structural low molecular weight molecules such as the monolignol derived lignan plicatic acid 30 see for structure and its congeners in western red cedar whose amounts can be 20 of the overall dry weight. In particular embodiments rational optimization modification of plant biomass is accomplished directly for either biofuel bioenergy bioproduct generation in specific crops or indirectly as part of heart wood processing for pulp paper specialty chemicals etc.

For example recent studies VASS O et al. 4 2733 2744 2006 and KOEDUKA et al. 103 10128 10133 2006. have described the formation of some quite well known phenylpropanoid pathway monomeric metabolites namely the liquid allyl propenyl phenols chavicol 31 eugenol 33 and their analogues 32 34 39 . Historically such allyl propenyl phenols have commonly been used throughout the world mainly as flavor fragrance components present in spices especially cloves with those being largely imported from Tanzania Madagascar and Indonesia. Such material sources are imported simply because it is in those countries where the plant species accumulating these more unusual metabolites are cultivated. According to particular aspects these biochemical biotechnological processes provide a method of diversion of monolignols from either lignin and or lignan formation in more commonly utilized woody non woody plant species of for example North America to afford instead the liquid allyl propenyl phenol monomers.

According to particular aspects besides lignin specialized plant metabolism can utilize monolignols in the formation of lignans phenylpropanoid dimers as well as allyl and propenyl phenols. Allylphenols differ from propenylphenols in their side chain double bond position with the former having terminal C 8 C 9 desaturation and the latter having the chemically more stable internal C 7 C 8 double bond. Several biochemical hypotheses had been created in the art to explain their distinctive lack of a C 9 oxygenated functionality but experimental support for any was lacking.

The present applicants interest in the allyl propenyl phenols first began with studies directed to elucidating the biochemical pathway s to the lignan nor dihydroguaiaretic acid 40 NDGA and its congeners these being abundant metabolites in the creosote bush . These lignans however lack oxygenated carbon 9 9 functionalities that are present in most lignan classes e.g. podophyllotoxin 41 secoisolariciresinol 42 as well as in the polymeric lignins and monomeric phenylpropanoids e.g. monolignols 19 23 in the vast majority of plant species. Based on previous radiolabeling stable isotope labeling studies it was presumed that the unusual loss of the oxygenated functionality occurred at the monomer stage i.e. allyl and or propenyl phenols could be serving as the precursors substrates for dimerization to form these less common lignans. In this regard the biosynthetic pathways to the allyl propenyl phenols had not been elucidated in any organism and in particular the precise precursor substrate undergoing deoxygenation represented both a long standing question and a biochemical mystery Anonica et al. 1108 1109 1971 Klischies et al. 479 880 1975 Manitto et al. 1 1974 1727 1731 Manitto et al. 15 1567 1568 1974 and Senanayake et al. 16 2032 2033 1977 .

Basil Thai variety was selected by the present Applicants as a suitable study system since it accumulates the simplest allylphenol methylchavicol 32 based on various radiolabeling studies it was shown that the latter was derived from the corresponding monolignol p coumaryl alcohol 19 VASS O et al. 4 2733 2744 2006 . Three potential mechanisms for the conversion of 19 into 32 included either reduction of the monolignol side chain i.e. saturation followed by dehydration methylation of the phenolic moiety preceding further side chain modification and or activation of the terminal C 9 oxygenated functionality prior to side chain double bond reduction . Pathways A and C were eliminated since no experimental evidence in support of either route was obtained.

Interestingly however a double bond reductase was discovered and characterized which utilized p coumaryl aldehyde 14 as the preferred substrate to afford the corresponding side chain reduced aldehyde 45 Kasahara et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 703 229. Filed Mar. 27 2001. Issued Mar. 9 2004 Kasahara et al. 2006 67 1765 1780 Youn et al. 281 40076 40088 2006 . This alkenal reductase activity was the first to be reported in the phenylpropanoid pathway with the corresponding enzymes isolated from AtDBR and PtPPDBR also being homologous to a terpenoid double bond reductase pulegone reductase PulR from and mammalian alkenal reductases as well. AtDBR and PtPPDBR catalyze the NADPH dependent reduction of p coumaryl 14 and coniferyl 16 aldehydes to the corresponding dihydroaldehydes and AtDBR has also been shown to catalyze the reduction of 4 hydroxynonenal 4 HNE a pro apoptotic lipid peroxidation product to 4 hydroxynonanal Kasahara et al. 2006 67 1765 1780 Youn et al. 281 40076 40088 2006 . Based on substrate versatility studies and a X ray crystal structure for AtDBR a concerted mechanism involving an enol intermediate was proposed for these zinc independent alkenal reductases Youn et al. 281 40076 40088 2006 . While the corresponding dihydroalcohol product 46 is a well known plant defense metabolite it was not however converted in basil into either chavicol 31 and or p anol 37 VASS O et al. 4 2733 2744 2006 . Accordingly it was not considered as being involved in allyl propenyl phenol biosynthesis.

Rather according to aspects of the present invention a quite novel metabolic process converting monolignols such as p coumaryl 19 and coniferyl 21 alcohols into allyl propenyl phenols chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 respectively was discovered with two enzymes being implicated in their formation in planta. The first step is activation of the monolignol side chain alcohol by conjugation to an activated acid acyl CoA resulting in formation of a monolignol ester. This modification results in energetic terms in formation of a more facile leaving group carboxylate ester which is more readily displaced by an incoming reducing hydride e.g. in the form of NAD P H. Indeed such coniferyl alcohol acyl transferases have been recently characterized in basil Harrison Gang 192006 and Dexter et al. 49 265 275 2007 utilizing acetyl CoA and coniferyl alcohol 21 to afford coniferyl acetate 49 and according to present aspects it is reasonable to expect that substrate versatile acyltransferases will be able to utilize different monolignols and acyl aroyl CoA cofactors to generate different esters. One such ester p coumaryl coumarate 50 had been previously shown to serve as substrate for enzyme preparations from Suzuki et al. 1088 1089 2002 and Suzuki et al. 2838 2839 2004 generating the nor lignans Z and E hinokiresinol 52 53 respectively. Although the proteins responsible for the latter conversions remain to be fully characterized and or described potential mechanisms whereby the departing carboxylate as CO facilitates formation of the final C8 C7 bond without any additional cofactors can be envisaged . It is also possible to propose potential mechanisms where p coumaryl coumarate 50 or other p coumaryl alcohol esters e.g. p coumaryl acetate 48 generates through the addition of an incoming hydride chavicol 31 and or its regioisomer p anol 37 .

Indeed according to aspects of the present invention the second step in monolignol reduction was shown to be the action of regiospecific reductases that transfer a hydride from NADH or NADPH into either the C 7 or C 9 of the corresponding monolignol ester or a quinone methide derivative thereof thus forming either an allyl or propenyl phenol respectively B . These regiospecific reductases e.g. chavicol and eugenol synthase CS ES and isoeugenol synthase IES have been studied to a larger extent than the monolignol specific acyltransferases. Computational analyses of CS ES isolated from basil and IES from indicate greatest homology 40 45 identity Koeduka et al. 103 10128 10133 2006 to members of the PIP family of reductases we have either discovered and or extensively characterized pinoresinol lariciresinol isoflavone and phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductases Fujita et al. 274 618 627 1999 Dinkova Kostova et al 271 29473 29482 1996 Gang et al. 274 7516 7527 1999 and for which crystal structures have been determined Min et al. 278 50714 50723 2003 .

According to particular aspects of the present invention six such PLR CS ES homologues from LtPLRh1 LtCES1 LtPLRh2 LtCES2 Lt PLR13 LtCES3 LtCES4 LtCES5 and LtCES6 were isolated based on sequence homology and characterized nucleic acid SEQ ID NOS 1 3 5 19 19 and 21 and protein SEQ ID NOS 2 4 and 6 18 20 and 22 respectively .

While PLR s are involved in formation of other medicinally important plant metabolites e.g. podophyllotoxin 42 and secoisolariciresinol 43 and various plant defense compounds e.g. plicatic acid 30 in western red cedar heartwood the biochemical mechanisms of PLR PCBER and CS ES share common properties including a a presumed necessity for a free phenolic functionality in the substrate indicative of a common quinone methide intermediate and b a highly conserved Lys residue K138 in PLR from K133 in its homologue in K132 in CS ES from basil required for catalysis. depicts the X ray crystal structure of one member of this class of reductases PLR from Min et al. 278 50714 50723 2003 . Based on the proposed catalytic mechanisms of CS ES and PLR applicants appreciated that a high level of similarity would be observed between these proteins. All of the PIP reductases as well as CS ES utilize NAD P H as the source of a hydride which is regiospecifically or stereospecifically added to a carbon originated from a phenylpropanoid side chain i.e. either a monolignol derivative or dimer . In fact a brief phylogenetic analysis indicates that these homologues cluster together with PLR e.g. from PCBER e.g. from IFR e.g. from and leucoanthocyanidin reductases LACR e.g. from with the homologue clustering closer to more distant PCBER and IFR homologues .

The biochemical characteristics of these enzymes have been studied with basil CS ES and IES reported to have substrate affinities K coniferyl acetate 49 of 1.6 5.1 mM and Vof 7 20 pkat gprotein. These are indicative of relatively low substrate affinity although not far from the range of other enzymes involved in volatile oil biosynthesis. Additionally the corresponding PLR homologue in the creosote bush catalyzes similar conversions but interestingly with even higher catalytic efficacy Kvalues of a few hundred M and Vvalues of a few hundred pkat gprotein for coniferyl acetate 49 p coumaryl acetate 48 and p coumaryl coumarate 50 see Table 1 . According to additional aspects with respect to the properties of other PIP reductases regarding their abilities to form allyl and propenyl phenols it is reasonable to expect substrate versatility in PLR s acting on monolignol esters .

According to particular aspects the long standing question regarding the biochemical formation of these widely used compounds allyl and propenyl phenols has now been elucidated and shown to utilize the same pathway precursors as lignin biosynthesis. Proteins and their corresponding genes involved in this process have been isolated and characterized thus providing a novel approach alter and re engineer the lignification program of woody plants as well as enabling the production of these compounds in more commonly cultivated plants.

In particular aspects the biotechnological approaches utilizing the enzymatic machinery described above are applied to produce allyl and propenyl phenols diverting to a pre determined extent some of the carbon flow for example from lignin towards these metabolites while maintaining the resulting plants capacities to grow and function within acceptable boundaries. The resulting cellulosic biomass thus becomes more amenable to pulp paper manufacture and or biofuel production due to the lower lignin contents. Alternatively oilseed metabolism is manipulated to produce these allyl propenyl phenol substances in larger amounts. In additional aspects upon processing and purification these compounds are used as biofuels biofuel precursors flavors fragrances and or intermediate chemicals e.g. as monomers for synthetic polymers etc. .

In additional aspects the ability to routinely biotechnologically modify plants and or cell cultures to produce allyl propenyl phenols such as chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 provides the opportunity to consider much larger markets for these products i.e. in addition to expanding the flavor fragrance antiseptic biocidal markets that currently exist. For instance in terms of the flavor fragrance market the natural vanillin market can potentially be expanded. Driven by consumer preferences towards truly natural food products food additives and pharmaceuticals several biocatalytic processes for production of plant derived metabolites using microbes and plant cell cultures have been developed and patented in recent years Krings et al. 1998 49 1 8 Longo et al 2006 44 335 353 Priefert et al. 2001 56 296 314 Rabenhorst et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 017 388 May 21 1991 1991 pp. 3 Schrader et al. 2004 26 463 472 Shimoni et al. 2000 78 1 9 Yoshimoto et al. Japan Patent number JP02200192 1990 and Berger et al. Genetic engineering. Part III Food Flavors in Encyclopedia of Food Science and Technology vol. 2 Y. H. Hui ed. Wiley Interscience New York. 1991 pp. 1313 1320 all incorporated by reference herein . This enthusiasm has been fueled by the promise to generate transgenic cultures with increased efficacy for production of target metabolites. This approach also a offers economic advantages over conventional chemical syntheses including better stereospecificity in product formation and lower amounts of waste products being generated upon processing. In particular production of flavors via biotechnological processes offers an additional economic advantage since unlike their chemically prepared counterparts the resulting products can be marketed as natural under current U.S. and E.U. legislation. In this regard successful microbial production of vanillin from various precursors such as eugenol 33 and isoeugenol 39 has been reported recently being achieved at relatively high substrate concentrations e.g. transformation of isoeugenol 20 g L using a strain of Serratia marcescens led to vanillin accumulation 3.8 g L . An enzymatic process for conversion of isoeugenol 39 into vanillin using a ligno stilbene dioxygenase from a strain has also been patented. Thus the technologies are now in hand to permit formation of natural vanillin through established microbial and genetic manipulations in either plants and or plant bacterial cell cultures.

According to additional aspects much larger anticipated potential markets for the allyl propenyl phenols include the industrial polymers and biofuel biodiesel. Regarding polymer applications the expected worldwide production of polystyrenes alone was 25 million metric tons in 2006 representing sales of 31 billion dollars. Allyl propenyl phenols can be converted into functionalized polystyrene derivatives and an increased supply creates the potential for their massive usage as intermediate monomer chemicals in industrial polymers. Currently existing applications include eugenol 33 based polymers which are widely used in dentistry in zinc oxide impression pastes applied as surgical dressings and temporary cements as well as specialty modifying i.e. coating agents in analytical electrodes.

The functionalized methylstyrenes anethole 38 and isoeugenol 39 can be converted into polymers of several thousand Da. However the potential of such conversions has only been studied to a limited extent relative to their vinyl analogues i.e. styrene and derivatives thereof in part due to limited supply availability and because propenylbenzenes do not apparently undergo as efficient free radical polymerization reactions as styrenes even though their electronic configuration is such that a radical intermediate can also be stabilized by the aromatic ring. The most efficient polymerization initiators described thus far for propenylbenzene derivatives are Lewis acids particularly AlCl SnCland BF.

In general the steric factors on the monomers define to a large extent both polymerization rates and molecular weights of the resulting polymers with anethole for example being more reactive than isoeugenol. Polymerization reactions can proceed through a conventional 1 2 chain formation similar to styrene with the propagating species being a Lewis acid induced carbocation that is added to the double bond of another monomer. This results in a polymer backbone composed of the carbons 7 and 8 of the original monomers. The molecular weights of the resulting polymers are higher at lower temperatures and in the case of anethole when polymerized by SnCl can vary from a few thousand up to about 75 000 Da depending on both temperature and dilution levels. For isoeugenol the phenolic oxygen moiety also participates in the polymerization reactions thereby increasing the structural complexity of the resulting polymer s so formed . Additionally allylphenols such as methylchavicol 32 and eugenol 33 can form mixed polymers resulting from the partial rearrangement of the side chain double bond upon carbocation formation prior to attachment to the polymer chain .

In further aspects in terms of uses to provide biofuels it is noteworthy that 100 billion gallons of gasoline fuel were consumed in the USA in 2005. In addition the annual consumption of diesel fuel in 2000 including highway diesel farms electric power railroad fuel oil residential commercial and heating and kerosene totaled approximately 57.1 billion gallons.

In yet further aspects if one considers the annual pulp and paper production in the USA ca 120 million metric tons year 1997 figures some part of the production of lignins heartwood lignans and other phenylpropanoid derivatives in commercially important woody plant species is diverted away from their natural biosynthetic pathways i.e. to afford allyl propenyl phenols etc. In principle the lignin lignan substances currently produced annually as by products of pulp paper industries more than 50 million tons could instead be converted to ca 15 billion gallons allyl propenyl phenols per annum if fully converted. Nevertheless any reduction in carbon flow to lignin or reductions changes in heartwood forming constituents could represent a significant increase in biofuel production.

In additional aspects allyl and propenyl phenols have relatively high heats of combustion at room temperature with values generally being about 70 per weight of medium chain hydrocarbons such as octane and decane. That is these allyl propenyl phenols can generate more energy per weight than ethanol. In terms of other relevant properties using two examples only for illustrative purposes chavicol 31 has boiling flash points of 238 102 C. at normal atmospheric pressure and density 1.01 g cm whereas eugenol 33 values are 253 112 C. and 1.07 g cm at 20 C. . Such values are within the ranges needed for biodiesel biofuel considerations. Their reported freezing points are however generally between 10 C. and room temperature which would reduce their potential as liquid biofuels if used exclusively as such in pure liquid form. This limitation might be circumvented however by either blending them into other fuels similar to the coconut oils added as biofuels to diesel in the Philippines or through their chemical derivatization to generate materials of lower freezing point prior to biofuel use e.g. hydrogenation which may also help reduce pollutant emission upon combustion . Catalytic hydrogenation of side chain double bonds of allyl propenylbenzenes is readily achieved at atmospheric pressures whereas reduction of the aromatic ring typically requires higher temperatures and pressures using traditional metal catalysts e.g. supported Pd or Raney Ni . Reduced allyl propenyl phenols have already been generated by such catalytic hydrogenation reactions e.g. 2 methoxy 4 propyl cyclohexanol 58 was obtained in near quantitative amounts from eugenol 33 Maillerer E. U.S. Pat. No. 4 904 465 1990 . Newer catalytic systems however have the exciting potential to dramatically improve the reduction conditions e.g. as recently reported for the quantitative hydrogenation of several benzene analogues at room temperature and atmospheric hydrogen pressure using ruthenium containing methylated cyclodextrin catalysts Nowicki et al. 2006 296 298 . Therefore according to additional aspects the presently disclosed biotechnology applications provide important new sources of biofuels bioenergy.

In summary the prior art biotechnological lignin reduction endeavors thus far reported have in general resulted in plants apparently unsuitable for large scale cultivation resulting from compromised vasculature and perhaps higher susceptibility to pathogen attacks as well. Similarly lignin represents a challenge in the processing of plant biomass e.g. corn switchgrass or miscanthus for biofuel bioethanol generation using current fermentation techniques. Therefore applicants have herein provided some solutions through the application of a newly elucidated metabolic process sharing the same lignin biochemical precursors i.e. the biosynthesis of liquid allyl and propenyl phenols. The pertinent enzymes genes and specific biochemical precursors in this process have been isolated and described thus lending themselves to exploitation through bioengineering.

Variants of the novel disclosed PLR CS ES homologue polypeptides have substantial utility in various aspects of the present invention. Variants can be naturally or non naturally occurring. Naturally occurring variants are found in plants or other life forms and comprise amino acid sequences which are significantly or substantially identical to the amino acid sequences shown herein and include natural sequence polymorphisms. Species homologs of the protein can be obtained using subgenomic polynucleotides of the invention as described below to make suitable probes or primers for screening cDNA expression libraries from other plant species for example identifying cDNAs which encode homologs of the protein and expressing the cDNAs as is known in the art.

Non naturally occurring variants which retain substantially the same biological activities as naturally occurring protein variants including the PLR CS ES homologue activities disclosed herein and the modulation of carbon metabolism are also included here. Preferably naturally or non naturally occurring variants have amino acid sequences or corresponding nucleic acid sequences which are at least 45 55 65 75 85 90 95 97 98 or 99 identical to the amino acid sequence shown herein. More preferably the molecules are at least 98 or 99 identical. Percent identity is determined using any method known in the art. A non limiting example is the Smith Waterman homology search algorithm using an affine gap search with a gap open penalty of 12 and a gap extension penalty of 1. The Smith Waterman homology search algorithm is taught in Smith and Waterman 2 482 489 1981.

As used herein amino acid residue refers to an amino acid formed upon chemical digestion hydrolysis of a polypeptide at its peptide linkages. The amino acid residues described herein are generally in the L isomeric form. Residues in the D isomeric form can be substituted for any L amino acid residue as long as the desired functional property is retained by the polypeptide. NHrefers to the free amino group present at the amino terminus of a polypeptide. COOH refers to the free carboxy group present at the carboxyl terminus of a polypeptide. In keeping with standard polypeptide nomenclature described in 243 3552 59 1969 and adopted at 37 C.F.R. 1.821 1.822 abbreviations for amino acid residues are shown in Table 7 

It should be noted that all amino acid residue sequences represented herein by a formula have a left to right orientation in the conventional direction of amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. In addition the phrase amino acid residue is defined to include the amino acids listed in the Table of Correspondence and modified and unusual amino acids such as those referred to in 37 C.F.R. 1.821 1.822 and incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore it should be noted that a dash at the beginning or end of an amino acid residue sequence indicates a peptide bond to a further sequence of one or more amino acid residues or to an amino terminal group such as NHor to a carboxyl terminal group such as COOH.

Guidance in determining which amino acid residues can be substituted inserted or deleted without abolishing biological or immunological activity can be found using computer programs well known in the art such as DNASTAR software. Preferably amino acid changes in the protein variants disclosed herein are conservative amino acid changes i.e. substitutions of similarly charged or uncharged amino acids. A conservative amino acid change involves substitution of one of a family of amino acids which are related in their side chains. Naturally occurring amino acids are generally divided into four families acidic aspartate glutamate basic lysine arginine histidine non polar alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan and uncharged polar glycine asparagine glutamine cystine serine threonine tyrosine amino acids. Phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine are sometimes classified jointly as aromatic amino acids.

In a peptide or protein suitable conservative substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and generally can be made without altering a biological activity of a resulting molecule. Those of skill in this art recognize that in general single amino acid substitutions in non essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity see e.g. Watson et al. 4th Edition 1987 The Benjamin Cummings Pub. Co. p. 224 .

Other substitutions also are permissible and can be determined empirically or in accord with other known conservative or non conservative substitutions.

Variants of the PLR CS ES homologue polypeptide disclosed herein include glycosylated forms aggregative conjugates with other molecules and covalent conjugates with unrelated chemical moieties e.g. pegylated molecules . Covalent variants can be prepared by linking functionalities to groups which are found in the amino acid chain or at the N or C terminal residue as is known in the art. Variants also include allelic variants species variants and muteins. Truncations or deletions of regions which do not affect functional activity of the proteins are also variants.

A subset of mutants called muteins is a group of polypeptides in which neutral amino acids such as serines are substituted for cysteine residues which do not participate in disulfide bonds. These mutants may be stable over a broader temperature range than native proteins Mark et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 959 314 .

It is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine an aspartate with a glutamate a threonine with a serine or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on the biological properties of the resulting secreted protein or polypeptide variant. Properties and functions of PLR CS ES homologue polypeptide protein or polypeptide variants are of the same type as a protein comprising the amino acid sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequences shown herein although the properties and functions of variants can differ in degree.

PLR CS ES homologue polypeptide variants include glycosylated forms aggregative conjugates with other molecules and covalent conjugates with unrelated chemical moieties e.g. pegylated molecules . PLR CS ES homologue polypeptide variants also include allelic variants e.g. polymorphisms species variants and muteins. Truncations or deletions of regions which do not preclude functional activity of the proteins are also variants. Covalent variants can be prepared by linking functionalities to groups which are found in the amino acid chain or at the N or C terminal residue as is known in the art.

It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequence of the PLR CS ES homologue polypeptides of the invention can be varied without significant effect on the structure or function of the protein. If such differences in sequence are contemplated it should be remembered that there are critical areas on the protein which determine activity. In general it is possible to replace residues that form the tertiary structure provided that residues performing a similar function are used. In other instances the type of residue may be completely unimportant if the alteration occurs at a non critical region of the protein. Thus the PLR CS ES homologue polypeptides of the present invention may include one or more amino acid substitutions deletions or additions either from natural mutations or human manipulation.

Of particular interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with another charged amino acid and with neutral or negatively charged amino acids. The latter result in proteins with reduced positive charge to improve the characteristics of the disclosed protein. The prevention of aggregation is highly desirable. Aggregation of proteins not only results in a loss of activity but can also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations because they can be immunogenic Pinckard et al. 2 331 340 1967 Robbins et al. 36 838 845 1987 Cleland et al. 10 307 377 1993 .

Amino acids in the PLR CS ES homologue polypeptides of the present invention that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art such as site directed mutagenesis or alanine scanning mutagenesis Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as the catalytic activities described herein. Sites that are critical for ligand receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling Smith et al. 224 899 904 1992 and de Vos et al. 255 306 312 1992 .

As indicated changes are preferably of a minor nature such as conservative amino acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein. Of course the number of amino acid substitutions a skilled artisan would make depends on many factors including those described above. Generally speaking the number of substitutions for any given PLR CS ES homologue polypeptide will not be more than about 50 40 30 25 20 15 10 5 3 2 or 1.

In addition pegylation of PLR CS ES homologue polypeptides and or muteins is expected to provide such improved properties as increased half life solubility and protease resistance. Pegylation is well known in the art.

Fusion proteins comprising proteins or polypeptide fragments of PLR CS ES homologue polypeptides can also be constructed. Fusion proteins are useful for generating antibodies against amino acid sequences and for use in various targeting and assay systems. For example fusion proteins can be used to identify proteins which interact with a PLR CS ES homologue polypeptide of the invention or which interfere with its biological function. Physical methods such as protein affinity chromatography or library based assays for protein protein interactions such as the yeast two hybrid or phage display systems can also be used for this purpose. Such methods are well known in the art and can also be used as drug screens. Fusion proteins comprising a signal sequence can be used.

A fusion protein comprises two protein segments fused together by means of a peptide bond. Amino acid sequences for use in fusion proteins of the invention can utilize the amino acid sequences disclosed herein e.g. contiguous amino acid residues corresponding to different reading frames of the PLR CS ES homologue coding sequences frame shift protein variants etc or can be prepared from biologically active variants thereof. The first protein segment can include a full length PLR CS ES homologue polypeptide.

Other first protein segments can consist of amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS 2 4 6 18 20 and 22 and fragments of of SEQ ID NOS 2 4 6 18 20 and 22 of about 5 about 10 about 20 about 30 about 50 or more contiguous residues in length.

The second protein segment can be a full length protein or a polypeptide fragment. The second protein can be homologous or heterologous. Heterologous proteins commonly used in fusion protein construction include galactosidase glucuronidase green fluorescent protein GFP autofluorescent proteins including blue fluorescent protein BFP glutathione S transferase GST luciferase horseradish peroxidase HRP and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase CAT . Additionally epitope tags can be used in fusion protein constructions including histidine His tags FLAG tags influenza hemagglutinin HA tags Myc tags VSV G tags and thioredoxin Trx tags. Other fusion constructions can include maltose binding protein MBP S tag Lex a DNA binding domain DBD fusions GAL4 DNA binding domain fusions and herpes simplex virus HSV BP16 protein fusions.

These fusions can be made for example by a frame shift process or alternatively by covalently linking two protein segments or by standard procedures in the art of molecular biology. Recombinant DNA methods can be used to prepare fusion proteins for example by making a DNA construct which comprises a coding region for the PLR CS ES homologue protein sequence in proper reading frame with a nucleotide encoding the second protein segment and expressing the DNA construct in a host cell as is known in the art. Many kits for constructing fusion proteins are available from companies that supply research labs with tools for experiments including for example Promega Corporation Madison Wisc. Stratagene La Jolla Calif. Clontech Mountain View Calif. Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz Calif. MBL International Corporation MIC Watertown Mass. and Quantum Biotechnologies Montreal Canada 1 888 DNA KITS .

One skilled in the art will readily recognize that antibody preparations nucleic acid probes DNA and RNA and the like may be prepared and used to screen and recover homologous or related PLR CS ES homologue nucleic acids and proteins from a variety of plant sources. Typically nucleic acid probes are labeled to allow detection preferably with radioactivity although enzymes or other methods may also be used. For immunological screening methods antibody preparations either monoclonal or polyclonal are utilized. Polyclonal antibodies although less specific typically are more useful for gene isolation. For detection the antibody is labeled using radioactivity or any one of a variety of second antibody enzyme conjugate systems that are commercially available and well known in the art.

Homologous sequences are found when there is an identity of sequence and may be determined upon comparison of sequence information nucleic acid or amino acid or through hybridization reactions between a known PLR CS ES homologue and a candidate source. Conservative changes see in more detail below such as Glu Asp Val Ile Ser Thr Arg Lys and Gln Asn may also be considered in determining sequence homology.

Typically a lengthy nucleic acid sequence may show as little as 50 60 60 70 70 to 80 sequence identity and more preferably at least about 70 or about 80 sequence identity between the target sequence and the given plant PLR CS ES homologue of interest excluding any deletions which may be present and still be considered related. Amino acid sequences are considered homologous by as little as 25 sequence identity between the two complete mature proteins see generally Doolittle R. F. Of URFS and ORFS University Science Books California 1987 .

To obtain additional PLR CS ES homologues a genomic or other appropriate library prepared from the candidate plant source of interest is probed with conserved sequences from one or more PLR CS ES homologue to identify homologously related sequences. Positive clones are then analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and or sequencing. When a genomic library is used one or more sequences may be identified providing both the coding region as well as the transcriptional regulatory elements of the gene from such plant source. Probes can also be considerably shorter than the entire sequence. Oligonucleotides see below in more detail may be used for example but should be at least about 10 preferably at least about 15 at least about 18 at least about 19 at least about 20 at least about 25 at least about 50 or at least about 100 and preferably at least about 19 or about 20 nucleotides in length. When shorter length regions are used for comparison a higher degree of sequence identity is required than for longer sequences. Shorter probes are often particularly useful for polymerase chain reactions PCR especially when highly conserved sequences can be identified. When longer nucleic acid fragments are employed 100 bp as probes especially when using complete or large cDNA sequences moderately high stringencies for example using 50 formamide at 37 C. with minimal washing can still be used for screening to obtain signal from the target sample with 20 50 deviation i.e. homologous sequences.

Not only can PLR CS ES homologue sequences such as shown herein be used to identify homologous additional PLR CS ES homologue sequences but the resulting sequences obtained therefrom may also provide a further method to obtain additional PLR CS ES homologues from other plant sources. In particular PCR may be a useful technique to obtain related additional plant PLR CS ES homologues from sequence data provided herein. One skilled in the art will be able to design oligonucleotide probes based upon sequence comparisons or regions of typically highly conserved sequence.

Once the nucleic acid sequence is obtained the transcription or transcription and translation expression of the additional PLR CS ES homologue s in a host cell is desired to produce a ready source of the enzyme and or modify the carbon composition found therein. Other useful applications may be found when the host cell is a plant host cell in vitro and in vivo. Additionally as disclosed herein yeast may be used. For example by increasing the amount of one or more PLR CS ES homologue enzymes available to the plant biosynthetic complex moulation of carbon flow as described herein may be acheived. In a like manner for some applications by decreasing the amount of particular enzymes e.g. desaturase enzymes and or fatty acyl elongases available to the plant in conjunction with an increase of the amount of one or more PLR CS ES homologue enzymes available a substantial moulation of carbon flow may be acheived.

The nucleic acid sequences which encode plant PLR CS ES homologue enzymes may be used in various constructs for example as probes to obtain further sequences. Alternatively these sequences may be used in conjunction with appropriate regulatory sequences to increase levels of the respective PLR CS ES homologue enzymes of interest in a host cell for recovery or study of the enzyme in vitro or in vivo or to decrease levels or activities of other enzymes of interest for some applications when the host cell is a plant entity including plant cells plant parts including but not limited to seeds cuttings or tissues and plants.

A nucleic acid sequence encoding a novel plant PLR CS ES homologue enzyme disclosed herein may include genomic cDNA or mRNA sequence. Encoding means that the sequence corresponds to a particular amino acid sequence either in a sense or anti sense orientation. By extrachromosomal is meant that the sequence is outside of the plant genome of which it is naturally associated. Recombinant means that the sequence contains a genetically engineered modification through manipulation via mutagenesis restriction enzymes and the like. A cDNA sequence may or may not contain pre processing sequences such as transit peptide sequences. Transit peptide sequences facilitate the delivery of the protein to a given organelle and are cleaved from the amino acid moiety upon entry into the organelle releasing the mature sequence. The use of a precursor plant PLR CS ES homologue DNA sequence is preferred in plant cell expression cassettes. Other transit peptide sequences such as a transit peptide of seed ACP may be employed to translocate the plant PLR CS ES homologue enzymes of this invention to various organelles of interest. Likewise once a given plant PLR CS ES homologue transit peptide is obtained it may be used to translocate sequences other than its native coding region.

The complete genomic sequence of the plant PLR CS ES homologue enzymes may be obtained by the screening of a genomic library with a probe such as a cDNA probe and isolating those sequences which for example regulate expression in plant tissue. In this manner the transcription and translation initiation regions introns and or transcript termination regions of the plant PLR CS ES homologue enzymes may be obtained for use in a variety of DNA constructs with or without the PLR CS ES homologue enzymes structural gene. Thus nucleic acid sequences corresponding to the plant PLR CS ES homologue enzymes of this invention may also provide signal sequences useful to direct transport to a cellular organelle e.g. into a plastid 5 upstream non coding regulatory regions promoters having useful tissue and timing profiles 3 downstream non coding regulatory region useful as transcriptional and translational regulatory regions and may lend insight into other features of the gene.

Once the desired plant PLR CS ES homologue nucleic acid sequence is obtained it may be manipulated in a variety of ways. Where the sequence involves non coding flanking regions the flanking regions may be subjected to resection mutagenesis etc. Thus transitions transversions deletions and insertions may be performed on the naturally occurring sequence. In addition all or part of the sequence may be synthesized. In the structural gene one or more codons may be modified to provide for a modified amino acid sequence or one or more codon mutations may be introduced to provide for a convenient restriction site or other purpose involved with construction or expression. The structural gene may be further modified by employing synthetic adapters linkers to introduce one or more convenient restriction sites or the like.

The nucleic acid or amino acid sequences encoding an inventive plant PLR CS ES homologue may be combined with other non native or heterologous sequences in a variety of ways. By heterologous sequences is meant any sequence which is not naturally found joined to the plant PLR CS ES homologue including for example combinations of nucleic acid sequences from the same plant which are not naturally found joined together.

The DNA sequence encoding an inventive plant PLR CS ES homologues may be employed in conjunction with all or part of the gene sequences normally associated with the PLR CS ES homologue s . In its component parts for example a DNA PLR CS ES homologue encoding sequence is combined in a DNA construct having in the 5 to 3 direction of transcription a transcription initiation control region capable of promoting transcription and translation in a host cell the DNA sequence encoding one or more plant PLR CS ES homologues and a transcription and translation termination region.

Potential host cells include both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells e.g. plant cells yeast etc. . A host cell may be unicellular or found in a multicellular differentiated or undifferentiated organism depending upon the intended use. Inventive cells may be distinguished by having a plant PLR CS ES homologue foreign to the wild type cell present therein for example by having a recombinant nucleic acid construct encoding a plant PLR CS ES homologue therein.

Depending upon the host the regulatory regions may vary including regions from viral plasmid or chromosomal genes or the like. For expression in prokaryotic or eukaryotic microorganisms particularly unicellular hosts a wide variety of constitutive or regulatable promoters may be employed. Expression in a microorganism can provide a ready source of the plant enzyme. Among transcriptional initiation regions which have been described are regions from bacterial and yeast hosts such as including genes such as beta galactosidase T7 polymerase tryptophan E and the like.

Generally the constructs will involve regulatory regions functional in plants plant tissues e.g. seed tissue or other organisms e.g. yeast which provide for modified production of plant PLR CS ES homologues and possibly modification of the carbon composition and or accumulation level . The open reading frame coding for the plant PLR CS ES homologue or functional fragments thereof will be joined at its 5 end to a transcription initiation regulatory region such as for example the wild type sequence naturally found 5 upstream to the respective PLR CS ES homologue structural gene. Numerous other transcription initiation regions are available which provide for a wide variety of constitutive or regulatable e.g. inducible transcription of the structural gene functions. Among transcriptional initiation regions used for plants are such regions associated with the structural genes such as for nopaline and mannopine synthases or with napin ACP promoters and the like. The transcription translation initiation regions corresponding to such structural genes are found immediately 5 upstream to the respective start codons. In embodiments wherein the expression of one or more of the PLR CS ES homologue proteins is desired in a plant host the use of all or part of the complete plant PLR CS ES homologue gene is desired namely all or part of the 5 upstream non coding regions promoter together with the structural gene sequence and 3 downstream non coding regions may be employed. Alternatively if a different promoter is desired such as a promoter native to the plant host of interest or a modified promoter i.e. having transcription initiation regions derived from one gene source and translation initiation regions derived from a different gene source including the sequences encoding the PLR CS ES homologue of interest or enhanced promoters such as double 35S CaMV promoters the sequences may be joined together using standard techniques.

For such applications when 5 upstream non coding regions are obtained from other genes regulated during seed maturation those preferentially expressed in plant embryo tissue such as ACP and napin derived transcription initiation control regions are desired. Such seed specific promoters may be obtained and used in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Ser. No. 07 147 781 filed Jan. 25 1988 now U.S. Ser. No. 07 550 804 filed Jul. 9 1990 and U.S. Ser. No. 07 494 722 filed on or about Mar. 16 1990 having a title Novel Sequences Preferentially Expressed In Early Seed Development and Methods Related Thereto which references are hereby incorporated by reference. Transcription initiation regions which are preferentially expressed in seed tissue i.e. which are undetectable in other plant parts are considered desirable for carbon pathway modifications and or accumulation in order to minimize any disruptive or adverse effects of the gene product.

Regulatory transcript termination regions may be provided in DNA constructs of this invention as well. Transcript termination regions may be provided by the DNA sequence encoding the plant PLR CS ES homologue or a convenient transcription termination region derived from a different gene source for example the transcript termination region which is naturally associated with the transcript initiation region. In particular embodiments e.g. where the transcript termination region is from a different gene source it will contain at least about 0.5 kb preferably about 1 3 kb of sequence 3 to the structural gene from which the termination region is derived.

Plant expression or transcription constructs having a plant PLR CS ES homologue as the DNA sequence of interest for increased or decreased expression thereof may be employed with a wide variety of plant life particularly plant life involved in the production of for example oils for edible and industrial uses. Particular embodiments comprise temperate oilseed crops. Plants of interest include but are not limited to rapeseed Canola and High Erucic Acid varieties sunflower safflower cotton Cuphea soybean peanut coconut and oil palms and corn. Depending on the method for introducing the recombinant constructs into the host cell other DNA sequences may be required. Importantly this invention is applicable to dicotyledon and monocotyledon species alike and will be readily applicable to new and or improved transformation and regulation techniques.

The method of transformation is not critical to the instant invention various methods of plant transformation are currently available. As newer methods are available to transform crops they may be directly applied hereunder. For example many plant species naturally susceptible to infection may be successfully transformed via tripartite or binary vector methods of mediated transformation. Additionally techniques of microinjection DNA particle bombardment electroporation have been developed which allow for the transformation of various monocot and dicot plant species.

In developing the DNA construct the various components of the construct or fragments thereof will normally be inserted into a convenient cloning vector which is capable of replication in a bacterial host e.g. . Numerous vectors exist that have been described in the literature. After each cloning the plasmid may be isolated and subjected to further manipulation such as restriction insertion of new fragments ligation deletion insertion resection etc. so as to tailor the components of the desired sequence. Once the construct has been completed it may then be transferred to an appropriate vector for further manipulation in accordance with the manner of transformation of the host cell.

Normally included with the DNA construct will be a structural gene having the necessary regulatory regions for expression in a host and providing for selection of transformant cells. The gene may provide for resistance to a cytotoxic agent e.g. antibiotic heavy metal toxin etc. complementation providing prototrophy to an auxotrophic host viral immunity or the like. Depending upon the number of different host species the expression construct or components thereof are introduced one or more markers may be employed where different conditions for selection are used for the different hosts.

It is noted that the degeneracy of the DNA code provides that some codon substitutions are permissible of DNA sequences without any corresponding modification of the amino acid sequence.

As mentioned above the manner in which the DNA construct is introduced into the plant host is not critical to this invention. Any method which provides for efficient transformation may be employed. Various methods for plant cell transformation include the use of Ti or Ri plasmids microinjection electroporation DNA particle bombardment liposome fusion DNA bombardment or the like. In many instances it will be desirable to have the construct bordered on one or both sides by T DNA particularly having the left and right borders more particularly the right border. This is particularly useful when the construct uses or as a mode for transformation although the T DNA borders may find use with other modes of transformation.

Where is used for plant cell transformation a vector may be used which may be introduced into the host for homologous recombination with T DNA or the Ti or Ri plasmid present in the host. The Ti or Ri plasmid containing the T DNA for recombination may be armed capable of causing gall formation or disarmed incapable of causing gall formation the latter being permissible so long as the vir genes are present in the transformed host. The armed plasmid can give a mixture of normal plant cells and gall.

In some instances where is used as the vehicle for transforming plant cells the expression construct bordered by the T DNA border s will be inserted into a broad host spectrum vector there being broad host spectrum vectors described in the literature. Commonly used is pRK2 or derivatives thereof. Included with the expression construct and the T DNA will be one or more markers which allow for selection of transformed and transformed plant cells. A number of markers have been developed for use with plant cells such as resistance to chloramphenicol the aminoglycoside G418 hygromycin or the like. The particular marker employed is not essential to this invention one or another marker being preferred depending on the particular host and the manner of construction.

For transformation of plant cells using explants may be combined and incubated with the transformed for sufficient time for transformation the bacteria killed and the plant cells cultured in an appropriate selective medium. Once callus forms shoot formation can be encouraged by employing the appropriate plant hormones in accordance with known methods and the shoots transferred to rooting medium for regeneration of plants. The plants may then be grown to seed and the seed used to establish repetitive generations and for isolation of vegetable oils.

Once a transgenic plant is obtained which is capable of producing seed having a modified carbon pathway and or carbon product composition and or accumulation level traditional plant breeding techniques including methods of mutagensis may be employed to further manipulate the carbon composition. Alternatively additional carbon pathway modifying DNA sequences may be introduced via genetic engineering to further manipulate the carbon composition. It is noted that the method of transformation is not critical to this invention. However the use of genetic engineering plant transformation methods e.g. to insert a single desired DNA sequence is critical. Heretofore the ability to modify the carbon composition of plant oils was limited to the introduction of traits that could be sexually transferred during plant crosses or viable traits generated through mutagensis. Through the use of genetic engineering techniques which permit the introduction of inter species genetic information and the means to regulate the tissue specific expression of endogenous genes a new method is available for the production of for example plant oils or modified carbon pathways as described herein or carbon compositions and or accumulations using the inventive PLR CS ES homologue nucleic acids and proteins. In addition there is the potential for the development of novel plant oils and products upon application of the tools described herein.

One may choose to provide for the transcription or transcription and translation of one or more other sequences of interest in concert with the expression of a plant PLR CS ES homologue in a plant host cell. In particular the reduced expression of one or more plant enzymes in combination with expression of a plant PLR CS ES homologue may be preferred in some applications.

For providing a plant transformed for the combined effect of more than one nucleic acid sequence of interest typically but not necessarily a separate nucleic acid construct will be provided for each. The constructs as described above contain transcriptional or transcriptional or transcriptional and translational regulatory control regions. One skilled in the art will be able to determine regulatory sequences to provide for a desired timing and tissue specificity appropriate to the final product in accord with the above principles e.g. respective expression or anti sense constructs . When two or more constructs are to be employed it may be desired that different regulatory sequences be employed in each cassette to reduce spontaneous homologous recombination between sequences. The constructs may be introduced into the host cells by the same or different methods including the introduction of such a trait by crossing transgenic plants via traditional plant breeding methods so long as the resulting product is a plant having both characteristics integrated into its genome.

An inventive plant PLR CS ES homologue includes any sequence of amino acids such as a protein polypeptide or peptide fragment obtainable from a plant source which is capable of catalyzing the respective biological activity in a plant host cell i.e. in vivo or in a plant cell like environment i.e. in vitro. A plant cell like environment means that any necessary conditions are available in an environment i.e. such factors as temperatures pH lack of inhibiting substances which will permit the enzyme to function.

By decreasing the amount of one or more enzymes modulation of carbon allocation may be provided. Using anti sense transwitch ribozyme or some other expression reducing technology e.g. mutants a decrease in the amount of one or more PLR CS ES homologues available to the plant cell is produced.

By manipulation of various aspects of the DNA constructs e.g. choice of promoters number of copies etc. and traditional breeding methods one skilled in the art may achieve even greater modulation of cabon pathways and product accumulation in plant species.

Examples of inventive 20 mer oligonucleotides include the following set of 908 oligomers and the antisense set complementary thereto indicated by polynucleotide positions with reference to SEQ ID NO 1 

Likewise examples of inventive 25 mer oligonucleotides include the following set of 903 oligomers and the antisense set complementary thereto indicated by polynucleotide positions with reference to SEQ ID NO 1 

The present invention encompasses for each of SEQ ID NOS 1 3 and 5 etc. sense and antisense multiple consecutively overlapping sets of oligonucleotides or modified oligonucleotides of length X where e.g. X 9 10 17 20 22 23 25 27 30 or 35 nucleotides.

The oligonucleotides or oligomers according to the present invention constitute effective tools useful to modulate expression e.g. siRNA and antisense and to ascertain genetic and epigenetic parameters of the genomic sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NOS 1 3 5 17 19 and 21. Preferred sets of such oligonucleotides or modified oligonucleotides of length X are those consecutively overlapping sets of oligomers corresponding to SEQ ID NOS 1 3 5 17 19 and 21 and to the complements thereof .

Example summary. The creosote bush accumulates a complex mixture of 8 8 regiospecifically linked lignans of which the potent antioxidant nordihydroguaiaretic acid NDGA 40 is the most abundant. Its tetra O methyl derivative M4N 41 is showing considerable promise in the treatment of the refractory hard to treat cancers of the head and neck. NDGA 40 and related 9 9 deoxygenated lignans are thought to be formed by dimerization of allyl propenyl phenols phenylpropanoid compounds that lack C 9 oxygenation thus differentiating them from the more common monolignol derived lignans. In applicants ongoing studies dedicated towards elucidating the biochemical pathway to NDGA 40 and its congeners six pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase homologues PLRh SEQ ID NOS 2 4 6 18 20 and 22 were isolated from with protein obtained in recombinant form. According to aspects of the present invention all six of these enzymes catalyze the conversion of p coumaryl 48 50 and coniferyl 49 alcohol esters into the corresponding allylphenols chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 . Of these six PLRh Lt proteins one of these homologues PLRh Lt1 SEQ ID NO 2 was analyzed in greatest detail and this protein efficiently catalyzes the conversion of p coumaryl 48 50 and coniferyl 49 alcohol esters into the corresponding allylphenols chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 and neither of their propenylphenol regioisomers p anol 37 and isoeugenol 39 are formed during this enzyme reaction.

Example overview rationale. The creosote bush or chaparral is a predominant component of shrub vegetation in southern North American deserts having been traditionally used by Native American populations for various medicinal purposes 1 Other species are found in desert areas of South America from where the creosote bush is thought to have geographically originated 2 . The species is a rich source of specialized metabolites including phenolics terpenoids saponins and odorous vinyl ketones 3 . The regiospecifically 8 8 linked lignan nordihydroguaiaretic acid NDGA 40 is a prevalent and biologically active compound present in leaves flowers and young stems of and other species e.g. NDGA 40 is a strong antioxidant and also a phytotoxic allelochemical . Reported levels of NDGA 40 in creosote bush leaves vary between 3 15 of dry weight 4 and synthetic methods now allow for its versatile production as well as analogs thereof 5 . Notably NDGA 40 differs from most other natural lignans by lacking an oxygenated functionality at carbons 9 and 9 .

NDGA 40 is abundantly present in aqueous and alcoholic extracts teas and more recently capsules prepared from the creosote bush. These are traditionally used to treat most commonly diseases of renal and gynaecological origins for an excellent comprehensive review see 1 . NDGA 40 is a strong antioxidant 6 that has been shown to be an inhibitor of lipoxygenases 7 8 and can inhibit tumor necrosis factor TNF induced apoptosis 9 as well as the growth of several cancer cell lines 10 . The semi synthetic derivative tetra O methyl NDGA M4N 41 has antiviral 11 anti HIV 12 activities and can suppress growth of human xenograft tumors 13 it is also proceeding through NIH trials as a treatment for the particularly hard to treat cancers of head and neck.

Despite the growing potential of clinical uses for NDGA 40 and derivatives thereof its biosynthetic pathway in planta remains unknown e.g. the actual phenylpropanoid substrate undergoing dimerization has not been determined. Based on phytochemical studies a provisional pathway has been proposed 14 and is depicted in starting from the amino acid Phe 1 as the departure point from primary metabolism to generate through the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway an allylphenol such as p anol 37 . The latter could then serve as the putatively protein controlled radical radical coupling substrate to afford the 9 9 deoxygenated furanolignan larreatricin 62 . Larreatricin 62 could then be envisaged to undergo sequential hydroxylation with its furano ring then reduced to afford NDGA 40 . In this regard an enantiospecific larreatricin 3 hydroxylase from was isolated and characterized 14 but whose role as well as the role of larreatricin 62 itself in the NDGA 40 biosynthetic pathway remains to be further investigated. In this proposed pathway deoxygenation of the terminal 9 and 9 carbons of NDGA 40 would be achieved prior to coupling i.e. with an allyl propenyl phenol such as p anol 37 serving as substrate . The allyl propenyl phenol substrate upon dimerization could afford the 8 8 linked 9 9 deoxygenated lignans thus differing from most other lignans which appear to be hydroxycinnamyl alcohol monolignol derived. On the other hand utilization of monolignols as substrates for coupling with subsequent deoxygenation could not be ruled out as experimental evidence for either pathway was insufficient.

Several other 9 9 deoxygenated lignans are also of growing medicinal interest due to their potential biological activities again emphasizing the need to fully establish their biosynthetic pathways in planta. These include the cancer cell pro apoptotic licarin A 64 from 15 and 16 the anti Chagasic 17 grandisin 65 from 18 and 19 as well as the antioxidant gomisin A 66 from a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine to protect the liver 20 21 . In a manner analogous to NDGA 40 all of these 9 9 deoxygenated lignans can be envisaged to be biosynthesized from allyl propenyl phenol monomers bearing different ring substitution patterns these would undergo regio and or enantio specific dimerization to afford the lignan carbon skeleta with further peripheral ring modifications e.g. hydroxylation O methylation or methylenedioxy bridge formation .

Allyl propenyl phenols have also attracted much interest as monomers due to their flavor fragrance properties 22 as well as their potential uses as antimicrobials. Eugenol 33 the most abundant natural allylphenol is present in several commercially important spices e.g. cloves and cinnamon. Eugenol 33 has antimicrobial activity against many pathogenic bacteria fungi and nematodes 23 and references therein while being classified as GRAS Generally Recognized As Safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its use as a flavoring agent. Anethole 38 is a major component of anise oil and is used as a flavoring perfume agent whereas the regioisomer methylchavicol 32 is present in the essential oil of several herbs like tarragon and has acaricidal properties 24 .

The biosynthetic pathway leading to these monomeric C 9 deoxygenated phenylpropanoids was recently elucidated in basil and . It was established that hydroxycinnamyl alcohol esters could serve as substrates for regiospecific NADPH dependent reductases that catalyze their conversion into allyl propenyl phenols i.e. p coumaryl acetate 48 and p coumaryl coumarate 50 can be transformed into chavicol 31 and or p anol 37 while coniferyl acetate 48 can be converted into eugenol 33 and or isoeugenol 39 25 26 . These NAD P H dependent reductases bear highest amino acid homology TABLES 1a 1b to members of the PIP family of enzymes that we have previously extensively characterized namely pinoresinol lariciresinol isoflavone and phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductases 27 310.

Isolation of LtPLRh1 LtCES1 PLRh Lt1 LtPLRh2 LtCES2 PLRh Lt2 Lt PLR13 LtCES3 LtCES4 LtCES5 and LtCES6. A cDNA library was constructed from leaf tissue and plated for primary screening. Plates were blotted onto Magna Nylon membranes circles Micron Separation Inc. which were then allowed to air dry. The membranes were placed between two layers of Whatman 3MM Chr paper and cDNA library phage DNA was fixed to the membranes with denaturing in one step by 3 min autoclaving at 100 C. with fast exhaust. The membranes were next washed for 60 min with gentle shaking at 45 C. with 6 standard saline citrate SSC and 0.1 SDS then prehybridized for 5 h with gentle shaking at 58 C. in preheated 6 SSC 0.5 SDS and 5 Denhardt s reagent prehybridization solution 200 ml . The P labeled probe Fi PlrII was denatured 100 C. 10 min quickly cooled on ice 15 min and added to fresh preheated hybridization solution 120 ml at 47 C. . The prehybridized membranes were next added to the dish which was covered with plastic wrap and hybridization was performed for 31 h at 47 C. with gentle shaking. The membranes were then washed in 4 SSC and 0.5 SDS 250 ml for 10 min at RT transferred to preheated 2 SSC and 0.5 SDS 250 ml and incubated at 47 C. for 15 min with gentle shaking. After removal from the dish and wrapping in plastic wrap to prevent drying the membranes were finally exposed to Kodak X OMAT AR film for 46 h at 80 C. between intensifying screens. Fifteen positive plaques were purified through another round of screening under the same conditions as above. Nine purified cDNA clones were rescued from the phage following Stratagene s in vivo excision protocol. The cDNAs rescued in pBluescript SK were sequenced using T3 and T7 primers and particular cDNA clones showed high homology e.g. some with 60 identity to known PLR reductases TABLE 1C thus being named LtPLRh1 LtCES1 PLRh Lt1 LtPLRh2 LtCES2 PLRh Lt2 and Lt PLR13 LtCES3 . The genes e.g. LtPLRh1 LtCES1 were amplified with a sticky BamH I 5 terminal end and a sticky EcoR I 3 terminal end. After ligation to the BamH I and EcoR I pre digested pGEX 4T 1 plasmid vector the respective expression construct e.g. LtPLRh1 pGEX 4T 1 was transformed into TOP10 cells for sequence verification.

The three clones LtCES4 LtCES5 and LtCES6 were isolated using degenerate primers designed from regions of homology between LtCES1 and LtCES2. They are about 88 similar and 75 identical to LtCES1 at the protein seqeunce level See Tables 1D E and F .

Protein Purification. For LtPLRh1 LtCES1 expression for example purified plasmid DNA LtPLRh1 LtCES1 pGEX 4T 1 was transformed into BL21 CodonPlus DE3 RIL cells according to Stratagene s instructions. Transformed cells 250 ml cultures were grown in Fernbach flasks at 37 C. with shaking 230 rpm to OD 0.8 1.0 in LB medium supplemented with 100 g ml carbenicillin. Cell suspensions were cooled down on ice with gentle agitation for 20 min and induced with IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. After 24 h incubation at 20 C. 230 rpm cells were pelleted by centrifugation 3500 g 25 min 4 C. and stored at 80 C. for at least 2 h to facilitate cell lysis. Pellets were thawed at 37 C. for 5 min and resuspended in 25 ml of BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent Novagen containing 25 l Benzonase nuclease 25 units l and 2 l rLysozyme solution 30 kilounits l . After incubation at room temperature for 5 min with gentle shaking the cell suspension was left on ice for 30 min and subsequently centrifuged 16 000 g 25 min at 4 C. to remove cell debris. After filtration 0.45 m the supernatant 25 ml was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin 1 ml bed volume GE Healthcare pre equilibrated with 20 ml 1 PBS buffer 140 mM NaCl 2.7 mM KCl 10.1 mM NaHPO 1.8 mM KHPO pH adjusted to 7.3 with the whole transferred to a Poly Prep Column Bio Rad which was then washed with 50 ml of ice cold 1 PBS buffer. The bound material was eluted with 10 mM glutathione in 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0. Fractions containing the GST fusion protein identified by SDS PAGE analysis were combined and thrombin protease was added 10 cleavage units per mg of fusion protein with incubation at RT for 12 h. Once digestion was complete glutathione was removed by extensive dialysis 1000 volumes against 1 PBS buffer followed by removal of GST tag on Glutathione Sepharose 4B. The LtPLRh1 LtCES1 purified to apparent homogeneity was eluted in the flow through volume of the column .

Site directed mutagenesis generation of LtPLRh1 LtCES1  K133A. Originally the LtPLRh1 LtCES1 pGEX 4T 1 constructed plasmid DNA was maintained in TOP 10 cells dam dcm strain . Using plasmid DNA isolated from the strain as a template site directed mutagenesis of LtPLRh1 LtCES1 was carried out using a QuickChange XL Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit Stratagene with the primers 5 CTACATTTGAAATGGCGGCTCAACTCCGCAG 3 SEQ ID NO 13 and 5 CTGCGGAGTTGAGCCGCCATTTCAAATGTAG 3 SEQ ID NO 14 for K133A single point mutation. The PCR reaction was performed following the manufacturer s instructions with 7 min extension cycles at 68 C. In order to remove the parental DNA template PCR products were subjected to Dpn I restriction enzyme digestion reaction and then directly transformed into TOP10 cells. After selection on LB medium supplemented with 100 g ml carbenicillin positive transformants were subjected to DNA sequencing with pGEX vector specific primers sense 5 GGGCTGGCAAGCCACGTTTGGTG 3 SEQ ID NO 15 antisense 5 CCGGGAGCTGCATGTGTCAGAGG 3 SEQ ID NO 16 . After sequence confirmation the LtPLRh1 LtCES1 pGEX 4T 1 vector construct containing the K133A point mutation was used for transformation of BL21 CodonPlus DE3 RIL cells Stratagene with the positive clone designated as the LtPLRh1 K133A mutant. The LtPLRh1 K133A mutant protein was heterologously expressed purified and assayed following the procedure described above for the wild type LtPLRh1 LtCES1 protein.

Enzymatic assays. All assays were performed at 30 C. in 250 l of the corresponding buffered solutions at 100 mM buffer concentration containing 0.5 g LtPL LtPLRh1 LtCES1 Rh1 and 1.0 mM NADPH and were terminated by addition of 25 l glacial acetic acid and freezing. Chavicol eugenol synthase activity assays were individually performed in Bis Tris propane buffer pH 7.55 containing 0.4 mM p coumaryl coumarate 50 p coumaryl acetate 48 or coniferyl acetate 49 . Assays were carried out for 1 to 120 min controls included both boiled enzyme extracts and omission of substrates.

pH optima Assays were carried out for 30 min at each pH MES at pH 5.35 5.73 5.97 6.39 and 6.83 Bis Tris propane at pH 6.5 7.0 7.55 8.03 8.53 9.0 and 9.59 AMPD at pH 8.37 9.02 9.49 9.82 10.16 10.38 and contained 1.0 mM p coumaryl coumarate 50 coniferyl acetate 49 or 0.5 mM p coumaryl acetate 48 .

Kinetic parameters Kand V Three sets of triplicate assays were carried out for 5 min in Bis Tris propane buffer at pH 7.55 and contained different concentrations of p coumaryl acetate 48 p coumaryl coumarate 50 or coniferyl acetate 49 3.2 M 1 mM .

Inhibition studies Assays were carried out in duplicate for 5 min in Bis Tris propane buffer at pH 7.55 and contained 0.2 mM p coumaryl acetate 48 or coniferyl acetate 49 and different concentrations of p coumaryl alcohol 19 coniferyl alcohol 21 p coumaric acid 4 chavicol 31 or eugenol 33 0 0.5 mM .

This Example 1 discloses the the isolation and characterization of six PIP reductase homologues LtPLRh1 LtCES1 PLRh Lt1 LtPLRh2 LtCES2 PLRh Lt2 Lt PLR13 LtCES3 LtCES4 LtCES5 and LtCES6 SEQ ID NOS 2 4 6 18 20 and 22. respectively that catalyze the C 7 reduction of p coumaryl and coniferyl alcohol esters 48 50 TABLES 1A 1B and 1C in the presence of NADPH or NADH to form chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 respectively. In particular the PIP reductase homologue LtPLRh1 LtCES1 has been characterized in most detail and efficiently catalyzes the C 7 reduction of p coumaryl and coniferyl alcohol esters in the presence of NADPH or NADH to form chavicol and eugenol respectively. Based on previously reported kinetic parameters for the recently characterized homologues in basil and 26 this enzyme appears to be over 100 fold more efficient for eugenol 33 formation. LtCES1 also reduces p coumaryl alcohol esters 48 50 to afford chavicol 31 with comparable substrate affinity and efficiency. Amino acid homologies between LtPLRh1 LtCES1 PLRh Lt1 and its basil homologues are relatively low within the PIP enzyme family with the two latter enzymes being closer homologues of bona fide PLRs from other organisms than LtPLRh1 LtCES1 .

In initial studies of lignan biosynthesis in two homologues 60 identity of a pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase FiPLR1 were isolated from a creosote bush cDNA library using a PLR probe Fi PlrII . These were provisionally annotated as LtPLRh1 LtCES1 and 2 respectively. LtPLRh1 was successfully expressed in soluble form in an heterologous system as a 60 kDa GST fusion protein which after purification by affinity to a Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin had the 26 kDa GST protein cleaved by incubation with thrombin protease. Further purification to apparent homogeneity using Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin afforded the native 34 kDa LtPLRh1 in the flow through eluent . LtPLRh2 has 80 identity to LtPLRh1.

LtPLRh1 PLRh Lt1 LtPLRh2 PLRh Lt2 and Lt PLR13 are homologues of members of the PIP family of aromatic reductases pinoresinol lariciresinol isoflavone and phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductases TABLE 1A that Applicants have extensively characterized 27 32 . A fourth class of these proteins is able to catalyze the formation of eugenol 33 and isoeugenol 39 from coniferyl acetate 49 i.e. the recently described ObEGS1 and PhIGS1 from basil and 26 respectively whereas another study indicated that basil cell free extracts were able to additionally convert p coumaryl alcohol esters 48 50 into chavicol 31 25 . Thus all of these enzymes catalyze the NADPH dependent reductions of the phenylpropanoid derived moieties of various phenylpropanoids in either a regio or enantiospecific manner . Of these the creosote bush homologues LtPLRh1 and 2 are 88 similar and 78 identical to each other as well as being 64 similar and 49 identical to the bonafide PLR from . On the other hand they only have about 60 similarity 40 identity to the enzymes found in and basil. The latter two are in turn 56 58 homologous 38 40 identical to FiPLR TABLE 1B . A brief phylogenetic study of several proteins bearing homology to LtPLRh1 indicates closest homology to several PLR e.g. from PCBER e.g. from IFR e.g. from and leucoanthocyanidin reductases e.g. from with ObEGS1 and PhIGS1 clustering closer to bona fide PLRs than LtPLRh1 which clusters closer to more distant PLR PCBER homologues .

Several members of the PIP enzyme family have been previously characterized with three dimensional structures determined by X ray crystallography and some of the catalytically relevant residues assigned 31 . The phosphate binding sequence of the well known dinucleotide binding site Rossmann fold could be readily assigned to GxxGxxG in the N terminal 11 17 amino acids of LtPLRh1 and 2 these being homologous to residues 10 16 in FiPLR1 14 20 in EGS1 and 12 18 in IGS1 respectively TABLE 1A . In addition Tyrand Ile Leu in FiPLR1 and PhIGS1 which were proposed in 31 to interact with the pyrophosphate group of NADPH are present in LtPLRh1 as are Serand Argwhich were proposed to bind to the O 3 of adenosine and O 3 of the ribose respectively. Three other conserved residues further implicated in NADPH binding are also present in LtPLRh1 Lysinvolved in the formation of a salt bridge to the 2 phosphate of NADPH as well as Argand Phe which are thought to stack against the nicotinamide moiety of the cofactor. More importantly a Lys residue that is conserved among all PIP reductases and which is thought to be involved in catalysis as a general base is also present in LtPLRh1 Kin LtPLRh1 and 2 Kin ObEGS1 Kin PhIGS1 and Kand Kin PLR from and respectively .

The biochemical function of LtPLRh1 was initially elusive as in vitro studies showed at best marginal activity towards pinoresinol 54 larreatricin 62 nectandrin B 72 licarin A 64 dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol 56 and the commercially available isoflavones genistein 73 and biochanin A 74 . Thus LtPLRh1 did not function as an efficient PLR PCBER or IFR with the substrates tested.

Recently p coumaryl and coniferyl alcohol esters e.g. 48 50 were shown to be substrates for the crucial C9 deoxygenation leading to the corresponding allyl propenyl phenols 25 26 by the aforementioned PIP homologues ObEGS1 and PhIGS1 26 i.e. to afford chavicol 31 eugenol 33 and or isoeugenol 39 respectively. Allyl propenyl phenols have been proposed to serve as substrates for oxidative coupling reactions that lead to 9 9 deoxygenated lignans such as in the creosote bush larreatricin 62 and NDGA 40 14 i.e. deoxygenation of the terminal carbons of these lignans was achieved at a monomeric stage prior to coupling. Thus Applicants determined whether LtPLRh1 showed similar catalytic properties even though it has relatively low homology within the PIP reductases to either ObEGS1 or PhIGS1.

The potential substrates p coumaryl acetate 48 p coumaryl coumarate 50 and coniferyl acetate 49 were synthesized from commercial precursors by routes previously used in our laboratory as were the chavicol 31 and p anol 37 used as chromatographic spectroscopic standards 25 33 . Eugenol 33 and isoeugenol 39 the putative products derived from coniferyl alcohol esters were both commercially available.

Upon incubation of these potential substrates in the presence of NADPH or NADH as a hydride donor LtPLRh1 was able to efficiently convert each substrate into the corresponding allylphenols chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 . LtPLRh1 has a pH optimum of 7.5 with apparent kinetic parameters for substrates 48 50 summarized in TABLE 2. The observed reduction of p coumaryl 48 50 and coniferyl 49 alcohol esters to afford a deoxygenated side chain is therefore analogous to the one recently described in basil 25 26 which accumulates allylphenols in its essential oils thus indicating a common pathway for their production in planta.

As with other PIP reductases 34 Applicants were able to observe some substrate versatility with LtPLRh1 regarding the phenolic substitution patterns as well as the carboxylic leaving group and the enzymatic cofactor. In this aspect LtPLRh1 differs from the reductases reported in basil and which apparently can only utilize NADPH and coniferyl acetate 49 to form eugenol 33 and isoeugenol 39 respectively 26 . This observed substrate versatility is though in agreement with results obtained with a Thai basil enzymatic preparation 25 where both p coumaryl acetate 48 and coumarate 50 served as substrates with NADPH and NADH both serving as cofactors. Additionally recombinant LtPLRh1 apparently reduces coniferyl acetate 49 100 fold more efficiently than its reported homologues in basil and with comparable efficacies for p coumaryl alcohol esters 48 50 TABLE 2 .

Applicants were unable to observe traditional Michaelis Menten kinetic behavior with LtPLRh1 with substrate concentrations above those at activity maxima 0.2 0.4 mM leading in our assay system to diminished LtPLRh1 activity i.e. substrate inhibition . This kinetic behavior had been observed previously with PLR 34 and LtPLRh1 inhibition seems to be caused by presence of substrate and not enzymatic products chavicol 31 or eugenol 33 or hydrolysis side products p coumaryl alcohol 19 coniferyl alcohol 21 or p coumaric acid 4 thus the kinetic parameters reported herein are apparent values. As previously described in 25 the monolignol esters 48 50 used as substrates are unstable in aqueous solutions with hydrolysis side reaction products i.e. p coumaryl and coniferyl alcohols 19 21 as well as p coumaric acid 4 in assays including p coumaryl coumarate 50 being observed in all assays and negative controls.

Next it was instructive to investigate the effects of site directed mutagenesis of LtPLRh1 K which as described above is considered to be involved in general acid base catalysis. A point mutation of this charged residue to the catalytically inert amino acid alanine K133A resulted in abolishment of enzymatic activity. This loss of catalytic efficiency thus again apparently confirms the role of Kin catalysis possibly as a general base as proposed before with other PIP enzymes i.e. PLR Tp1 from 31 where Kis in proximity to the phenolic substrate and its Ala substitution leads to enzyme deactivation.

The slightly basic pH optimum for LtPLRh1 along with the inefficiency of Ala133 as a general base that could abstract the substrate phenolic proton both support the formation of a quinone methide intermediate in the catalytic mechanism though this remains to be further examined. Quinone methide intermediates have been implicated in the catalytic mechanism of other PIP reductases e.g. in 35 and more recently in studies of substrate versatility of PLR Tp1 from which uses several p hydroxylated phenylpropanoid substrates i.e. pinoresinol 54 medioresinol 69 syringaresinol 70 D but fails to reduce substrates with no free phenolic groups i.e. sesamin 71 34 .

In our previously proposed biosynthetic pathway for NDGA generation 14 the phenylpropanoid pathway followed by side chain deoxygenation affords p anol 37 as a substrate for protein controlled radical radical dimerization to form the 8 8 coupled lignan larreatricin 62 which is further modified to form NDGA 40 . Here LtPLRh1 forms chavicol 31 whose side chain terminal double bond precludes a similar 8 8 radical coupling reaction. The pertinence of these findings to lignan biosynthesis is presently under investigation in order to elucidate the specific steps leading to the formation of NDGA 40 .

Therefor this Example 1 describes regiospecific NAD P H dependent reductase from LtPLRh1 that catalyzes the reduction of p coumaryl 48 50 and coniferyl 49 alcohol esters to afford the corresponding allylphenols chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 . The enzyme is homologous to members of the PIP family of reductases all of which catalyze the reduction of phenylpropanoid derived side chains. Site directed mutagenesis of a catalytically active Lys residue conserved among other PIP homologues has rendered the enzyme ineffective. The LtPLRh1 kinetic parameters measured indicate an enzyme with comparable efficacy relative to other PIP reductases acting on their respective substrates but 100 fold higher activity than the enzymes reported in basil and . The significance of these results as well as an understanding of the substrate versatilities and the actual biological roles of these enzymes along with their evolutionary relationships are currently the target of our investigations.

Example summary. The discovery of reaction tissue in the forage crop alfalfa L. is described which to applicants knowledge has not hitherto been established as occurring in herbaceous perennials. It was first observed during an investigation of a transgenic alfalfa line reduced in overall lignin content but was also formed in the wild type line as well. The transgenic alfalfa line obtained through standard down regulation of the gene encoding p coumarate 3 hydroxylase pC3H was reduced in lignin content by circa 64 as expected from our previous metabolic flux analyses Anterola et al. 2002 . Comparison of the pC3H down regulated pC3H I and WT lines established several differences however when employing microscopy analyses and biomechanical testing of various internodal alfalfa branch sections. Relative to WT the pC3H I line a apparently more rapidly formed reaction tissue containing gelatinous fibers with adjacent thick walled fibers presumed to be intermediate tissue during development and in greater amount b had an increased volume of xylem tissue and c had comparable tensile dynamic modulus properties. These findings thus establish the limited ability of this perennial angiosperm to form inducible reaction tissue in a manner somewhat analogous to that of woody arborescent angiosperms. Finally with the recent rapidly growing interest in lignocellulosic materials for biofuels e.g. bioethanol the potential of effectuating reductions in lignin amounts in woody angiosperms with increased formation of reaction tension wood tissue is discussed. This is because the latter tissues are often viewed as a deleterious trait for many agronomic forestry applications e.g. due to the difficulties experienced in their subsequent processing for many industrial commercial applications.

Example overview. Lignins nature s second most abundant vascular plant biopolymer next to cellulose has essential roles in both structural support and in providing conduits for water and nutrient transport they also provide a physical barrier to opportunistic pathogens herbivores Lewis et al. 1999 . Recently biotechnological reduction of lignin amounts in transgenic lines of economically important plant species has been a research emphasis in several laboratories with various potential benefits being anticipated Anterola and Lewis 2002 . These include for example decreased lignin by product waste generation during pulp paper production improved animal feed digestibility as well as better lignocellulosic feedstocks for biofuel bioethanol production. In most cases however reductions in lignin content are accompanied by presumably unintended pleiotropic consequences i.e. such as stunted growth of the resulting phenotypes Patten et al. 2005 Laskar et al. 2006 and or in weakened vasculature weakened stem strengths see Anterola and Lewis 2002 for examples . Such effects serve to remind that the general understanding of the physiology and metabolism of plants particularly as regards formation of various lignified and unlignified cell wall types is still severely lacking for example see Davin and Lewis 2005 .

One of the species of current agronomic interest is alfalfa L. a major forage crop of high nutritional feed value with an important role in soil nitrogen recycling. In this study therefore we examined the effects of modulation of p coumarate 3 hydroxylase pC3H gene expression in this species in terms of not only lignin deposition but also the effects on overall stem vasculature properties and architecture. This enzymatic step was discovered by Heller and K hnl 1985 using parsley cell suspension cultures with p coumaryl shikimate being its substrate and not p coumaric acid B . The encoding gene in was later described by Schoch et al. 2001 .

In this Example applicants disclose that formation of reaction tension tissue occurs in wild type WT alfalfa designated WT C 1 and whose amounts have also apparently increased in the pC3H down regulated line e.g. pC3H I as did the overall xylem volume. Yet in spite of the greatly reduced lignin content 64 there were apparently no significant differences between both lines in terms of material strength properties i.e. as shown by tensile dynamic modulus testing of young developing alfalfa branches. It is thus proposed that formation of reaction tissue may be increased in alfalfa and other angiosperms when the overall vasculature is weakened through reducing lignin content s . This can then serve as a compensatory mechanism in order to attempt to maintain needed biophysical biomechanical properties of the overall vasculature which would otherwise be weakened.

Plant tissue. Transgenic alfalfa lines were generated by Reddy et al. 2005 with samples of all alfalfa L. lines WT control WT C 1 and pC3H down regulated transgenic lines maintained and vegetatively propagated in Washington State University greenhouses. Growing conditions included a light intensity of 150 mmol mswith a 15 h light 9 h dark cycle at 21 and 16 C. respectively and a humidity range of 20 to 35 . Young 4 years of age black cottonwood trees ssp. Torr. et A. Gray Brayshaw were grown outdoors on the Washington State University campus with branches of 1 cm in diameter collected for microscopy analyses.

Lignin analyses. Acetyl bromide and thioacidolysis analyses were carried out as described in Patten et al. 2005 using 3 or more vegetatively propagated plants per line.

Dynamic mechanical analyses modulus of elasticity . For each WT C 1 and pC3H I alfalfa line following 3 weeks of growth after cut back 3 branches were collected each from individual plants. Internodes 2 5 and 8 numbered starting from the apical end of the branch were individually sampled at 25 mm in length. Specimens of internode segments were tested in the tension mode using a TRITEC 2000 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer Triton Technology Ltd. Nottinghamshire UK . The specimen free length was 10 mm and the diameter ranged from 1 to 1.7 mm. The test consisted of a dynamic strain sweep in the linear viscoelastic range from 0.003 to 0.03 performed at a frequency of 0.5 Hz and at a constant temperature of 30 1 C. To evaluate significant differences in dynamic moduli the storage E and loss E modulus of each sample was recorded at a 0.02 strain level and the data compared with a paired t test.

Growth measurements. Alfalfa WT C 1 and pC3H I lines were used for statistical analyses where each line had 2 plants with 8 weeks of growth after cut back. All plants within each alfalfa line were vegetatively derived from self stock. Branches not individual plants were chosen as the experimental unit because they represent the greatest variability within these lines as well as comprising the key component of aerial growth in alfalfa in general. Thus sampling was made collectively from plants within a given line with a total of ten crown bud derived branches N 10 sampled from each of the WT C 1 and pC3H I lines. Since alfalfa branch growth is rapid and pC3H I lags in flower development by at least 5 weeks relative to WT C 1 see also Reddy et al. 2005 branches at an equivalent maturity 8 weeks were selected based on the presence of flower buds flowers so as to avoid young or axillary branches less than 8 weeks of age. The number of internodes stem regions between leaves and the lengths of each internode were next recorded with hand cut sections being immediately harvested. Total stem lengths individual internode lengths and numbers of internodes were recorded with means and standard errors SE calculated and analyzed by t test 0.05 using Microsoft Excel software.

Lignin histochemistry. For lignin visualization sections were hand cut from internodes 2 3 and 8 of 3 week old branches of both WT C 1 and pC3H I lines. Wiesner reagent phloroglucinol HCl was employed to detect lignin in general whereas the M ule reagent was used to localize S lignin Patten et al. 2005 .

Gelatinous fiber histochemistry. For gelatinous fiber gf visualization zinc chloro iodide Herzberg reagent Scurfield 1972 Grzeskowiak et al. 1996 was employed. For imaging at lower magnifications fresh hand cut sections from internode IN 2 to the most basal internode plants 8 weeks of age were imaged within 20 minutes of reagent application. Gelatinous layers within fibers were identified by a red purple coloration in contrast to the orange brown coloration of surrounding and presumably lignified fiber cell walls after Scurfield 1972 .

Additionally zinc chloro iodide was used as part of a comparative study i.e. with a single mature internode IN20 from both lines as well as from a branch of black cottonwood. Safranin O and astra blue staining Srebotnik and Messner 1994 Vazquez Cooz and Meyer 2002 were also utilized to confirm further the zinc chloro iodide visualization results as well as phloroglucinol HCl to correlate with lignification described above . The comparative study employed serial cryosections 10 microns in thickness obtained from fresh frozen tissues cut on a Reichert Jung Cryocut 1800 cryomicrotome Leica Microsystems Deerfield Ill. USA . Light micrographs were recorded using an Olympus BH 2 light microscope equipped with a ProgRes C12plus digital camera JENOPTIK Jena Germany .

Gelatinous fiber occurrence and distribution. Hand cut internodal IN sections 475 sections were prepared from IN2 to the most basal internode of each branch N 10 for each alfalfa line as for growth measurements . These were then scored for the presence of gelatinous fibers gf and non gelatinous thick walled fibers tf respectively in primary and secondary reaction tissues using zinc chloro iodide for visualization Scurfield 1972 see histochemistry section . The sections 1000 were imaged in detail at several magnifications using light microscopy as described above. Following scoring for the presence of xylary gf or tf cells the respective means were statistically analyzed by Students t testing. Images of sections from IN5 i.e. earliest internode found to have gf cells in either line to the most basal internode of each branch 10 branches per line were individually measured for total xylem and total gf cell areas using ImageJ software Rasband 1997 with respective values also compared statistically by Students t testing. The extent of tf cell formation was not examined because it was not possible to resolve tf from normal fiber cells at the low magnification required to accurately measure area zinc chloro iodide and safranin O astra blue staining do not differentiate between tf and normal fiber cells.

Cell wall ultrastructure. Identification of reaction vs. normal cell types was further confirmed using transmission electron microscopy TEM . Samples were harvested from a mature internode IN20 from both WT C 1 and pC3H I lines as well as from branch tissue of black cottonwood as a control. Tissues 5 mm were fixed in 2 paraformaldehyde and 1.25 glutaraldehyde in 50 mm Pipes buffer pH 7.2 overnight at 4 C. Samples were dehydrated using a standard ethanol series gradually infiltrated with L.R. White resin London Resin Co. Reading UK and heat cured. Thin sections were obtained using a diamond knife mounted to a Reichert Ultracut R ultramicrotome Reichert Jung GmbH Heidelberg Germany with sections then mounted on formvar coated 200 mesh nickel grids. Sections were stained with a 3 1 dilution of 4 w v uranyl acetate and 1 w v KMnO with samples observed at 100 kV using a JEOL JEM 1200 EX transmission electron microscope JEOL Tokyo Japan .

Measurement of branch growth internode elongation. Branches N 10 were measured following 8 weeks of growth after cut back. No significant difference was found p 0.05 between the total stem lengths and total numbers of internodes for the two alfalfa lines TABLE 3 and total internode IN numbers higher in pC3H I than in WT C 1. In turn the mean internode length for pC3H I was significantly shorter p

Lignin deposition patterns. Plants aged 3 weeks following cut back were sampled from both lines with samples representing 3 stages of growth early primary xylem development with no interfascicular fiber development IN2 development of primary interfascicular fibers IN3 and secondary growth IN8 respectively. Chemical analyses TABLE 4 included both estimations of acetyl bromide AcBr lignin contents and monomeric H G S compositions as determined by thioacidolysis degradation described in Patten et al. 2005 . Histochemical analyses employed hand cut sections treated with either Wiesner or M ule reagent in order to localize patterns of presumed lignin deposition Patten et al. 2005 . Historically the Wiesner reagent phloroglucinol HCl is employed as a general stain pink to red coloration to detect p hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde end groups in macromolecular lignin of plant tissues. Although frequently referenced as coniferyl aldehyde specific e.g. by Sarkanen and Ludwig 1971 the reagent reacts with all three p hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes Pomar et al. 2002 Jourdes et al. 2007a . By contrast the M ule reagent is considered specific and is employed to differentiate between apparent S moieties from the H and G components red vs. brown coloration respectively Iiyama and Pant 1988 Nakano and Meshitsuka 1992 Patten et al. 2005 . Since both reagents give only temporary visualization of color images were recorded within 20 minutes of reagent application.

WT alfalfa lignin analyses. Histochemical analyses indicated that the earliest phase of lignification IN2 occurred in the primary xylem px of the WT C 1 line. It is apparently limited to either H and or H G lignin deposition as suggested by Wiesner pink red coloration and M ule golden brown coloration reagents respectively. This is supported by the lignin chemical analyses which gave an overall estimated content of 8.7 lignin largely of G character with smaller amounts of H and S moieties H G S ratio of 10 107 22 TABLE 4. Slightly later in development of the WT C 1 vascular tissue IN3 the cambium ca has formed a contiguous circumferential band of cells and lignification has apparently extended throughout the pr i.e. primary medullary or interfascicular ray tissue and is initiated in the phloem fibers pf phloroglucinol HCl red coloration . This phase of lignification now also apparently involves some detectable S lignin deposition in at least the pr M ule reagent light to dark red coloration . Again this is supported by the chemical analyses which indicated the overall lignin content had essentially doubled to 17 with the S content increased about 5 fold overall and with an H G S ratio of 10 110 42.

With further development IN8 the WT C 1 line extends its lignification throughout the pr sxr and pf cells as well as being very faintly stained in the pith pi phloroglucinol HCl red coloration . Using differential M ule staining the xylem cells of both the pr and the sxr appeared to contain H and or H G moieties brown coloration while fiber cells of pr sxr and pf apparently also had S containing lignins dark red coloration . This interpretation was supported further by chemical analyses with overall lignin amounts 26.1 now being close to those of maturation levels and where the H G S ratio 10 229 104 was mainly indicative of differential increases in G and S deposition TABLE 4 .

pC3H I alfalfa lignin analyses. Lignification of px in IN2 of pC3H I was again mainly of H or H G type character as visualized by use of phloroglucinol HCl pink red coloration but not of S since the M ule reaction staining gave a brown rather than red coloration . This interpretation was also supported by chemical analyses which indicated a slightly lower AcBr lignin content of 5.5 vs. 8.7 in WT C 1 Table 2 . Moreover the presumably H lignin derived releasable monomeric moieties were only slightly increased relative to WT C 1 whereas the G S amounts had decreased by at least an order of magnitude H G S ratio of 10 6 0.5 . Taken together these observations appear thus to be in harmony with the initial phase of H lignin deposition being generally unaffected by pC3H down regulation as anticipated Anterola and Lewis 2002 . Deposition of S lignin within the pr of IN3 occurs as in WT C 1 M ule reagent light red coloration and H respectively and corresponds well to the chemical analyses with lignin contents having increased slightly 7.1 with an H G S ratio now of 10 4.3 1.2 TABLE 4 .

At IN8 and like WT C 1 the transgenic line displayed an apparently uniform deposition of H and or H G lignins in the pr sxr and pf as well as a faint staining again in the pi as indicated by positive Wiesner reagent staining. However the M ule reagent only gave intense S lignin staining in the pr cell walls as evidenced by the distinctive red band adjacent to the pi which had been initiated previously . By comparison a lighter and more uneven coloration of the sxr occurred this being interpreted as indicative of a very limited S lignin deposition. The pi also appeared to have a similar pattern of faint staining relative to that of WT C 1. Chemical analyses in turn indicated that the lignin contents were now 9.4 thereby reflecting a very large decrease in overall lignin amount when compared to WT C 1 levels 26. 1 TABLE 4 . Likewise thioacidolysis analyses again established that while the H monomeric component dominated there were however small increases in both G and S contents as well H G S ratio of 10 3.5 1.8 . These data when taken together demonstrate that pC3H I is nevertheless forming small amounts of a primarily H type lignin during growth development.

Estimation of alfalfa branch tensile dynamic moduli. The tensile dynamic moduli storage and loss moduli were determined for both lines. The storage and loss moduli represent the elastic and viscous components of the material properties respectively and as such provide a measure of viscoelastic behavior. Branch internodes were harvested at 3 weeks post cut back with these representing early primary xylem development with little to no fiber development IN2 where internode elongation is thought to end and secondary growth begins IN5 Vallet et al. 1998 and where there is a large volume of lignified secondary xylem growth IN8.

Dynamic moduli determinations were thus made in triplicate for each internode of both lines and with reasonably good reproducibility see for example using p C3H I . That is there was a marked increase observed in storage E and loss E moduli with internode development maturation for both lines indicative of enhanced material properties . Upon Students t test comparison of data collected p values 0.267 0.116 and 0.810 for internodes 2 5 and 8 respectively however no significant difference in the storage modulus E was detected between lines WT C 1 and pC3H I. Similarly no significant difference in the loss modulus E was detected between both lines p values 0.979 and 0.225 for internodes 2 and 8 respectively except for internode 5 p value 0.006 . Apparently at internode 5 the pC3H I branch material has a higher loss modulus than that of WT C 1 but whether this particular difference is an artifact resulting from the small number of replicates or is a significant difference was not investigated further. In any case the overall data suggested that despite a range in lignin reduction i.e. 37 to 64 in IN2 and IN8 respectively relative to WT C 1 levels the pC3H I line was capable of maintaining comparable storage and loss tensile modulus properties to that of WT values. As described below an explanation for these observations was then needed to be identified rationalized.

Reaction tissue histochemistry. Zinc chloro iodide is one of several reagents used to detect reaction tissue Scurfield 1972 and was employed as the primary histochemical stain in this study. This dye can yield variable results because it does not react directly with cell wall bound molecules such as aldehydes in the manner of phloroglucinol HCL or the M ule reagent but instead intercalates into the cell wall which can vary in structure and therefore differentially exclude the dye Grzeskowiak et al. 1996 . This is especially true of transitional cells which may have variable numbers of secondary cell walls and which were also previously observed to have quite variable histochemical properties when stained with zinc chloro iodide Scurfield 1972 Grzeskowiak et al. 1996 . As such Scurfield 1972 generally described the G layer of ssp. as having a purple red coloration with surrounding walls colored yellow while the general coloration of transitional cells appeared yellowish red albeit with variability in coloration corresponding to variable cell structure. Grzeskowiak et al. 1996 also observed a red purple coloration in the G layers of with the normal cells being yellow. Applicants followed these observations for our interpretation of staining alfalfa reaction tissues.

Using hand cut internodal sections made from ten branches of both lines three interesting observations were made following zinc chloro iodide staining . First many of the sections examined stained positively for gelatinous fiber gf presence as noted in E and G for IN5 and 7 with this being even more pronounced in older internodes e.g. IN20 D . Secondly the branch tissues could be visually separated into xylary tissues having either red purple stained gf or tissues which stained yellow to orange and lacked gf cells normal transitional tissues . Thirdly both plant lines formed thick walled fibers tf which were physically similar to gf cells but stained entirely orange to yellow and were restricted to secondary growth see and J M .

Primary and secondary reaction tissues. Using the zinc chloro iodide reagent the presence or absence of xylary gf cells could be resolved by internode and by tissue type primary vs. secondary with the respective calculated means and standard errors compared by Students t test. As the reaction response has been reported to occur earlier in phloem than in xylem Scurfield and Wardrop 1962 the detection of presumed reaction phloem fibers rpf cells Scurfield and Wardrop 1962 Wardrop 1964 C t et al. 1969 allowed for facile identification of reaction tissue in even the youngest internodes lacking gf cells for example IN5 in WT C 1 vs. B for rpf vs. normal pf respectively . Additionally xylem region gf cells were found to occur significantly p

Primary and secondary transitional and normal tissues. Fiber cells f of the normal primary tissues of both lines appeared yellow to orange and lacked any detectable G layers proper i.e. red purple in color D F and H . It should be noted that while gf cells were absent the primary ray tissue in the early internodes i.e. IN3 5 of both lines still stained a uniform red to orange for example see pr of IN5 WT C 1 B . This primary ray coloration is likely due to the low lignin contents of the early internodes and was scored as a negative unless obvious gf cells were present.

Presumed transitional tissues frequently occurred in which gf cells had a typical dark inner layer and light yellow outer layers gf in sr . Transitional tissues are known to be highly variable Scurfield and Wardrop 1963 and may include tf cells as well.

Moreover thick walled fibers tf were considered here to comprise transitional tissues in alfalfa due to their swollen inner walls similar to gf cells but stained orange to yellow as in normal tissues . Additionally formation of tf cells occurs first in close proximity to gf cells proper and then extends further around the stem with internode maturity. Interestingly scoring of tf cells showed the greatest differential p

Comparisons of reaction versus lignin histochemistry. Serial sections were obtained from mature reaction and normal tissues IN20 of both alfalfa lines and from reaction and normal branch tissue of black cottonwood ssp. . The latter was used as a positive control since cottonwoods are well known to form gf cells Kaeiser and Boyce 1965 C t et al. 1969 Isebrands and Bensend 1972 .

G layer. Upon staining with zinc chloro iodide the G layers within gf cells in cottonwood were readily observed as red brown in color amid a background of orange cell walls as well as in IN20 of the WT C 1 and pC3H I lines. These results were further confirmed by the use of safranin O and astra blue staining. Using this approach the G layers appeared blue against a pink red background in all samples examined E H . Lignin was next localized in the serial sections by use of phloroglucinol HCl as before to compare with the above observations and was detected as a pale pink color since thin 10 m serial sections were used. In all samples and as expected there was little to no pink coloration in the G layer indicating little to no lignin being present F I . By contrast the surrounding cell walls appeared faint pink in color indicative of the presence of lignified elements.

Transitional and normal tissues. Interestingly a few gf cells observed in cottonwood and the WT C 1 line inset displayed a thin orange coloration internal to the G layer almost like an inner membrane G . Similar cells G were also observed in older internodes IN20 in sections from the pC3H I line data not shown and are believed to represent part of the transitional tissue.

On the other hand thick walled fibers tf in the case of both alfalfa lines appear to have histochemistry closer to normal cells than to the G. These were therefore compared in serial section to normal fibers f of cottonwood. In the alfalfa tf and the cottonwood f G layers of reaction wood proper were considered to be absent as evidenced by the lack of a red to purple brown coloration using zinc chloro iodide staining M P or characteristic blue cell wall layers by safranin O and astra blue double staining N Q . There was however a small amount of blue coloration around the lumens of the tf in the pC3H I line which provisionally may reflect either decreased lignification or a minor artifact of double staining. In any case there were no G layers as in reaction wood proper observable in the tf of this line or in the other samples. Finally phloroglucinol HCl histochemistry was found to be similar among all plant samples with tf wherein pink coloration indicative of lignification was present throughout the cell walls O R .

Quantification of xylem and xylem reaction tissue areas. Images of the sections above were digitally measured using ImageJ software as described in the Materials and Methods. Images of internodes 2 to 4 were excluded since they generally lack gf cells. It was calculated that the pC3H I line formed significantly p

Cell wall ultrastructure. Samples were collected as for the comparative histochemical analyses using both alfalfa and black cottonwood but processed for TEM analyses. Three cell types gelatinous fibers gf normal fibers f and vessels v were compared to each other and among plant lines .

Gelatinous fibers. The data so obtained with these sections correlated very well with previous reports on ultrastructure of gf cells. For cottonwood gf cells it was readily possible to observe relatively thin Sand Ssecondary layers along with the characteristic thick G layer . Likewise gf cells in both the WT C 1 and pC3H I lines were constructed of the same number and type of cell wall layers S S and G with the G layer appearing thickest as noted above for cottonwood. Moreover the characteristically uneven inner warty layer after Isebrands and Bensend 1972 was also clearly visible in each line species examined black arrowheads D F .

It should be noted however that the thickness of the G layer was variable even among adjacent fiber cells within each plant line and species examined data not shown in agreement with previous reports of such variability C t et al. 1969 Isebrands and Bensend 1972 . Furthermore all three samples displayed the characteristic preparation artifacts of G layers involving a slight detachment from the Ssubwall layer double arrowheads and tissue folding upon interaction with grid coating seen as a black line in the G layer D F such artifacts related to G layer analysis have been reported on numerous occasions C t et al. 1969 Clair et al. 2005 .

 Normal fibers. By contrast the normal tissue fibers f of all plant lines species examined had the expected 3 secondary subwall layers S S and S G which were also of variable thickness. A thick walled fiber to cell is also clearly visible in the WT C 1 .

Vessels. Finally vessel elements were imaged from the same sections grids to confirm that secondary tissue was examined and to compare with fiber cells for cell wall structure. The vessels v in all lines species displayed the expected secondary cell wall architecture including 3 lignified subwall layers S S S v E H . Additionally the vessels stained more intensely than the fiber cell walls especially in S presumably due to differential lignin content compositions of these cell wall types for example see .

Other general characteristics of reaction tissue in alfalfa. Besides the gf proper which may or may not be present in some species other characteristics of reaction wood were considered.

Spiral patterning of reaction tissue. It was noted that older branch internodes e.g. IN12 of both alfalfa lines also contained reaction tissue that occurred in spiral banded patterns data not shown . These patterns extended to being nearly circumferential in the woody crown tissue of both lines. Such patterns are likely related to the rapid growth and the subsequent tensile stress gradient thus generated around the stems in both lines during growth and development with more stresses experienced perceived by the pC3H down regulated line due to its reduced lignin content. Spiral reaction wood patterns have also been observed for saplings and rapidly growing trees reviewed in Barnett and Jeronimidis 2003 .

Variable eccentric growth. Since eccentric growth i.e. larger radius is frequently found on the upper side tension wood of branches of tree species Wardrop 1964 it was instructive to ascertain if similar histology occurred in alfalfa branches. Interestingly while some branch samples displayed a larger radius where gf cells occurred others either lacked eccentric growth but had reaction tissue or had elongated eccentric growth that only somewhat correlated to spiral patterned reaction tissue data not shown . Given the variability noted however with the data obtained eccentric growth was considered to be an unreliable character of reaction tissue in alfalfa. This is consistent with previous observations that herbaceous species do not usually form eccentric growth in relation to reaction tissue Wardrop 1964 .

pC3H is involved in regulation of carbon flux into the G and S segments during macromolecular lignin assembly Anterola and Lewis 2002 Anterola et al. 2002 . Reduction of pC3H activity would thus be expected to result in formation of a lignin reduced phenotype albeit largely derived from p hydroxycinnamyl alcohol H moieties. This is because it is very well documented that the H phase of lignification precedes deposition of both G and S moieties Fergus and Goring 1970a b Whiting and Goring 1982 Terashima and Fukushima 1988 Fukushima and Terashima 1991 . Indeed as expected the net effect of down regulating or mutating pC3H in results in a depleted lignin phenotype 64 lignin reduction relative to WT at maturation Jourdes et al. 2007a and largely containing H units. However this plant line was also severely dwarfed due to unknown pleiotropic effects and its vascular apparatus was greatly impaired Jourdes et al. 2007a see also Franke et al. 2002 .

In the case of alfalfa 11 lines down regulated in pC3H activity were generated of which line pC3H I was selected for further study as it had overall the lowest lignin content 9.4 relative to that of WT WT C 1 26.1 i.e. corresponding to a circa 64 reduction in lignin amounts. Moreover pC3H I predictably had greatly reduced S G levels in the lignin formed such that the lignin was mainly of H character. It is likely that the effects of this genetic manipulation which resulted in reduced carbon flux altered lignin composition reduced lignin content are continually perceived and responded to during pC3H I growth development i.e. ultimately resulting in global gene expression changes. That is lacking an ability to preferentially form vascular tissues with normal lignin content composition as for the WT C 1 line the pC3H I stem vascular apparatus developmental processes were altered. In fact relative to WT C 1 the pC3H I line displayed delayed flowering by 5 weeks .

Differential patterns of internode elongation. Alfalfa internode length and tissue development is highly variable Engels and Jung 1998 and as such 10 branches per line were sampled to allow for statistical comparisons. It was thus found that the average internode length among sampled branches of pC3H I was shorter than that of WT C 1 TABLE 3 . Since internode elongation is a feature of primary and not secondary growth it follows that pC3H I begins secondary growth earlier than WT C I. This may in part account for why pC3H I forms gf and tf cells earlier than WT C 1 and also forms more xylem tissue and xylem reaction tissues with gf cells . Interestingly early cessation of internode elongation is well documented in numerous angiosperm species in response to mechanical challenges such as controlled bending shaking or brushing Mitchell 1996 Garner and Bj rkman 1997 1999 Coutand and Moulia 2000 Coutand et al. 2000 . Perhaps this apparent reduction in internodal elongation is also induced by perception of potential weakening of the overall vascular apparatus through the reduction in lignin content.

Differential patterns of lignin deposition. One noteworthy difference in histochemical staining for lignin was found between the alfalfa lines and suggested that reduction of lignin content in pC3H I was more specific to secondary growth .

While the reasons for the apparent qualitative histochemical differences in S lignin deposition between the pr pf and the sxr region of pC3H I remain to be established one possibility is that deposition is differentially regulated between primary and secondary growth in alfalfa. It is well known that the deposition of specific lignin types is regulated both spatially i.e. by tissue cell and cell wall type and temporally e.g. in the order HG in xylem vessels HGS in angiosperm fibers . On the other hand we have not ruled out the possibility that observed differences in patterns of lignin deposition may be due to specific promoter artifact effects introduced by use of the heterologous pal2 bean promoter. These observations thus again underscore the complexity of studying lignification proper in planta.

Material properties of alfalfa. In terms of physiological function reaction tension woody tissue formation provides a mechanism to respond to changes in perceived longitudinal stress see Pilate et al. 2004 i.e. via formation of G layers within the gf which apparently lack lignin Norberg and Meier 1966 C t et al. 1969 . These include structural stresses such as axial displacement bending Wardrop 1964 Scurfield 1973 Barnett and Jeronimidis 2003 internal axial stresses i.e. rapidly growing upright stems Isebrands and Bensend 1972 Fisher and Stevenson 1981 Barnett and Jeronimidis 2003 as well as those introduced by the twining habit of some vines Meloche and Vaughn 2006 . Given the mechanical support provided by this tissue type angiosperm reaction tissues are also known to be cellulose rich lignin deficient.

Interestingly numerous genetically modified plant lines altered in lignin content composition have been shown to possess weaker stems and a weaker vascular integrity than the corresponding WT lines reviewed by Anterola and Lewis 2002 . For instance a transgenic tobacco line down regulated in cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase CAD activity had a lower longitudinal tensile modulus than WT Hepworth and Vincent 1998 . Additionally a double mutation knockout of CAD genes in resulted in an extensively depleted lignin phenotype with a tendency for the stems to become prostrate Sibout et al. 2005 Jourdes et al. 2007b . The stem sections however were also significantly reduced in storage tensile modulus Jourdes et al. 2007b in keeping with the observed phenotype.

Thus the comparable tensile dynamic moduli observed for both WT and the pC3H I down regulated line suggests that a compensatory mechanism is in effect to attempt to maintain the needed structural properties. That is the increased formation of gf and tf cells in the pC3H I line may in part compensate for the decreased lignin contents and thus in offsetting decreased structural support vascular integrity which would otherwise result. However any correlation such as being proposed herein will require detailed analyses of various lines containing different amounts of lignin i.e. intermediary between WT and the pC3H I line to establish what correlations with anatomical changes can be made.

Reaction tissue. Woody plants have a mechanism for controlling both branch orientation and restoration of vertical alignment when stems are displaced from the normal vertical alignment. In both gymnosperms and angiosperms this mechanism leads to formation of various tissues collectively referred to as reaction wood and which are frequently separated from normal wood by so called transitional wood with intermediate characteristics . In gymnosperms reaction tissue is termed compression wood and contains an increased H lignin content Timell 1986 Fukushima and Terashima 1991 . While this has often been considered to result from differences in gravity perception i.e. via signaling and transduction this process can be duplicated in microgravity through mechanical bending Kwon et al. 2001 . It is poorly understood though how these stress signals are perceived and how the signal cascade is transduced leading to reaction tissue formation.

Woody angiosperms have a quite distinct but somewhat complementary mechanism leading to another form of reaction tissue known as tension wood. In general it is characterized by much lower lignin contents as well as reduced numbers and diameter of vessel elements present Wardrop 1964 Kucera and Philipson 1977 . However other characteristics of woody angiosperm reaction tissue are highly variable including whether gelatinous fibers gf and or eccentric growth patterns due to differing radii between upper and lower sides of the branch occur Wardrop 1964 Kucera and Philipson 1977 Nevertheless the gf cell type has frequently been used as a diagnostic character of tension wood and is distinguished by a gelatinous G layer which has a gel like appearance under magnification and often replaces one or more subwall layers of the fiber secondary cell wall Wardrop 1964 Carlquist 2001 . Furthermore the higher tensile strength and Young s modulus found in tension wood relative to normal wood Barnett and Jeronimidis 2003 Clair et al. 2003 is thought to be partly due to the high tensile strength generated by orientation of the cellulose microfibrils within the G layer Yamamoto et al. 1993 Prodhan et al. 1995 . It should also be noted that at least three fiber cell types tracheids fiber tracheids and libriform fibers occur in dicotyledons and which can form G layers under tensile stress Carlquist 2001 .

Reaction tissue identification and differential formation in alfalfa. Gelatinous fibers proper were found to stain red purple using zinc chloro iodide in both alfalfa lines as compared to cottonwood reaction tissue in this study and as described in previous studies of reaction wood in trees Scurfield 1972 Grzeskowiak et al. 1996 . Applicants confirmed the presence of gf cells in alfalfa in the same way using safranin O astra blue and then by comparison of cell wall ultrastructure to known gf cells of tree species.

With positive identification of reaction tissue in alfalfa WT C 1 and the pC3H I lines we sought to determine whether reaction tissue formation in the pC3H I was more extensive than that of WT C 1 possibly allowing pC3H I to compensate for lost mechanical strength following lignin down regulation. Results showed that initiation of gf formation in pC3H I begins on average two internodes earlier than WT C 1 and is possibly related to an apparently earlier cessation of internode elongation earlier secondary growth in the pC3H I. Additionally the pC3H I was shown to form more total xylem area and more total reaction xylem area than the WT C 1. These data may help in part explain the phenomenological observation of Reddy et al. 2005 that pC3H down regulated alfalfa lines appeared to produce higher amounts of cellulose. It is still not clear whether increased reaction tissue formation in pC3H I is a sole and direct effect of reduced lignin contents or if there are additional effects resulting from genetic manipulation. Future work will address this issue using other transgenic pC3H down regulated alfalfa lines as indicated above.

Transitional tissue identification and differential formation in alfalfa. Besides gf cells proper small groups of similar cells with an inner membrane G were observed in tissue of both alfalfa lines and cottonwood. Fibers with a similar inner membrane have been previously reported and proposed to be lignified Scurfield and Wardrop 1963 Scurfield 1972 Joseleau et al. 2004 Gierlinger and Schwanninger 2006 . However Applicants were not able to confirm lignification of this inner layer by phloroglucinol HCl staining. Furthermore while it was noted that the occurrence of Gwas generally uncommon in both alfalfa lines and the cottonwood sample the number of Gcells increased as alfalfa tissues became more woody. Such cell types G may be related to transitional tissue i.e. between reaction and normal tissue Scurfield and Wardrop 1963 .

Additionally we observed thick walled fibers tf directly in contact with gf cells proper as well as developing later throughout the areas of stems lacking gf cells proper . The tf cells had a physical appearance similar to the swollen irregularly shaped gf cells but showing variable staining orange to yellow by zinc chloro iodide perhaps indicating a cell wall chemistry intermediate to that of reaction tissue predominately red purple and normal tissue yellow . These cells seem to correspond with Scurfield s 1972 reports of transitional tissue staining variably with zinc chloro iodide. He reasoned that the histochemical variability was probably due to the variable ultrastructure of such transitional fibers which had variable numbers of secondary cell walls in addition to a G layer of variable width. Interestingly preliminary descriptions of xylary tf cells have been reported by Vallet et al. 1996 and Engels and Jung 1998 but without comment on their physiological roles or prevalence. It is very likely that the tf cells comprise transitional tissues but it is also recognized that the inner cell wall swelling of both gf and tf cells may be exaggerated due to artifact during sample preparation C t et al. 1969 Clair et al. 2005 .

Interestingly tf cell formation occurred on average seven intemodes later in WT C 1 than in the pC3H I. Although it was not possible to accurately calculate the area of tf cells see Materials and Methods the observation that this cell type occurs so much earlier in pC3H I indicates that tf cells transitional tissues are induced in the pC3H I at the same time as gf cells. Presumably WT C 1 possesses enough mechanical strength to support all but the most basal intemodes of the branch without if cell formation in addition to gf cells.

To Applicants knowledge this specification represents the first description of reaction tissue in this species even though the alfalfa growth habit itself suggests a capacity for its formation i.e. since woody alfalfa tissue is formed in the basal portion of the plant the crown in order to survive winter Undersander et al. 1997 and the developing branches elongate rapidly with variable displacement from a vertical alignment. Reaction tissue has however been reported in numerous woody members of the family Fabaceae to which alfalfa belongs Onaka 1949 Nehacek over c esan 1955 Wardrop 1964 H ster and Liese 1966 Fisher and Stevenson 1981 .

It can thus be provisionally anticipated that in many if not all lignin reduced woody gymnosperm and angiosperm plants the formation of reaction transitional wood is to be an expected consequence i.e. whereby the organism utilizes its pre existing mechanisms normally employed to reinforce branches and or leaning stems. In possible agreement with this several transgenic poplar trees down regulated for CAD activity downstream of pC3H were also suspected to have an apparently altered ability to form G layers although no data was reported Pilate et al. 2004 . If correct as predicted herein this would not be a preferred outcome for many forestry pulp and paper applications due to the deleterious properties of gelatinous fibers resulting in poor strength quality due to decreased bonding properties Dickison 2000 .

Nevertheless how these biochemical processes leading to reaction tissue formation are initiated including perception of the need for its formation and activation of the various biochemical pathways involved are very important questions that remain to be fully delineated. Indeed obtaining a detailed biochemical understanding of the factors controlling reaction wood formation in rapidly growing species such as fast growing trees and how this can be controlled is of obvious importance to the forestry industry e.g. in terms of developing approaches to obtain woody tissues of the desired quality for humanity s various needs.

Example summary. This Example relates to advances made by applicants and which result in formation of two well known molecules chavicol and eugenol. Both substances have historically been used as flavor fragrant components from Tanzania Madagascar and Indonesia however the biochemical biotechnological manipulations disclosed herein provide for the diversion of monolignols from lignin lignan formation in plant species to instead diverting these compounds for use for example in biodiesel or polymer production plastic replacement i.e. in addition to their current roles in human nutrition and medicine.

Example overview. Recognition of a growing national emergency has resulted from escalating costs of petroleum derived products worldwide political instability of petroleum producing regions throughout the world and an increasing recognition of an ever dwindling unsustainable supply of petroleum products for future generations. Coupled to an ever increasing human population and an ever increasing demand for petroleum products this has resulted in a growing awareness that humanity needs to urgently identify solutions to circumvent this serious problem in a sustainable reliable manner. These issues relate not only to fuels but also to producing sufficient quantities of petroleum based polymers such as polyethylenes polystyrenes and other products about 12 of all petroleum is used for non fuel non energy purposes.

A major potential sources of renewable energy biofuels is that from plant biomass i.e. through fermentation of polymeric carbohydrates to give ethanol. While the capacity of ethanol production in the USA has steadily grown over the last decade predominantly from partial fermentation of corn stem residues there are two major scientific hurdles that have not yet been overcome. The first is that of the polymeric lignins which make up ca. 20 30 of all plant stem biomass and which are Nature s second most abundant organic materials. Under current fermentation processes lignins cannot readily be converted into either ethanol and or other liquid gaseous fuels. Indeed there are still no isolated enzymes and or proteins known to effectively degrade the lignin macromolecules in contrast to reports in the nineteen eighties that indicated this problem had been solved. Secondly the polymeric lignins themselves represent a formidable physical barrier in biomass for efficient carbohydrate fermentation and thus their presence represents a critical barrier in making these technologies more economical.

There are therefore compelling reasons to identify novel ways to more effectively utilize the lignin biopolymers and or the carbon allocated for the lignin forming pathway.

Biotechnological manipulations of both lignin contents and compositions in various plant species have been successfully obtained but not without a price. Generally the effects of drastically reducing lignin contents in vascular plants results in significant impairment of the vascular apparatus the integrity of which is required for plants to withstand compressive forces and other environmental challenges e.g. wind rain snow etc. as well as for efficiently transporting nutrients and water. Such defects e.g. collapsed vessels etc. for a discussion and examples see Anterola and Lewis can potentially lead to serious difficulties in growing biotechnologically modified plant lines in the wild due to a compromised vascular apparatus i.e. as this can lead to premature lodging vasculature collapse of plant stems during growth development. Therefore prefereably an appropriate balance is maintained between growing vascular plants for commercial purposes and reducing modifying lignin content and or composition. However while the precise extent to which lignin polymer composition and content can ultimately be modified is yet to be fully appreicated there are according to particular aspects of the present invention alternative ways to produce renewable energy biofuels while striking an adequate balance between lignin content composition and sufficient structural integrity.

The present inventive methods could be applied for example either in oilseed bearing plants e.g. canola or in heartwood forming tissues of trees e.g. western red cedar used for lumber and pulp paper products. In the latter heartwood formation is generally accompanied by a massive deposition of non structural low molecular weight molecules such as the lignan plicatic acid 30 which in western red cedar can be 20 of the overall dry weight of the stem. These processes oilseed and heartwood formation deposition of metabolites as well as judicial modification of lignin content and composition thus offer the potential to rationally optimize plant feedstocks for biofuel bioenergy either directly in specific crops or indirectly as part of wood processing for pulp paper specialty chemicals etc.

As discussed herein lignins are biopolymeric materials derived from the one electron oxidation of monolignols p coumaryl 19 coniferyl 21 and sinapyl 23 alcohols whereas the lignans in heartwood tissues are low molecular weight metabolites derived from the same precursors. At ambient temperatures the precursor monolignols are relatively unstable and reactive solid compounds whereas the final lignin biopolymers are quite intractable biopolymers and the heartwood lignans are solids that can be extracted by aqueous organic mixtures. In general it requires strenuous chemical pulping conditions to solubilize the lignin derived material from woody plant cell walls i.e. via chemical pulping using either strong caustic or strong acid solutions at elevated temperatures and pressures. Lignin removal however is essential if effective fermentation of carbohydrate biomass is an objective.

Applicants have previously discovered a class of enzymes that we have depicted as pinoresinol lariciresinol and phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductases PLRs and PCBERs Chu et al. 268 27026 27033 Dinkova Kostova et al. 271 29473 29482 Fujita et al. 274 618 627 Gang et al. 274 7516 7527 Min T. et al. 278 50714 50723 the former convert monolignol derived dimers lignans into valuable medicinal products such as the cancer preventative compounds secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol. They also represent major intermediates to various heartwood accumulating lignans i.e. plicatic acid in trees such as western red cedar.

Presently a new but analogous pathway utilizing monolignols has been discovered which applicants consider has extraordinarily promising potential for either biofuels intermediate chemicals or as an improved and stable source of the spice chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 components. For example the latter is widely used in medical and dental applications due to its biocidal and analgesic properties. In the pathway to these two allylphenols the monolignol precursors are first biochemically activated via ester formation and then subsequently converted into the highly combustible liquid fuels the aromatic hydrocarbons chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 . Importantly the protein involved chavicol eugenol synthase CS ES is a homologue of our PLR PCBER proteins whose encoding cDNA hybridizes under the same conditions as for PLR. The proteins of interest are thus trivially depicted as bifunctional chavicol eugenol synthases.

According to particular aspects of the present invention this discovery provides novel methods for diverting monolignol flow away from lignin biopolymer formation or from heartwood lignan accumulation deposition to that engendering formation of the potential product liquid fuels intermediate chemicals of interest. In additional aspects this strategy enhances oilseed production as well both in relative amounts of bioproduct biofuels and their calorific value. In further aspects these products chavicol 31 eugenol 33 would be removed leaving the remaining lignin reduced biomass able to be more efficiently fermented for ethanol production.

Preferably two genes encoding respective proteins are used to provide proteins that can i acylate monolignol precursors to afford the corresponding acylated derivatives e.g. the acylating transferase family from Chau et al. 430 237 246 2004. and ii convert the latter into liquid biofuel intermediate chemicals e.g. using the presently disclosed novel CS ES homologues . Alternatively the monolignols can be chemically acylated followed by conversion by CS ES.

In particular aspects chavicol 31 eugenol 33 or isomers thereof are produced in bacterial and plant cell cultures. In certain embodiments and tobacco cell cultures are used to convert p coumaryl 19 and coniferyl 21 alcohols both lignin and lignan precursors into the allylphenols p chavicol b and eugenol 33 or the regioisomers p anol 37 and isoeugenol 39 . In the case of bacterial cell cultures transformed cells harboring the genes encoding the monolignol acyl transferase and the chavicol eugenol synthases CS ES are used.

Biotransformation of p coumaryl coniferyl alcohols in by heterologous expression of acyltransferase from sp and chavicol synthase or eugenol synthase. In particular aspects the genes encoding these two proteins are cloned into a coexpression vector such as the pET 30 Ek LIC vector offered by Novagen EMD Held et al. 18 3 6 Loomis et al. 15 2 6 and Novy R. et al. 15 2 6 which uses the LIC Duet Adapter method for simultaneous cloning of two open reading frames. This construct is expressed in an host strain compatible for coexpression such as BL21 DE3 . The substrate p coumaryl 19 coniferyl 21 alcohol is incubated with the transgenic coexpressing these two proteins and the end products are analyzed. Compounds resulting from monolignol metabolism are preferably analyzed by HPLC. Preferably an assay is first conducted to determine tolerance levels of towards monolignol acetate concentration. Eugenol 33 substrate conversion to ferulic acid 6 and vanillin has been previously studied successfully in an coexpression system Overhage et al. 69 6569 6576 2003 . Recombinant cells expressing a combination of plant biosynthetic genes have also been shown to efficiently convert phenylpropionic acids to stilbene compounds Watts et al. 6 22 2006 .

The obtained transformed cell lines are used to determine the optimal conditions e.g. pH temperature light intensity effects of varying IPGT concentrations cell culture induction growth and residence times of cell cultures cell culture viability product collection and optimization e.g. via decanting concentration on solid matrixes product stability etc. for conversion of p coumaryl 19 coniferyl 21 alcohol esters into acccumulated desired allylphenols such as chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 . In particular tobacco cell culture embodiments the tobacco cells are transformed with both genes under control of for example the 35S CaMV promoter to provide cells to accumulate chavicol 31 eugenol 33 and or convert p coumaryl 19 coniferyl 21 alcohols into these products respectively.

In additional aspects either oilseed e.g. rapeseed or heartwood forming plants are transformed genetically modified to produce in large quantity chavicol 31 and eugenol 33 . In certain embodiments allylphenol propenylphenol accumulation is engeineered in both tobacco and canola plant lines.

Tobacco transformation. In certain additional spects these two genes are cotransformed into to provide a modified biosynthetic expression system in planta. In certain embodiments expression of the heterologous proteins is driven by a tissue specific promoter such as the one associated with CAD activity Kim et al. 101 1455 1460 2004 . Tobacco plant cells are for example transformed using cocultivation using the appropriate methods for either leaf An et al. 81 301 305 1986 or callus Mayo et al. 1 1105 1111 2006 tissue. Briefly this protocol involves co cultivation of leaf pieces with for two days followed by transfer to shoot induction agar plates containing BA benzyladenine or callus induction medium containing NAA naphthaleneacetic acid and BA. A more detailed procedure for tobacco leaf transformation is as follows. Cell cultures will be obtained from the transformants following standard procedures.

General procedure used for tobacco plant transformation and regeneration. LBA4404 pC2760 are transformed with DNA plasmid preparations of each of the final constructs. Overnight cultures of these Agrobacteria are then grown in 2 ml YEP medium containing kanamycin 10 g ml glucose 0.4 and acetosyringone 50 M . Leaf pieces from 6 week old sterile tobacco plants of the wild type line growing in MS medium in Magenta boxes are placed upside down into 4 ml sterile MS medium containing 6 benzylaminopurine BA 0.5 g and naphthalene acetic acid NAA 2 g ml and placed in a dark 28 C. incubator. After 2 3 days the leaf pieces are washed off with MS medium containing the same BA and NAA concentrations and placed upside down onto 0.6 Phytagar MS plates containing BA 1.0 g ml and NAA 0.1 g ml and kanamycin 50 g ml carbenicillin 100 g ml and cefotaxime 200 g ml and the plates are placed under low light 50 mol conditions. It usually takes 4 8 weeks for shoots to become visible. After 4 8 weeks or as soon as shoots start to appear the shoots are picked and transferred to 0.4 Phytagar MS plates containing only sucrose 15 g l and BA 1.0 g ml and NAA 0.1 g ml with kanamycin 50 g ml carbenicillin 100 g ml and cefotaxime 200 g ml and the plates are put into stronger light 150 mol for shoot and root stimulation. After about two weeks on this medium the plantlets are then transferred to MS plates containing only sucrose 15 g l plus NAA 0.1 g ml with kanamycin 50 g ml carbenicillin 50 g ml and cefotaxime 200 g ml to encourage root formation. When roots start to appear the plants are transferred to Magenta squares containing sucrose 15 g l plus kanamycin 25 g ml carbenicillin 50 g ml and cefotaxime 200 g ml . When a strong root system develops and the plants are growing well they are transferred to pots containing potting medium. After hardening off for 1 2 weeks the plants are sent to the greenhouse to grow to maturity.

In certain aspects a tobacco line is directed towards increasing allylphenol formation in both leaf and stem tissues with the latter providing validation for heartwood deposition. In additional embodiments the canola line is directed engineered to oilseed metabolite accumulation.

In particular tobacco plant aspects in combination with introducing overexpressing the chavicol eugenol synthases and acyltransferases partial to full down regulation of lignification is acheived with increasing allyl propenyl phenol formation. In certain embodiments the plant lines are transformed under control of both 35S and native promoters e.g. using the monolignol pathway promoter for the last step to the monolignols cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase to provide for a allyl propenyl phenol formation b altered stem properties and c ease of fermentation of the remaining material to afford ethanol relative to wild type lines .

Canola transformation In additional aspects canola is transformed with the same constructs as described above using cocultivation procedures as outlined by Cardoza et al. Cardoza Stewart In . Curtis I. S. ed pp. 379 387 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers and Cardoza Stewart 21 599 604 2003 . Briefly hypocotyl segment explants are cocultivated with the harboring the binary vector constructs for two days washed off then placed onto a preconditioning MS medium containing the auxin hormone analog 2 4 D. After two weeks these hypocotyls explants are transferred to organogenesis promoting medium containing BAP 6 benzylaminopurine zeatin and silver nitrate. Two weeks later the shoots are transferred to a shoot development medium containing BAP and zeatin. The shoots are then transferred to shoot elongation medium containing BAP. Finally elongated shoots are transferred to rooting medium containing IBA.

In particular canola plant aspects allylphenol phenol is targeted to oilseed tissues to provide production yield s .

Example summary. This Example relates to the effects of disruption of lignin macromolecular configuration and stem vascular integrity through CAD mutations. With such mutations template polymerization was attempted but aborted at an early stage of cell wall phenolic deposition when p hydroxycinnamaldehydes were employed as substrates.

More specifically the lignin deficient double mutant of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase CAD cad 4 cad 5 or cad c cad d in Sibout et al. 2005 was comprehensively examined for effects on disruption of native lignin macromolecular configuration the two genes encode the catalytically most active CAD s for monolignol lignin formation Kim et al. 2004 . The inflorescence stems of the double mutant presented a prostrate phenotype with dynamic modulus properties greatly reduced relative to that of the wild type WT line due to severe reductions in macromolecular lignin content. Interestingly initially the overall pattern of phenolic deposition in the mutant was apparently very similar to WT indicative of comparable assembly processes attempting to be duplicated. However shortly into the stage involving monomer cleavable 8 O 4 linkage formation deposition was aborted. At this final stage the double mutant had retained a very limited ability to biosynthesize monolignols as evidenced by cleavage and release of ca 4 of the monolignol derived moieties relative to the lignin of the WT line. In addition while small amounts of cleavable p hydroxycinnamaldehyde derived moieties were released the overall frequency of monomer cleavable 8 O 4 inter unit linkages closely approximated that of WT for the equivalent level of lignin deposition in spite of the differences in monomer composition. Additionally 8 5 linked inter unit structures were clearly evident albeit as fully aromatized phenylcoumaran like substructures.

The data are interpreted as a small amount of p hydroxycinnamaldehydes being utilized in highly restricted attempts to preserve native lignin configuration i.e. through very limited monomer degeneracy during template polymerization which would otherwise afford lignins proper in the cell wall from their precursor monolignols. The defects introduced e.g. in the vascular integrity provide important insight as to why p hydroxycinnamaldehydes never evolved as lignin precursors in the 350 000 or so extant vascular plant species. Prior to investigating lignin primary structure proper it is instructive to initially define the fundamental characteristics of the biopolymer s being formed such as inter unit frequency and lignin content in order to design approaches to determine overall sequences of linkages.

Example overview. The compelling question of whether monolignol derived macromolecular lignin configuration results from either non random or random coupling is only now being fully addressed in terms of beginning to design definitive experiments and approaches to distinguish between such possibilities Davin Lewis 2005 . Yet this is a matter of profound importance whether considering lignin s potential for improved utilization of lignocellulosics for the wood pulp and paper industries or as a source of new biofuels biopolymers or ruminant feedstocks. Moreover establishing how macromolecular lignin configuration is actually engendered is also of fundamental importance for science itself particularly being Nature s second most abundant vascular plant substances next to cellulose Lewis and Yamamoto 1990 Lewis et al. 1999 Croteau et al. 2000 and Anterola Lewis 2002 .

Some reports have extended the fifty year old unproven random assembly hypothesis to now include the facile seamless incorporation of non lignin phenolic moieties into lignin biopolymers should monolignol 19 21 and 23 supply be diminished Ralph et al 1997 19998 and 2004a . Such instances have been proposed to occur when the monolignol pathway steps are either mutated or down regulated and have led to repeated suggestions of a compensatory combinatorial biochemistry random coupling mechanism being in effect using different non monolignol precursors Ralph et al 2004a . This in turn has led to other notions that lignin structure is not particularly important from either physiological and or structural perspectives Ralph et al 1997 as well as lignins being able to accommodate a remarkable level of plasticity in overall structure.

Recent studies of altering lignin deposition processes i.e. in terms of overall amounts and or differing monomeric compositions have continued without first establishing how lignin assembly macromolecular configuration proper is actually and definitively biochemically achieved. On the other hand our emerging knowledge of how lignification occurs at least in terms of modulating monolignol supply and composition has been comprehensively critiqued and re interpreted in terms of predictability from a non random assembly perspective Anterola Lewis 2002 . Regularity in lignin structure has also been proposed by several investigators Sarkanen et al. 1984 Garver et al. 1989 Banoub Delmas 2003 e.g. based upon physico chemical analysis of soluble lignin derivatives produced under alkaline kraft pulping conditions. Related studies have reported that following formation of lignin primary structure chain replication next occurs via a template polymerization process with incoming monolignols radicals being aligned prior to coupling through strong non covalent bond interactions on the preformed lignin macromolecule s Guan et al. 1997 Sarkanen 1998 Chen Sarkanen 2003 .

Yet in apparent support of the plasticity model for random combinatorial lignin macromolecular assembly examples of surrogate monomers reportedly included 2 methoxybenzaldehyde 76 feruloyl tyramine 78 as well as a range of other non monolignol moieties such as acetosyringone 77 and related phenolics Ralph et al 1997 Boudet 1998 . Such moieties were initially reported as being incorporated into lignins at substantial levels when plants were mutated down regulated in cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase CAD E.C. 1.1.1.195 and cinnamoyl CoA reductase CCR E.C. 1.2.1.44 Ralph et al 1998 . However there were no precise levels of quantification reported to gain needed insight into what substantial meant in terms of lignification. From first principles many of these moieties could not be anticipated to freely participate in a core free radical polymerization process other than in chain termination reactions for example.

The 2 methoxybenzaldehyde 76 report has since essentially been retracted Ralph et al 1998 . Moreover no evidence for feruloyl tyramine 78 serving as either a general biochemical signature for CCR downregulation mutation Chabannes et al. 2001 and or as being incorporated into lignin Ralph et al 1998 Chabannes et al. 2001 could be independently confirmed in our own studies of the CCR irx4 mutant Patten et al. 2005 Laskar et al. 2006 . Instead as could perhaps be anticipated only a delayed but coherent deposition pattern of lignification occurred due to the depletion in monolignol supply rate and or presumed attenuation of free CoASH levels in the lignifying cells Laskar et al. 2006 . Nor was any compelling evidence obtained for incorporation of other non monolignol phenolic moieties e.g. acetosyringone 77 and hydroxycinnamic acids 4 8 into the core macromolecular lignin framework as a result of CCR mutation. Instead the overall levels of these moieties in CCR down regulated tobacco lines apparently only accounted for 0.04 0.07 of the lignified cell wall residue CWR Anterola Lewis 2002 and would thus be of minor significance at best. Such moieties however were not observed in the lignin isolates from the CCR mutant at least down to the levels of NMR spectroscopic detection employed Laskar et al. 2006 . These data therefore place considerable restrictions on the proposed concept of lignin plasticity and seamless combinatorial biochemistry using surrogate monomers.

In this Example applicants have extended their analyses of the CAD multigene family in . This particular enzyme catalyzes the NADPH dependent substrate versatile reduction of various p hydroxycinnamaldehydes e.g. 14 18 into the corresponding p hydroxycinnamyl alcohols 19 23. From applicants previous studies Kim et al. 2004 it was demonstrated that two isoforms AtCAD5 and AtCAD4 had the highest CAD activities in vitro of 17 possible CAD gene members annotated and that these were thus the most likely dominant contributors to the CAD metabolic network involved in lignification. Moreover the recent generation of an cad 4 cad 5 cad c cad d double mutant Sibout et al. 2005 described herein as a CAD double mutant for simplicity further supported these conclusions. Indeed it has provided a convenient means for comprehensively studying the effects of knocking out both genes on the formation of the lignified vascular apparatus present in bolting stems. Applicants demonstrates that while small amounts of a poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde polymer were formed i.e. relative to lignin in the CAD double mutant the material strength properties dynamic moduli of the stem plant material were predictably greatly diminished i.e. weaker relative to wild type WT . This again underscored the evolutionary significance of having a monolignol derived lignin structure in both amounts and monomeric compositions to achieve normal physiological functions in intact plant stems. These observations further demonstrated why plant lignins are not poly p hydroxycinnamaldehydes i.e. from either a chemical structure or a physiological functional perspective. Similar conclusions have already been made upon analysis of other reports directed towards altering lignin amounts compositions see Anterola Lewis 2002 .

The present study also had as its specific objectives to comprehensively establish the effects of AtCAD4 5 double mutation on lignification proper. Accordingly various chemical degradation and chemical analyses procedures were developed for this purpose. The data so obtained however again underscored the progress made in terms of simply quantifying amounts of lignins and other phenolics as well as in determining inter unit linkage frequencies etc. That is the approaches developed herein have now enabled applicants to much more accurately determine the amounts as well as the nature of various inter unit structures and inter unit linkage frequencies within the relatively small amounts of the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde polymer s being formed i.e. by using criteria generally applied for characterization of all other plant natural products. Interestingly it was established that the frequencies of the cleavable 8 O 4 linkages leading to monomer release within this poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde corresponded closely to that observed for the equivalent amount of monolignol derived lignin deposition. Moreover evidence for the presence and nature of 8 5 linked substructures previously described as nearly undetectable by Kim et al. 2003 in related CAD deficient studies are also summarized. As discussed below the results are considered in terms of control over macromolecular lignin configuration and of a very limited monomer degeneracy during an ultimately aborted attempt of template guided polymerization.

Plant material and growth parameters. Seeds from cad 4 cad 5 double mutant lines were provided by Dr. A. S guin Natural Resources Canada Sainte Foy Qu bec Canada . Both wild type and CAD double mutant lines were grown in Washington State University greenhouses at 21 and 16 C. with a 15 h light 9 h dark cycle a light intensity of 150 mmol msand a humidity range from 20 to 35 . Both WT and CAD double mutant lines were independently evaluated for their main bolting stem growth and development parameters length and basal diameters these being measured weekly from 3.5 weeks growth development until 10 weeks using twenty randomly chosen plants harvest sampling point.

Histochemistry. Histochemical analyses employed Wiesner and M ule reagents for staining fresh hand cut stem cross sections of WT and CAD double mutant lines at 4 6 and 8 weeks growth development Patten et al. 2005 . Light micrographs were recorded using an Olympus BH 2 photomicroscope.

Cell wall residue CWR preparations. After removing leaves and secondary stems from the main bolting stems for each sample the extractive free cell wall residues CWR were prepared as previously described Patten et al. 2005 i.e. by successive extraction of individual samples at room temperature for 12 h each with EtOH toluene 1 1 v v 100 ml g EtOH 100 ml g and then twice with HO 100 ml g prior to subsequent chemical degradative analyses.

Lignin enriched isolates WT and poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde preparations. Extractive free CWR s 10 g from WT and CAD double mutant lines 8 wks old were individually subjected to a modified Bj rkman lignin isolation procedure as previously described Jourdes et al. manuscript in preparation to furnish a lignin enriched isolate from WT 210 mg and a poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde enriched preparation from the CAD double mutant 160 mg these isolates corresponded to 10.1 and 14.2 of the estimated AcBr UV absorbing constituents present in the original CWR s.

Lignin WT and poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde enriched cad 4 cad 5 isolates following cellulase digestion. Extractive free CWR s 8 g from both WT and CAD double mutant lines were individually ground by ball milling for 96 hr at 4 C. and then subjected to A. niger cellulase digestion prior to subsequent extraction as follows. The cellulase 472 units was first dissolved in NaOAc buffer 5 ml 20 mM pH 5.0 and centrifuged 7 200 g 10 min to remove insoluble impurities. The resulting supernatant was next added to each suspension of CWR 8 g in NaOAc buffer 45 ml 20 mM pH 5.0 and individually incubated for 48 h at 30 C. the whole cellulase digestion procedure was then repeated 3 times using fresh cellulase 472 units in NaOAc buffer. After a final digestion the resulting suspensions were individually centrifuged 7 200 g 10 min with the insoluble residues remaining washed with distilled HO 4 50 ml then frozen at 80 C. and freeze dried for 3 days to afford cellulase digested CWR preparations 3.38 g for the CAD double mutant and 3.85 g for WT . The cellulase digested CWR from WT was next subjected to the Bj rkman extraction procedure as described in Section 4.5 to furnish a cellulase digested lignin enriched isolate 306.1 mg 18.4 yield of estimated AcBr lignin content in CWR see Section 2.3.5.3 . The cellulase digested CWR from CAD double mutant was treated in the same manner to give a poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde enriched extract 157.4 mg 17.4 yield of estimated AcBr absorbing components solubilized from the CWR.

Molecular weight distributions of lignin enriched isolates. Molecular weight distributions MWD s of the lignin and poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates from WT and CAD double mutant lines were estimated by gel permeation chromatography GPC using a Sephadex G 100 column as previously described Laskar et al. 2006 .

NMR spectroscopic analyses of lignin enriched isolates. NMR spectra of lignin and poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates 30 mg were individually recorded as described in Section 4.1. For C NMR two dimensional phase sensitive gradient selected HMQC and HMBC spectra were recorded using similar acquisition parameters as previously described Laskar et al. 2006 .

AcBr lignin poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde alkaline nitrobenzene and thioacidolysis determinations. The lignin and poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde contents of extractive free CWR samples for each line were estimated by the AcBr method Iiyama Wallis 1990 Blee et al. 2001 using recalculated AcBr lignin and poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde extinction coefficients with monomeric compositions estimated by thioacidolysis. From previous studies the AcBr extinction coefficients for H G and S enriched lignins were estimated to be 15.31 l gcm H units 18.61 l gcm G units 14.61 l gcm S units Cardenas et al. manuscript submitted and 24.83 l gcmfor the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde component see Section 2.3.5.3 . Monomeric compositions were estimated using both alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation Iiyama Lam 1990 and thioacidolysis Rolando et al. 1992 Blee et al. 2001 methods with all products 84 89 90 94 and 97 100 identified by comparison to calibration against authentic standards.

Chemical syntheses. The 8 O 4 linked p hydroxycinnamaldehyde model compounds 95 and 96 were obtained in similar yield to that of Kim et al. 2000 2002. These were individually subjected to thioacidolysis Rolando et al. 1992 Blee et al. 2001 to individually furnish the indene derivatives 97 100 in comparable yields to that of Kim et al. 2000 2002.

Dynamic mechanical analysis. Stems of both WT and the CAD double mutant at 6 and 7 weeks growth development were tested in the tension mode using a TRITEC 2000 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer. Three different stems with 3 replications of each were tested in each case. Measurements were carried out exactly as described in Patten et al. 2007.

Growth parameters and losses in dynamic modulus properties in cad 4 cad 5 cad c cad d bolting stem sections. Prior to investigating the nature of the phenolic materials deposited in stem tissue cell walls of WT ecotype Wassilewskiia and the corresponding CAD double mutant the overall growth development from germination until maturation senescence onset of both lines was first compared. Concomitantly estimations of the overall dynamic modulus properties of the resulting stems and analysis of histochemical staining patterns using reagents typically used for lignin were carried out for each line.

In terms of overall gross growth developmental indices no visible differences were noted between the WT and the double mutant lines at the rosette leaf developmental stage. In both cases rosette sizes were similar with no observable differences in rosette leaf formation from germination until about 3 weeks growth development data not shown . The most striking visible phenotypical difference observed however between both lines was in the overall structural integrity of the inflorescence stem at 4 weeks until maturation the stems of the double mutant became prostrate in contrast to that of WT Sibout et al. 2005 . These data suggested a weakened vasculature apparatus for the CAD double mutant. Additionally both stem lengths and diameters were consistently slightly smaller 25 and 15 for the double mutant line when compared to WT and . In this regard a reduction in stem length had also been noted for the CAD double mutant albeit without either any specific quantification or indication of trend development Sibout et al. 2005 .

It was thus next useful to compare and contrast dynamic moduli properties of both WT and CAD double mutant lines in order to obtain some additional insight into possible structural integrity differences in the resulting tissues. Dynamic mechanical analyses DMA were therefore performed in the tension mode where the storage tensile and loss moduli represent the elastic and viscous components of the complex modulus. The stems of both WT and the double mutant were compared at 6 and 7 weeks growth development using 3 different stems and 3 replications. The CAD double mutant line had a consistently lower tensile storage modulus E approximately half 7.1 10Pa than that of the WT line 1.37 10Pa whereas the loss moduli E of both were very similar . To further establish differences in dynamic mechanical properties of both lines the storage and loss moduli of stems harvested at weeks 6 and 7 were compared at an 0.02 strain level using a paired t test . Significant differences in storage moduli were again observed between both lines at weeks 6 p value 0.036 and 7 p value 0.014 . Thus the elastic component of dynamic modulus in tension is significantly reduced in the CAD double mutant whereas the loss moduli for both are similar at weeks 6 p value 0.951 and 7 p value 0.241 .

Histochemical analyses. Attention was next given to the histological detection of lignin phenolics in the cell wall tissues of the developing stems of both WT and CAD double mutant lines. The two protocols utilized were phloroglucinol HCl for putative p hydroxycinnamaldehyde end groups 14 16 and 18 and the M ule reaction for detection of syringyl S moieties Patten et al. 2005 . Plant lines were analyzed at 4 6 and 8 weeks at the apex middle and basal regions for this report however only basal stem data are described . These analyses when taken together represent the early stages of bolting stem development 3.5 weeks until maturation onset of senescence 8 weeks .

For fresh hand cut stem tissues of the WT line in the absence of any histological stain for lignin the guaiacyl G rich xylem x as well as protoxylem px and interfascicular fibers if were readily discernible at all stages of growth development. These were however not markedly different in color from the other cell tissue types under the differential interference contrast DIC conditions used for visualization and . For the CAD double mutant on the other hand as maturation proceeded there was a build up of a distinct pigmentation in all lignifying elements i.e. orange brownish for x versus reddish orange for if see and .

This pigmentation was observed throughout all of the remaining phases of growth development until maturation senescence onset as had been previously noted with various other CAD down regulated lines Halpin et al. 1994 Higuchi et al. 1994 . The red coloration was however readily removed by treatment with acidic MeOH containing 0.5 HCl see versus as also observed for tobacco Laskar et al. 2007 the corresponding treatment for WT is shown for comparison purposes versus .

Next for both WT and double mutant lines phloroglucinol HCl staining gave qualitatively similar positive results for presumed p hydroxycinnamaldehyde end groups at all growth developmental stages i.e. from 4 8 weeks . However the CAD double mutant apparently gave a somewhat darker red pigmentation compared to WT. The M ule reagent presumed to be syringyl S moiety specific also displayed extensive orange staining in the if regions for both the WT and the double mutant lines at 4 6 and 8 weeks but was largely absent in the xylem x and protoxylem px tissues known to be G rich Patten et al. 2005 . At maturation 8 weeks both staining methods indicated the presence of lignified phloem fibers pf in WT and although these were not detected in the CAD double mutant under the same conditions and .

Characterization of cell wall derived biopolymers from WT and cad 4 cad 5 double mutant lines. Attention was next given to applying developing methodologies to extract the lignins from the WT cell walls as well as that of any biopolymeric phenolic material present in the CAD double mutant for this purpose plant stems were selected and harvested in each case at maturation 8 weeks growth and development . Specifically for each preparation the determinations required at the minimum accurate and or improved estimations of extinction coefficients molecular weight distributions MWD s assessment by H and C NMR spectroscopic analyses of the chemical nature of the biopolymeric substructures as well as estimation of various inter unit linkage frequencies e.g. 8 O 4 bonds .

Phenolic biopolymer isolation protocols. Whole extractive free stem tissues of both lines were thus individually subjected to two different isolation procedures namely the modified Bj rkman protocol Bjorkman 1954 Jourdes et al. manuscipt in preparation with or without an initial cellulase digestion step see Methods . In this way from WT stem tissue 10 g the modified Bj rkman procedure alone afforded a lignin enriched isolate 210 mg so called milled wood lignin MWL whereas with prior cellulase digestion a cellulase liberated MWL isolate 382 mg was obtained. In an analogous manner the CAD double mutant stem tissues 10 g gave 160 and 196 mg of isolates. Overall the cellulase digestion step appears to be even more effective with WT tissues since the amounts of isolate increased by 80 .

Estimations of extinction coefficients in dioxane. The UV spectra of the lignin isolates from the WT line with or without prior cellulase digestion gave absorption maxima at 281 nm estimated 15.75 0.35 l gcm in dioxane corresponding to a typical G S lignin chromophore . By contrast the IV spectra of the phenolic isolates obtained from the CAD double mutant were very different from that of the WT lignin isolates and exhibited a bathochromic shift to 325 nm with an estimated 28.17 0.25 l gcm.

Molecular weight distributions. The molecular weight distributions MWD of both WT and double mutant lignin enriched isolates with and without prior cellulase treatment were next subjected to gel permeation chromatography GPC using a pre calibrated Sephadex G 100 column Laskar et al. 2006 eluted with 0.1 M Noah the latter eluant has been employed in order to attempt to minimize associative effects in lignin derived preparations Dutta et al. 1989 . All four samples had relatively broad MWD s with estimated molecular weights Mw s centered at 4 600 Da for the two lignin enriched isolates from WT versus 4 000 Da for the CAD double mutant preparations . Molecular weight averages were estimated following calibration of the Sephadex G 100 column with sodium polystyrene sulfonates Mw s 1 430 5 180 29 000 79 000 and coniferyl alcohol 3 M180 with polydispersity index values M M calculated 2.1 for the WT lignin enriched isolates and 1.8 for the CAD double mutant preparations. As already noted for other WT lignin derived isolates Laskar et al. 2006 the polydispersity indices are considered to possibly reflect random cleavage during mechanical ball milling treatment 4 days rather than the actual molecular weight distributions of the phenolic materials present in situ.

NMR spectroscopic analyses. Various NMR spectroscopic analyses were next carried out in order to begin to compare the types of assignable interunit linkages substructures present in the various polymeric isolates. A limitation of this approach however is that this methodology is currently not yet very applicable to either readily obtain lignin primary chain sequence data and or to identify all structural entities present . e.g. in the lignins. Nevertheless the preparations obtained from WT and the CAD double mutant were individually subjected to NMR H C 2 D HMQC and 2D HMBC spectroscopic analyses and .

Lignin isolates from WT. The 1 D C NMR spectra of the WT lignin enriched isolates were those of typical G S lignins present in as previously reported for WT ecotypes Landsberg erecta Laskar et al. 2006 and Columbia Marita et al. 1999 these are summarized below only as needed for comparative context. Thus characteristic methoxyl group signals were readily observable at 55.8 ppm with the corresponding aromatic ring resonances assignable as before i.e. 102 107 and 150 154 ppm for tertiary carbons 2 6 and quaternary carbons 3 5 in S aromatic units with comparable G unit resonances at 107 124 ppm and 145 154 ppm for tertiary aromatic carbons 2 5 6 and quaternary carbons 3 4 respectively. Signals for the quaternary carbon 1 for G units and carbons 1 and 4 for S units overlapped between 125 to 140 ppm.

2D HMQC analyses were used to examine the various oxygenated carbon resonances in the aliphatic region 50 90 ppm Lewis et al. 1987 Karhunen et al. 1995 Ralph et al. 2004 b and Laskar et al. 2006 . As before the five expected G S substructures were identified namely 8 O 4 aryl ether substructure I resinol like substructure II phenylcoumaran substructure III dibenzodioxocin substructure IV and cinnamyl alcohol end groups substructure V . All were assigned through their characteristic carbon proton correlations c i.e. 59.6 3.20 and 59.6 3.57 C H 82.9 4.20 C H and 70.8 4.68 C H ppm for 8 O 4 aryl ether substructure I 70.7 3.71 and 70.7 4.08 C H C H 53.3 3.01 C H C H and 84.6 4.59 C H C H ppm for resinol like substructure II 62.6 3.69 and 62.6 3.32 C H 52.6 3.38 C H and 86.4 5.42 C H ppm for phenylcoumaran substructure III 61.3 4.05 and 61.3 3.95 C H 85.7 4.09 C H and 83.2 4.71 C H ppm for dibenzodioxocin substructure IV as well as 61.6 4.3 C H ppm for cinnamyl alcohol end groups V . Other inter unit linkages such as 8 1 diphenyl and or diphenyl ether bonds were not definitively identified due to overlapping resonances. As noted before this is a limitation of the techniques currently employed Laskar et al. 2006 .

As already also described Laskar et al. 2006 minor aldehydic resonances were observed at 190.7 and 194.2 ppm with these being assignable to cinnamyl aldehyde VI and benzaldehyde VII moieties . In particular the 2D HMBC spectroscopic analysis gave clear correlations between the benzaldehydic carbon at 190.7 ppm and two equivalent protons at 7.18 ppm for carbons 2 6 in syringaldehyde moieties substructure VIIc . By contrast no correlations were detected for either vanillin or p hydroxybenzaldehyde substructures i.e. VIIb or VIIa. For cinnamyl aldehyde VI like substructures two different correlations between the aldehydic carbon at 194.2 ppm and the benzylic protons on carbon 7 at 7.57 ppm and 7.61 ppm were observed. In addition the proton 7 at 7.57 ppm correlated with the two equivalent aromatic carbons 2 6 106.3 ppm in a sinapyl aldehydic moiety substructure VIc . In an analogous manner the proton 7 at 7.61 ppm correlated with aromatic carbons 2 6 at 112.7 123.4 ppm which in turn corresponded to a coniferyl aldehyde moiety substructure VIb . On the other hand no correlations corresponding to a p hydroxycinnamaldehyde moiety substructure Via were detected. According to the relative correlation intensities substructure VIb was apparently more abundant than substructure VIc. The presence of these minor aldehydic substructures VIb VIc and VIIc were reported previously Laskar et al. 2006 .

Further confirmation of substructures I to IV was made through 2D HMBC analyses. This established the presence of three bond correlations between their carbon 7 at 70.8 ppm for I 84.6 ppm for II 86.4 ppm for III and at 83.2 ppm for IV with the aromatic protons of carbons 2 6 at 6.8 6.9 ppm G units and 6.6 ppm S units respectively. These substructures were apparently mainly present as G units substructures I IVb and to a lesser extent S units substructures I IVc . However as expected the WT lignin enriched isolates contained minor amounts of impurities that are generally observed in lignin preparations. These are marked by x and c in e.g. for carbohydrates c as indicated by resonances between 95 101 ppm anomeric carbons and 70 80 ppm and also for glycerides esterified with acetyl groups OAc 170 ppm .

NMR spectroscopic analyses of the CAD double mutant isolates. Both isolates were subjected to NMR spectroscopic analyses H C 2D HMQC and 2D HMBC as described above and which established the presence of poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde moieties and . As for the WT lignin isolates intense signals at 55.8 ppm characteristic of methoxyl groups attached to G S aromatic nuclei were observed . However the C spectra of both isolates differed markedly from the WT lignin enriched isolates particularly in the oxygenated aliphatic regions that is monolignol derived substructures II III IV and V could not be detected as such and the aromatic regions also displayed a quite distinct chemical shift profile at least down to the noise level. Additionally in the aldehydic region more intense resonances corresponding to aldehydic end group substructures VI and VII as well as two new signals at 186.4 and 187.8 ppm provisionally assigned to substructure VIII were observed and . The C spectrum of the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde also contains similar minor impurities as marked by x and c in as previously observed for the WT isolate spectra .

Application of 2D HMQC spectroscopic analysis to the aliphatic C regions oxygenated carbon resulted however only in detection of the monolignol derived 8 O 4 aryl ether substructure I. This was evident from small but characteristic correlations at 59.6 3.20 and 59.6 3.57 C H 82.9 4.20 C H and 70.8 4.68 C H ppm . Once again substructures II V were not detected as above.

The main aldehyde derived substructures present were next identified using 2D HMQC and 2D HMBC spectroscopic analyses i.e. by examining specific correlations with those in the aldehydic carbon region 180 200 ppm . Overall different types of substructures were identified according to the peaks detected in the HMBC spectra cinnamaldehyde end groups substructure VI 8 O 4 aryl ether linked cinnamaldehydes substructure VIII and benzaldehydes substructure VII these substructures were all previously observed in CAD downregulated tobacco Kim et al. 2003 Laskar et al. 2007 as well as in a CAD deficient pine mutant line Kim et al. 2003 .

The presence of cinnamaldehyde end groups was readily confirmed not only from the large resonance at 194.1 ppm in the C spectra but also from the intense correlations noted between aldehydic carbon 9 at 194.1 ppm and proton 9 at 9.63 ppm in the HMQC spectra as well as with proton 7 at 7.61 ppm in the HMBC spectra . Designation of aromatic ring nuclei was next determined via analyses of long range correlations between proton 7 and carbon 2 6 at 112.7 123.4 ppm G units substructure VIb and at 106.3 ppm S units substructure VIc . Note however that the correlation at 194.1 7.61 ppm may also include other possible substructures possessing a similar aldehydic side chain from carbons 7 to 9 e.g. substructures X and XI Kim et al. 2003 .

In an analogous manner benzaldehydic substructures VII were detected through correlations in the 2D HMBC spectra between the aldehydic carbon 7 at 190.7 ppm and the two aromatic protons 2 6 . Correlations were mainly observed between the benzaldehydic carbon at 190.7 ppm and two equivalent protons 2 6 at 7.26 ppm corresponding to a syringaldehydic moiety substructure VIIc whereas a much smaller correlation with protons 2 6 at 7.54 ppm was indicative of a vanillin substructure VIIb .

The relatively large resonances at 186.4 ppm and 187.8 ppm in the C spectra were next assigned to 8 O 4 styryl O aryl ether linkages substructure VIII and depending on the nature of the aromatic ring connected to carbon 8 through ether linkages. The latter can be either in a G substructure VIII 1 and VIII 2 see S and or 5 substituted G substructure VIII 3 and VIII 4 unit. The presence of the four 8 O 4 styryl O aryl ether substructures VIII 1 to VIII 4 was also evident from analysis of the HMBC spectra with each identified through specific long range correlations between the aldehydic carbon 9 and proton 7 c i.e. 187.8 7.46 for VIII 1 187.8 7.40 for VIII 2 186.4 6.83. for VIII 3 and 186.4 6.77 for VIII 4.

Of particular interest was the presence of substructure IX containing a fully conjugated benzofuran skeleton 8 5 like substructure and . This was identified by comparison of spectroscopic features for the somewhat analogous benzofuran aldehydic lignan 79 so called XH 14 isolated from Bunge Danshen Yang et al. 1991 as well as with the benzofuran aldehyde 80 obtained by total synthesis Moinuddin et al. unpublished results . The metabolite 79 had a specific correlation in the HMQC spectrum at 186.7 10.26 ppm between the aldehydic carbon 9 and the aldehydic proton 9 as did synthetic 800 which had a correlation at 186.5 10.33 ppm. Identical correlations were also observed in the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates. Formation of substructure s IX presumably results from coupling of the corresponding aldehydes to initially generate expected substructures such as XIV and XV. It is currently unknown however when during either plant growth development and or phenolic isolation re aromatization occurs to give IX as well as the significance of its formation.

To Applicants knowledge substructure IX was not previously reported in any CAD mutant line Kim et al. 2003 . However by contrast the 8 5 linked substructures XIV and XV were readily detected in different synthetic dehydropolymerizates these being generated by oxidative coupling of either coniferyl aldehyde 16 alone Conners et al. 1970 Russell et al. 2000 or a mixture of coniferyl aldehyde 16 and coniferyl alcohol 21 Kim et al. 2003 . Yet as mentioned above these were not detected in the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates obtained in this study. This is perhaps indicative of further differences between random coupling in vitro and that of the proteinaceous machinery in the plant cell walls controlling oxidative polymerization see below .

The presence of an 8 8 cinnamaldehyde substructure substructure XII was also reported in lignin isolates from CAD downregulated tobacco Kim et al. 2003 as well as in different synthetic poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde dehydropolymerizates Conners et al. 1970 Russell et al. 2000 . However in applicants hands this substructure could not be unambiguously identified by NMR spectroscopic analysis in the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates under the conditions employed. Although very tiny resonances in the C spectrum at 192.5 ppm were provisionally assignable to an 8 8 cinnamaldehyde substructure substructure XII there were no expected correlations in the 2D HMBC spectra to confirm its presence further indicating that at best it was only present in very small amounts. A second 8 8 cinnamaldehyde substructure substructure XIII which was also reported as being present in a synthetic poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde dehydropolymerizate formed from a mixture of 16 and 21 Kim et al. 2003 was also not detected in the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates from the CAD double mutant.

Finally from the analyses of HMBC spectra of the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates various other correlations were observed but which could not yet be unambiguously assigned these will be investigated further in future.

Alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation NBO thioacidolysis degradation acetyl bromide analyses. Alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation NBO and thioacidolysis degradation procedures are currently routinely applied to the analysis of plant materials due to their abilities to cleave various linkages in lignins as well as that of related phenolics. For example NBO oxidation of lignin model compounds 81 83 affords the various lignin derived products 84 89 Schultz and Templeton 1986 Schultz et al. 1987 . For lignins this procedure results in a homolytic oxidative fission of their 7 8 linkages and ultimately cleavage of the 8 O 4 bonds as well Schultz and Templeton 1986 Schultz et al. 1987 . This method can however give overestimations if there are significant amounts of other non lignin cell wall bound p hydroxycinnamic acids aldehydes present Anterola Lewis 2002 . For thioacidolysis the overall main monomeric monolignol derived degradation products 90 92 obtained from lignins proper are depicted in their formation has also been studied using model compounds 81 83 containing 8 O 4 inter unit linkages. For the lignins both procedures are generally employed to estimate H G S ratios as well as amounts of releasable products relative to lignin contents and or cell wall residues CWR . The acetyl bromide AcBr method by contrast solubilizes phenolic materials such as lignin and is often generally employed to estimate lignin contents from various plant sources.

Nitrobenzene oxidation. Alkaline nitrobenzene oxidations NBO of the four isolates from the WT and the CAD double mutant were thus next carried out. For both isolates from the WT line the total amounts of H G and S monomeric units released were 1359 7.9 moles g without cellulase pretreatment and 1214 28.5 moles g with cellulase pretreatment with H G S ratios of 1 85 14 and 1 87 12 respectively TABLE 6 . This in turn accounted for 27 and 24 by weight of the lignin isolates assuming the products had originated from CCmoieties .

Treatment of the corresponding CAD double mutant isolates gave somewhat similar findings in terms of total amounts of monomers released 1274 10.5 and 1197 11.9 moles g with overall recoveries of 26 and 24 . On the other hand the H G S ratios differed significantly 1 68 31 and 1 69 30 from that of WT indicative of a significant increase in both amounts of S units released with a comparable decrease in G moieties. Taken together the alkaline NBO degradation data for all four isolates indicated that there were roughly equimolar populations of cleavable releasable monomers present.

Thioacidolysis. Treatment of the two lignin derived isolates from the WT line gave 1149 18.3 and 1131 19.8 moles gof total thioacidolysis monomers with H G S ratios of 1 83 16 and 1 82 17 respectively TABLE 6 . As noted these were largely the monolignol derived products 90 92 and to a much smaller extent they also resulted from cleavage of tiny amounts of aldehydic end groups in presumed 8 O 4 linkages isolated as compounds 93 and 94 . Taken together however the thioacidolysis products 90 94 released in both cases accounted for 23 by weight of the lignin isolates. This product recovery data thus also corresponded reasonably closely with the values for the NBO analyses previously described above.

On the other hand the amounts of monolignol derived thioacidolytic cleavage products 90 92 from the CAD double mutant phenolic isolates were only 116 4.6 and 92 5.3 moles g with these values in both cases corresponding to 10 of the phenolic isolates. Interestingly the monolignol derived moieties had H G S ratios of 1 83 16 and 1 82 17 TABLE 6 which were comparable to the ratio obtained for the lignin in the WT lines.

In the previous preliminary analysis of the CAD double mutant Sibout et al. 2005 it was reported that the various indene derivatives 97 100 could also be released following thioacidolysis with these presumed to result from cleavage of 8 O 4 interunit linkages derived from p hydroxycinnamaldehyde 16 and 18 coupling. To investigate this possibility further the corresponding model compounds 95 and 96 were synthesized and individually subjected to quantitative thioacidolysis for calibration purposes. In this way the total amounts of indene derivatives 97 100 end group aldehydes 93 94 and monolignol derived products 90 92 released from the double mutant phenolic isolates were 1050 15.1 and 1041 18.5 moles gmonomers with H G S ratios of 1 72 27 and 1 71 28 respectively TABLE 6 . Thus as also observed from the NBO analyses the H G S ratios differed significantly from that of WT due to an increase in S units. Taken together the thioacidolysis products 90 92 and 97 100 accounted for 21 22 by weight of the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates these values were thus also in the same general range as those determined by the alkaline NBO degradation method.

Acetyl bromide analyses. The acetyl bromide AcBr method is generically used by many researchers to estimate lignin contents in various plant cell wall residues CWR . In this method samples are treated with a reaction mixture consisting of 25 AcBr by volume in glacial acetic acid containing 4 of perchloric acid with lignin estimations determined by measurement of the UV absorptivity 280 nm of the corresponding solubilized material. An extinction coefficient of 20.09 l gcm Iiyama Wallis 1988 1990 has long been generically employed for such lignin estimations but this does not take in the account differences in extinction coefficients of lignins with varying H G and S compositions in different plant lines and or the presence of any other interfering chromophores. When applying this generic extinction coefficient to the analyses of the WT lignin enriched isolates lignin contents of 84 were obtained whereas with the CAD double mutant isolates the values were in excess of 110 . The data obtained using the 20.09 l gcmextinction coefficient were thus considered as being potentially unreliable.

In order to attempt to more accurately determine the AcBr values for each isolate from the WT and the double mutant the AcBr extinction coefficients were next individually determined 280 nm . This gave estimated values of 17.85 l gcmfor the WT lignin isolates and 23.61 l gcmfor the CAD poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates.

As noted earlier for both WT lignin isolates the alkaline NBO and thioacidolysis procedures had given very similar estimated monomeric H G S ratios of 1 85 14 and 1 83 16. The AcBr extinction coefficient based on these monomeric ratios was then next theoretically calculated using the AcBr extinction coefficients previously obtained for purified H G and S enriched lignin isolates i.e. H 15.31 G 18.61 and S 14.61 l gcm Cardenas et al. manuscript submitted . In this way an AcBr extinction coefficient of 17.98 l gcmwas theoretically calculated according to the monomeric composition obtained by thioacidolysis of the WT lignin enriched lignin isolates. This calculated value was thus in very good agreement 99.3 with that experimentally determined. Using either of these extinction coefficient values the estimated AcBr lignin contents for 8 week old mature WT stem tissue were 20.8 for the cell wall residue CWR and 48.7 for the cellulase degraded material as well as 99 for the isolated lignin preparation Table 1 . Note we are aware that the 99 lignin purity of the isolate is slightly over estimated since such preparations generally contain 5 8 of non lignin impurities e.g. as noted in the NMR C spectra .

In an analogous manner using the experimentally determined AcBr extinction coefficient of 23.61 l gcmfor the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates together with that of the monomeric compositions estimated by thioacidolysis it was also possible to theoretically calculate an AcBr extinction coefficient for the poly aldehydic component alone i.e. by subtracting the absorbance due to the H G S monolignol derived units. As indicated above based on the thioacidolysis data the monolignol derived moieties 28 30 and the aldehyde derived constituents 31 32 and 35 38 were present in a 9 1 ratio. This correction thus gave a theoretically calculated AcBr extinction coefficient of 24.83 l gcmfor the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde. Based on both extinction coefficients the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde lignin contents for the double mutant line were estimated as follows 11.3 in the extractive free cell wall residue CWR of 8 week TABLE 6 .

Lignin contents releasable monomeric compositions and inter unit linkage frequencies. The lignin and poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde contents as well as the monomeric compositions of the extractive free cell wall residues CWR from the WT and CAD double mutant lines were next estimated at different developmental stages i.e. from 3.5 to 10 weeks . For comparison purposes the thioacidolysis and AcBr data obtained herein were also compared to data previously reported for various WT and other putative cad mutant lines with these being ostensibly harvested and analyzed at plant maturation see Eudes et al. 2006 disscussed below Note that in general the H G S ratio and amounts in the CWR s of both WT and CAD double mutant lines had higher S contents than that of the lignin and poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates indicative of hydrolytic changes occurring during the isolation protocols TABLE 6 .

For the WT line in this study lignin contents were again estimated using AcBr extinction coefficients calculated according to the thioacidolysis derived monomeric compositions determined for each sample. The AcBr lignin contents thus increased rapidly during the stem bolting stage until reaching maximum levels close to maturation 6 wks as previously reported for other WT ecotypes i.e. Landsberg erecta Patten et al. 2005 and Columbia Cardenas et al. manuscript submitted . The amounts of alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation NBO 22 27 and thioacidolysis 28 32 releasable monomers also followed the same trends again increasing linearly with lignin deposition and . These trends were thus in good agreement with values previously obtained for Landsberg and Columbia lines. Recoveries of degradation products 22 27 and 28 32 relative to estimated lignin contents were 24 to 27 NBO and 23 thioacidolysis .

In an analogous manner the AcBr values from the CAD double mutant lines were obtained at the same sampling time points with poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde and lignin contents computed based on their relative aldehydic and monolignol contents and ratios 9 1 i.e. using 24.83 l gcmfor the estimated AcBr extinction coefficient of the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde component and the theoretically calculated AcBr extinction coefficients 15.31 for H 18.61 for G and 14.61 l gcmfor S units for the lignin see Section 2.3.5.3 . These data thus also established a progressive albeit attenuated relative to the WT line increase in phenolic deposition which reached maximum values at 6 8 weeks growth development . For alkaline NBO analyses with the double mutant the data so obtained showed a relatively rapid increase in monomer release from 3 6 weeks until reaching maximum values . However in the CAD double mutant there was only 36 of the monomer amounts released relative to that from the WT lines at maturation i.e. in accordance with the much lower poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde lignin contents. Based on the absorptivity values the maximum levels of phenolics in the CAD double mutant CWR were 11.3 or about half of the WT lignin content 22.5 for WT .

Using degradative thioacidolysis analyses the monomeric products released from the CAD double mutant CWR were now largely the indene derivatives 35 38 with minor amounts of end group aldehydes 31 32 and monolignol derived 28 30 entities . Nevertheless the data displayed the same overall trend as for the NBO analyses i.e. an increase from 3 6 weeks until reaching a maximum value with in this case overall amounts being 27 of those from the WT lines . Recoveries of products 28 32 and 35 38 relative to the estimated poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde and lignin contents were estimated to be 22 and thus similar to that for the WT line above.

Finally the total amounts of products released by NBO and thioacidolysis degradative analyses for both the WT and the double mutant CWR s were plotted versus that of each AcBr lignin AcBr phenolic content and .

Evolutionary implications and technological limitations in lignin analyses. The generally accepted biochemical entry point into the monolignol lignin pathway is the essential amino acid Phe which during the course of vascular plant evolution from their aquatic forerunner beginnings 430 million years ago Bolwell et al. 2001 was utilized as the carbon skeleton for a vast array of downstream phenylpropanoid pathway products. These downstream metabolic processes thus involved deamination hydroxylation methylation and various reductive transformations thereby affording the various monolignols 1 3 and 5 and ultimately the lignins found in the 350 000 distinct vascular plant species extant today for a review see Lewis et al. 1999 Anterola and Lewis 2002 . Significantly based on decades of lignin analyses using a very large number of vascular plant species Sarkanen and Ludwig 1971 it was already by then very well established that there was a very strong evolutionary pressure for lignin macromolecular configuration from the three monolignols 19 21 and 23 as well as to a lesser extent from the closely related p hydroxycinnamate monolignol ester derivatives in grasses Lewis and Yamamoto 1990 . However these studies gave no insight into how control over lignin macromolecular configuration was achieved.

Based on the above trends it was thus quite unlikely that lignin macromolecular configuration from either structural and or physiological function perspectives could be adequately duplicated and or substituted through surrogate monomeric phenol replacement i.e. such as had been reported earlier with the p hydroxycinnamic acids 4 8 2 methoxybenzaldehyde 76 feruloyl tyramine 78 derivatives and others including acetosyringone 77 Ralph et al. 1997 1998 2004a Boudet 1998 . Such reports however either gave no quantification data in support of these contentions and or could not be confirmed in independent analyses Anterola and Lewis 2002 Laskar et al. 2006 . The findings in this Example which now demonstrate a very limited capacity for poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde placement in the cell wall thus shed incisive light as to why monolignol derived lignification has evolved as such a potent selection force. That is this study provides useful insight as to why lignin macromolecular configuration in terms of being monolignol derived is very highly conserved thoughout the plant kingdom. More specifically the CAD double mutant described herein has now also provided an excellent opportunity to begin to comprehensively investigate macromolecular lignin assembly and the various effects on its disruption.

Overall gross growth developmental trends and losses in biomechanical tissue properties implications for commercial cultivars. The physiological effects of the CAD double mutation were very striking . While this resulted in a significant reduction in both bolting stem lengths and diameters by 25 and 15 and there was more importantly a significant loss in overall stem structural integrity properties and . That is the storage and tensile loss moduli for the mutant stem tissues were greatly reduced by 50 relative to that of the WT line with the physiological consequences being that the mutant became essentially prostrate . It is not possible at this time to gauge from these analyses however the exact contribution of each of the various cell wall biopolymers lignin cellulose hemicellulose cell wall proteins to the overall stem tissue mechanical properties. It is evident though that formation of only 10 of the monolignol derived lignin relative to WT on a per lignin poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde weight basis at maturation TABLE 6 and the limited deposition of other phenolics i.e. the p hydroxycinnamaldehydes 6 10 discussed below were insufficient to restore and or duplicate the original WT stem material properties structural integrity. Moreover it was established by Applicants that both AtCAD4 and AtCAD5 were also expressed in various organs and cell types other than stem tissues i.e. leaf trichomes leaf hydathodes leaf vasculature various floral organs siliques root tissues and so forth these findings thus suggest that their structural integrities will also be adversely affected.

From a physiological function perspective it must also be considered that the plant lines analyzed herein were grown under highly favorable and controlled growth chamber greenhouse conditions which are unlikely to be duplicated in the wild. That is the reductions in vascular tissue structural integrity observed herein may be less useful traits when such plant lines are subjected to the environment wind rain snow heat cold etc. . Furthermore these lines may also be more prone susceptible to pathogen attack particularly since the vascular apparatus is often the main target. Moreover with the current emphasis on reducing lignin contents in vascular plants e.g. for improved bioethanol wood pulp and paper production etc. it is clear that such effects may impact the potential for lignin biotechnological modification from a commercial cultivar standpoint. These are important aspects to evaluate when considering applications involving usage of large swaths of agricultural forest or marginal lands to harbor such lignin modified crops.

The results obtained in this Example are also consistent with previous investigations using other CAD mutants and or CAD down regulated lines i.e. in terms of impaired compromised structural integrity of stem tissues. For example in maize the main disadvantages of CAD mutations known for nearly 70 years but currently largely overlooked by many researchers have likely affected practical commercial considerations. The limitations reported have included lowering of grain silage yield increased lodging susceptibility poor early season vigor delayed flowering and delayed early season growth rates Weller et al. 1985 Gentinetta et al. 1990 . In addition in loblolly pine the CAD mutant together with unknown mutations displayed various growth developmental and structural disadvantages L. Pearson Westvaco personal communication which to Applicants knowledge has retarded commercial application at present. Furthermore in poplar CAD down regulated lines displayed compromised biochemical properties indicative of vascular apparatus weakening Huang et al. 1999 . Similar conclusions were made with CAD downregulated tobacco which resulted in reductions in longitudinal tensile modulus properties Hepworth and Vincent 1998 . These reports thus underscore the practical considerations when considering potential commercial utilization and thus relate to the level of vascular apparatus modification that can be achieved while maintaining acceptable structural properties.

The limited utility of histochemical analyses. The staining reactions observed when individually using phloroglucinol HCl and the M ule reagent were of limited utility. While the first reagent can react with p hydroxycinnamaldehyde end groups 14 18 the procedure is not suitable for quantification. Moreover the staining using phloroglucinol HCl gave qualitatively similar results for both WT and CAD double mutant lines . A somewhat comparable situation existed for the M ule reaction which also gave fairly similar levels of staining for both lines even though the double mutant had an increased S level relative to WT.

Most striking was the red pigmentation in the CAD double mutant this being readily removed by treatment with 0.5 HCl in MeOH as demonstrated earlier Laskar et al. 2007 i.e. under similar conditions as for anthocyanin extraction Andersen et al. 2004 . This suggests that the small amounts of p hydroxycinnamaldehydes 16 and 18 resulting in cell wall pigmentation are not covalently linked but are instead misplaced and adsorbed onto the cell wall e.g. following apoptosis to generate the intense pigmentation observed. As noted by Laskar et al. 2007 the pigment co elutes with the parent molecule sinapyl aldehyde 10 when subjected to polyamide TLC purification.

Effects on carbon allocation and metabolic flux. A quite striking observation is that the overall phenolic content of the CAD double mutant was reduced by 50 relative to WT with the releasable monomers through presumed 8 O 4 linkage cleavage also being significantly reduced by 63 and 73 for alkaline NBO and thioacidolysis . These data thus clearly demonstrate that phenolic biopolymer carbon allocation to the cell walls was greatly attenuated. This is of interest given that previous metabolic flux analysis studies had indicated that CAD under normal physiological conditions had neither regulatory nor key roles in carbon allocation in the monolignol forming pathway Anterola et al. 1999 2002 . This is in contrast to other assertions that CAD was a key enzyme Baucher et al. 1996 . Of course any biochemical step becomes rate limiting or key if essentially eliminated as has largely occurred with the CAD double mutant.

In general CAD down regulation in various plant species apparently had no deleterious effects on overall lignin contents in transgenic antisense sense lines as determined by Klason AcBr and thioglycollic acid TGA analyses see Anterola and Lewis 2002 . However all of the prior data obtained with tobacco Halpin et al. 1994 Hibino et al. 1995 Yahiaoui et al. 1998 poplar Baucher et al. 1996 Lapierre et al. 1999 and alfalfa Baucher et al. 1998 had employed generic approaches for quantification discussed in detail below in Section 3.5.1 . Furthermore in the Anterola and Lewis 2002 review it was noted that there were most likely reductions in lignin contents proper when CAD downregulation occurred e.g. since overall biophysical chemical properties of the tissues were deleteriously affected.

The data in this Example now establishes that additional factors influence carbon allocation to the pathway in the CAD double mutant which may result from either transcriptional regulation substrate product pathway intermediate feedback inhibition and or perception of a failure to obtain the needed cell wall biopolymeric properties. The main point of interest is that there was no compensatory replacement for macromolecular lignin configuration by seamless insertion of other non lignin moieties poly p hydroxycinnamaldehydes or indeed of any other entities. By contrast the limited deposition of the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde moieties was aborted at a very early stage of monomer cleavable 8 O 4 substructure formation and . This suggests that there is a regulatory checkpoint beyond which such processes if futile can not be sustained. Thus taken together this resulted in generation of rather structurally defective plants whether from either a reduced carbon allocation and or structural integrity perspective. These findings thus contrast with other reports that proposed seamless replacement of non monolignol components Ralph et al. 1997 2004a . Specifically the findings in this Example now place further emphasis on the importance of lignin structure and that perfectly viable plants are not always produced upon monolignol pathway manipulation.

Lignins and Other Cell Wall poly phenolics Evidence for Monomer Degeneracy During Template Polymerization 

Quantification of lignin amounts by Klason and acetyl bromide analyses Current limitations and technological advances. This Example also brings to the forefront once again the serious technological challenges that continue to severely limit investigations in the lignin field as well as that of related polyphenolic analyses i.e. when routinely applying so called standard techniques such as generic Klason AcBr thioglycollic acid lignin determinations and other degradation methodologies e.g. thioacidolysis.

Of these the two most widely utilized protocols for currently estimating gross lignin contents are the Klason and AcBr methods. The first method while generally applicable to mature woody plant material has long been known to have substantial limitations when generically applied to both herbaceous and immature woody tissues discussed in Anterola and Lewis 2002 and references therein . Yet it is still routinely applied. One example of its unreliability is that of the report of lignin contents in immature approximately one year old poplar stems x with these being as high as 32 Huntley et al. 2003 whereas other research groups analyzing 3 month and 2 year old poplar indicated that the levels were 20 Van Doorsselaere et al. 1995 Lapierre et al. 1999 Jouanin et al. 2000 Such values 32 fall well outside the ranges expected since it is established that mature poplar wood tissues have lignin levels 18 21 Sarkanen and Hergert 1971 . If lignin determinations can be overestimated by up to nearly 80 as would appear from the Huntley et al. 2003 report it is unlikely that such approaches are going to identify meaningful trends in lignin deposition composition and assembly proper. Similar concerns about the unreliability of thioglycollic acid lignin determinations Lee et al. 1997 have also been noted and critically evaluated Anterola and Lewis 2002 .

The AcBr method has also been generically applied to numerous lignin determinations using an extinction coefficient of 20.09 l gcm Iiyama and Wallis 1990 Dence 1992 . This method however does not take into account the changes in extinction coefficients due to variations in lignin monomeric H G and S compositions. As noted in this and in a previous investigation using H G and S enriched lignin isolates the best current estimates of the actual extinction coefficients 280 nm are H 15.31 G 18.61 and S 14.61 l gcmfor each Cardenas et al. manuscript submitted . Thus taking the approach of estimating monomeric compositions at a particular stage of growth and development it was possible in this Example to begin to make improved estimates of the actual lignin amounts i.e. using the extinction coefficients and adjusting for monomeric compositions. Applicants are of course cognizant that these values may be slightly revised upwards since the methodologies currently in place to isolate lignins can result in 5 8 of non lignin impurities .

In the case of the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde enriched isolates however there was also an increase in overall absorbance at 280 nm due to the increased levels of the more highly conjugated p hydroxycinnamaldehyde components. Hence by using the experimentally determined values of 24.83 l gcmfor the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde and those above for the lignin component the total cell wall phenolic contents for the CAD double mutant at 8 weeks old plants were estimated to be 11.3 50 of WT level .

Alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation thioacidolysis analyses evidence for monomer degeneracy during template polymerization As described herein the study of the cleavage and frequency of presumed 8 O 4 inter unit linkages leading to monomer release was most instructive from several perspectives. First in the WT line there was a linear correspondence between monomer release and AcBr lignin content with a very similar trend albeit highly attenuated in overall amounts noted for the releasable monomers indene p hydroxycinnamaldehyde end groups monolignols from the CAD double mutant and assuming of course that cleavage of all monomeric releasable linkages are fully accounted for. In the latter case these are derived from the styryl O aryl ethers such as in substructure VIII 1 4 and . Accordingly the model compounds 95 and 96 were synthesized and then converted into authentic thioacidolysis products 97 100 for calibration purposes with the assumption that the yields recoveries obtained for the different reactions isolation procedures reflected similar processes occurring during lignin and poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde deconstruction.

This same approach was not taken in two other studies of the CAD double mutant Sibout et al. 2005 Eudes et al. 2006 and only the monolignol derived thioacidolysis products 90 91 were apparently used for calibration purposes. In any event the indene derivatives 97 100 were estimated to apparently account for just 0.12 of the CWR analyzed. By contrast using the authentic standards in the study herein the amounts of the indene products etc. being formed were determined to be roughly an order of magnitude higher 9 times and which corresponded to 16 of the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates.

Secondly as noted in our previous studies Anterola and Lewis 2002 Patten et al. 2005 the plots of amounts of cleavable monomer release versus either lignin or phenolic poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde lignin contents did not intercept at the origin of the X axis for either plant line. That is the abscissa was displaced away from the origin on the X axis to a point roughly corresponding to either ca 5 AcBr lignin WT or 5 AcBr phenolic CAD double mutant deposition . Significantly however the detection of cleavable monomers for both WT and CAD double mutant lines occurred at apparently equivalent growth developmental stages i.e. suggesting that essentially similar assembly deposition processes were being attempted to be duplicated.

This initial deposition stage of UV absorbing material is often referred to as H enriched condensed lignin and is considered to contain non cleavable carbon carbon linkages e.g. 3 3 5 5 rather than cleavable i.e. monomer releasable 8 O 4 linkages. It is currently unknown however as to whether this early stage of presumed lignin deposition contains other 8 O 4 inter unit linkages that do not release monomeric products upon cleavage. The intercept at ca 5 AcBr lignin WT or 5 AcBr phenol which represents the point of initial detection of monomer cleavable 8 O 4 linkages in both cases gives no insight at present as to whether there is either a gradual or an abrupt structural demarcation between both early and later stages of lignin poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde deposition. Yet beyond this early stage and until macromolecular lignification configuration has either been completed and or poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde deposition is prematurely aborted there was a clear linear correlation between monomer cleavable 8 O 4 inter unit linkage frequency and lignin phenolic contents in both cases. Furthermore by subtracting the initial 5 AcBr lignin amounts in the WT line the cleavable subset of monomer releasable 8 O 4 inter unit linkages in the later stages accounted for up to 42 to 44 of the macromolecular lignin being laid down. In an analogous manner by subtraction of the initial 5 AcBr phenolic content in the CAD double mutant line the overall product recoveries at the point of termination of poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde deposition were 37 to 39 i.e. in very good agreement with the WT value.

Thirdly the data obtained indicated that the overall 8 O 4 inter unit linkage frequencies were conserved in the CAD double mutant relative to that of the WT line i.e. both lines gave equivalent amounts of releasable monomers per gram of estimated lignin poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde. Thus these comparable 8 O 4 inter unit linkage frequencies in both lines may suggest a very limited monomer degeneracy of p hydroxycinnamaldehydes 14 18 for monolignol template polymerization. It is perhaps significant however that the CAD double mutant also retained the ability to form circa 10 of cleavable monolignol derived moieties 90 92 relative to WT which could be detected at each sampling point . One possibility to consider is that as primary monolignol derived lignin chains are first laid down these then provide a pre formed lignin backbone for further template replication Guan et al. 1997 Sarkanen 1998 . That is the p hydroxycinnamaldehyde moieties can be envisaged to partially replace the aligning aligned monolignol 19 21 and 23 radicals during subsequent template polymerization e.g. on the lignin backbone Chen and Sarkanen 2003 Davin and Lewis 2005 . Alternatively the p hydroxycinnamaldehydes 14 16 and 18 can participate in a proteinaceous guided assembly stage to a limited extent thereby forming the primary chains for subsequent replication. Furthermore because of the extended conjugation with the p hydroxycinnamaldehydic end group the proton at carbon 8 is more readily abstracted thereby affording the corresponding styryl O aryl ether products 8 O 4 inter unit linkages substructure VII 1 4 and rather than the typical 8 O 4 inter unit linkages in substructure I . Yet this process apparently can only continue up to about the equivalent of 50 lignin deposition relative to WT which corresponds to ca 36 of monomer cleavable 8 O 4 inter unit linkages in the lignins proper.

Interestingly the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde derived monomers released also had significantly higher levels of sinapyl aldehyde 18 derived moieties relative to that in the WT line although the reasons for this are as yet unknown.

Thus whether aborting this process in the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde CAD double mutant reflects the organism s perception of the structural imperfections resulting from deficits in cell wall macromolecular lignin configuration proper and or through some form of feedback inhibition transcriptional control within the cells cannot yet be gauged at this point. We interpret these data as most likely indicating however that the template polymerization process is a highly restricted attempt to use p hydroxycinnamaldehydes to preserve native lignin configuration i.e. which continues briefly until the failure checkpoint level is reached. It is evident however that there is no seamless replacement of monolignol monomers 19 21 and 23 and that the CAD double mutant has a significantly compromised structural integrity. Hence this may simply reflect the organism attempting in a limited way to form a biopolymer with the same inter unit lignin linkages as lignins proper i.e. through limited monomer degeneracy during template chain replication as described above. On the other hand the failure to complete this process and the structural deficits introduced again underscore the strong selection pressure that terrestrial vascular plants have evolved to afford lignins proper and not the structurally inferior poly p hydroxycinnamaldehydes noted herein.

Fourthly recent studies by Eudes et al. 2006 examined various WT and knockout lines of other putative members of the AtCAD gene family i.e. AtCAD1 3 and AtCAD6 9 whose precise physiological roles still await to be determined Kim et al. 2007 . Interestingly these researchers had reported that the various plant stem samples were considered to be analyzed at maturity. On the other hand the Klason lignin values reported for the mature stems see symbol black triangles for WT and gray triangles for cad mutants had values ranging from 15.4 to 20.3 . When these data were next plotted herein against the amounts of monolignol releasable components for each line as above together with our own data the trends observed were in agreement with the observations made above. It appeared that the plant lines in the Eudes et al. 2006 study were thus harvested at varying stages of growth development with only a few at maturation. Nevertheless at least for the Klason lignin determinations corresponded fairly closely to that of our modified AcBr lignin polyphenol analyses. More importantly it was quite striking that similar trends for all sets of data were evident for the monolignol derived cleavable 8 O 4 inter unit linkage frequencies when plotted in this manner i.e. in terms of both displacement of the abscissa and in amounts of monolignol derived moieties being released. These data thus again underscore the necessity in examining plant lines at various stages of growth and development rather than the single point analyses that have generally become routine for many investigations in this field.

NMR spectroscopic analyses of the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde enriched isolates and comparison to lignins proper. The application of NMR spectroscopy as for the alkaline NBO and thioacidolysis degradation analyses provided useful albeit still incomplete structural information for the isolates examined. This is because the current limitations of NMR spectroscopic analyses include the inability to readily probe lignin primary structure as well as the inability to identify detect and accurately quantify all of the various inter unit linkages present for example there were various substructures tentatively identified in the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates herein unpublished observations which await full synthetic verification.

Assuming however that there is some limited capacity for monomer degeneracy during template polymerization then an attempted formation of the same inter unit linkages and frequency as for macromolecular lignin configuration might be anticipated i.e. to afford 8 O 4 8 5 linkages and others at least to the extent possible. That this has occurred was readily demonstrable at least for the 8 O 4 inter unit linkages which contained G G S G G S like and S S like bonds in amounts corresponding to those in lignins proper and also presumably for the 8 5 inter unit linkages as well. However this continued only to a relatively earlier stage 50 of phenolic deposition when compared to that of lignification proper as described above.

Interestingly various previous studies of both CAD down regulated tobacco and pine Ralph et al. 1997 Chabannes et al. 2001 had reported that the 8 5 benzofuran linkages substructures IX were absent Kim et al. 2003 . In the study herein however evidence for 8 5 linkage formation in the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates was readily obtained substructure IX . Indeed such structural motifs had previously been noted in various lignans e.g. compound 79 Yang et al. 1991 and further verification of their presence in the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates was also achieved by comparison of spectroscopic features with that of synthetic compound 80.

Applicants findings thus also substantially differ from that observed with the synthetic dehydropolymerizates obtained from coniferyl aldehyde 16 and coniferyl alcohol 21 whereby 8 5 linkages were readily detectable as substructures XIV and XV Kim et al. 2003 . The existence of the fully conjugated substructure IX in the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates and how they differ from the corresponding entities in synthetic dehydropolymerizates may in future provide additional insight into how the true lignin forming machinery is operative in planta. That is this may also provide insights into the processes that are occurring leading to oxidation of the 7 8 double bond when the aldehydes 14 16 and 18 are translocated into the cell wall s and the significance of same.

In further contrast to previous studies of CAD downregulated plants tobacco or pine Kim et al. 2003 as well as synthetic poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde dehydropolymerizates Connors et al. 1970 Russell et al. 2000 none of the 8 8 p hydroxycinnamaldehyde substructures XII and XIII could unambiguously be identified in the poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde isolates either. On the other hand excluding their near absence under the conditions employed several other putative aldehyde correlations were observed but which remain unassigned in the present study these will be the subject of future investigations. Additionally limitations in the application of the NMR spectroscopic analyses were such that the small levels of substructures II V could not be detected nor 8 1 diphenyl linkages etc. .

Summary of this Example. As regards this particular investigation there has been much discussion on the potential of modifying lignin contents and compositions for various purposes including optimizing carbon sequestration animal feed forage digestibility lumber properties and pulp paper manufacture plant material as a source of biofuels including ethanol . It was thus instructive to comprehensively examine the ecotype Wassilewskija double mutant cad 4 cad 5 cad c cad d Sibout et al. 2005 as regards effects on plant growth and development overall morphology vascular apparatus integrity biomechanical properties disruption of lignification proper as well as the chemical physical properties of the predominantly poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde formed in small amounts instead of lignin described herein . Taken together all of the findings above provide excellent insight as to why lignin formation involves monolignol and not poly p hydroxycinnamaldehyde polymerization. That is lignin macromolecular configuration proper was disrupted through formation of the non monolignol p hydroxycinnamaldehydes with the resulting highly restricted attempt at template polymerization leading to premature termination of cell wall macromolecular assembly process es . These findings further help explain why the 350 000 extant vascular plants form lignins from a very finite set of monolignol precursors to achieve the requisite structural physiological properties. Moreover it should be evident from this study that an understanding macromolecular lignin configuration i.e. in terms of determination of lignin primary structures and the precise mode of biochemical formation for each stage of its their deposition represents now urgent goal. The urgency for this is exemplified by the clear trends being noted in both lignin phenol deposition and the conserved inter unit frequencies in same. Finally the findings place further restrictions on random combinatorial chemistry coupling which are rationalized herein as a controlled template assembly with limited monomer degeneracy.
