This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 236 899 which was filed on Sep. 28 2005 now abandoned and entitled COMPACT WIRELESS BIOMETRIC MONITORING AND REAL TIME PROCESSING SYSTEM the entire contents of which application is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject invocation is being developed with government support under Contract No. NNC05CA65C awarded by NASA. The United States government may have certain rights in the innovation.

Diagnosis of ailments and treatment of disease often requires an analysis of biological signs obtained from a patient in the course of normal activity over a period of time. Personal health monitors are commonly employed to gather data related to a patients biometric data.

In general a personal health monitor is a device used to measure and record one or more clinical parameters of a patient for later transmission to the patient s physician or other health care provider. The personal health monitor may be used in a hospital or clinical setting as an adjunct to existing care. Additionally the personal health monitor may also be used by the patient outside care facilities e.g. at a patient s home . When used by a patient at home the patient operates the personal health monitor to record certain bodily clinical parameters. The personal health monitor can be used by the patient who has a condition requiring monitoring of one or more clinical parameters but who otherwise may not require the level of care such as provided by a hospital. Accordingly the personal health monitor provides potential savings in medical costs involved with a hospital stay.

For example continuously monitoring cardiac patients immediately following coronary attacks is important. Such is normally accomplished effectively in the coronary care unit of most hospitals where the patients are continuously monitored following heart attacks to detect arrhythmias of the heart for example monitoring and warning for ventricular arrhythmias which may lead to ventricular fibrillation and death. Through prompt recognition and treatment of such warnings related to ventricular arrhythmias in coronary care units the mortality rate of acute myocardial infarctions has been reduced considerably. In addition many post myocardial infarction cardiac patients continue to have frequent ventricular extra systoles after discharge from the hospital. Accordingly it is desired to continuously monitor the patient over a certain period of time and under varying conditions of stress to determine the effectiveness treatment which has been introduced such as the proper dosage of medication.

Constant monitoring of such patients after release from the hospital may be difficult because of the logistics involved and particularly since they can no longer be monitored closely as a group by direct wiring or close telemetry as commonly implemented in hospital settings. As a result various systems have been developed to attempt to monitor the ECG signals of out patients to thereby provide a diagnostic tool for additional treatment or variation of treatment for the patients as may be required. Accordingly there has been a persistent need to develop health monitoring systems and methods that can effectively alert medical personnel when a patient needs medical assistance.

Nevertheless such mobile units are typically spacious and difficult to set up and maintain. Moreover in general these units are not suitable for readily monitoring a plurality of biological signs and biometric conditions. In addition such systems lack flexibility during usage as they typically have fixed sensor types and configurations.

At the same time compatibility of such systems with various communication requirements and protocols can create further problems and increase costs. This can further hinder a quick response of the medical staff when health issues arise for an ambulatory patient who employs such monitors. Also with the current limits in resolution on existing biometric data acquisition modules the analysis of low magnitude and sometimes long duration biometric parameters e.g. EKG activity is typically hindered and or not possible. Such problem is further compounded due to gain amplifiers lack of operation flexibility wherein the gain amplifiers e.g. associated with sensors are commonly set for high exertion activity levels.

The present invention relates generally to transfer function control for a biometric monitoring system and to a related method.

One aspect of the invention provides a modular apparatus for acquiring biometric data. The modular apparatus may include circuitry operative to receive an input signal indicative of a biometric condition the circuitry being configured to process the input signal according to a transfer function thereof and to provide a corresponding processed input signal. A controller is configured to provide at least one control signal to the circuitry to programmatically modify the transfer function of the modular system to facilitate acquisition of the biometric data.

Another aspect of the invention provides a modular system for acquiring biometric data. The system includes means for amplifying an input signal indicative of a sensed biometric condition to provide an amplified signal. The system also includes means for processing the amplified signal to provide a computed value representative of the sensed biometric condition. The system also includes means for controlling a transfer function of at least the means for amplifying based on the computed value.

Yet another aspect of the invention provides a method for controlling at least one channel transfer function for a modular unit. The modular unit includes at least one channel configured to receive at least one input signal indicative of a sensed biometric condition. The method includes initializing at least one channel transfer function parameter for circuitry of the at least one channel. The at least one input signal is processed by the circuitry of the at least one channel. The at least one input signal is processed by the circuitry according to the at least one channel transfer function parameter. The processed input signal is further analyzed to determine an adjustment to the at least one transfer function parameter based on the processed input signal. The at least one channel transfer function parameter is dynamically adjusted based on the analyzed processed input signal being outside of expected operating parameters.

The system includes a plurality of modules. In the example of the system includes a master module and a plurality of other modular components and . Each of the respective modules can be programmed and or configured according to the intended use of the system . At least some of modular components and can be replaced inserted and or swapped for to achieve a desired aggregate function such as can include collection of biometric parameters control of desired therapy communication of data to and from the system or any combination thereof.

For example a clinician can determine a customized routine for acquisition of biometric data and or therapy. Based on the routine the clinician can determine which types of modules should be inserted into the system as the modular components . For instance the modular components and can be configured to acquire biometric data associated with a patient and the modular component can deliver a desired type of therapy e.g. electrical and or chemical .

By way of further example the modular component can measure one or more biometric parameters and or supply input that is representative of the status of a controlled process. The input can be provided to the master module or another module component such as can be configured to change one or more outputs for effecting control of the therapy process. For instance one or more of the modular components and can supply activation commands to a glucose pump in a patient s proximity such as when acquired data that pertains to blood sugar of a patient indicates a critical level. Similarly muscle tension can be employed as a biometric condition to be collected by a modular component and employed for delivery of chemical or electrical therapy to perform muscle relaxation by the same or a different modular component to a patient. The inputs and outputs of each of the modular component can be binary e.g. on or off and or analog assuming a continuous range of values.

Each of the respective modules can communicate over a data bus or backplane . For example the bus can enable communication between the master module and any of the other modules . Additionally or alternatively each of the modules can communicate with each other over the bus . Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate various types of buses or communication links and communications protocols that can be utilized to provide for communication between the respective modules .

The system can be considered a distributed computing arrangement since certain processing functions can be distributed to the respective modules . In this way computing power requirements of the master module can be reduced based upon the portions of processing being implemented at the respective components . In this respect the power usage of the system can be scaled to the medically desired configuration of the system. By way of further example each of the modules and can correspond to a modular apparatus that can be utilized to acquire biometric data that can be transmitted to the master module for aggregate communication to one or more clients such as a Personal Digital Assistant PDA computer workstation a server and the like.

In the example of the master module can include a bus controller that can be utilized to control data communication over the bus . For instance the bus controller can transmit data from the master module to the respective modular components through via the bus . As one example the master module can provide respective program instructions to one or more of the modules through for controlling operation and the particular function being performed by the respective module s . This can include setting one or more operating parameters as well as defining the specific functions being performed by the respective components. The bus controller can also control the rate at which each of the respective modules may communicate data over the bus . For example the bus controller can control rate at which data is sent from each of the respective modules to the master module e.g. corresponding to a data acquisition rate for the master module synchronously or asynchronously.

The master module also includes a processor that can execute program instructions stored in associated memory . For example the memory can store executable instructions that control high level functions of the bus controller to facilitate and optimize traffic over the bus . The processor can also control other functions associated with the system such as communication to one or more clients through a respective transceiver . The transceiver can be implemented as a wired or wireless type of communication device. Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate various types of transceivers that can be utilized to transmit and or receive data.

For instance the processor can transfer data from the memory to the associated client via the transceiver . Alternatively the client may be configured to access and download data from selected portions of the memory . For example the client can run an appropriate user interface not shown to initiate or terminate or otherwise control one or more functions associated with operation of the system .

The master module can also include a clock that is used to control timing associated with operation of the master module control the timing associated with data transfer over the bus via the bus controller . The master module can also employ the clock to control internal operation of the master module including communication via the transceiver . The transceiver further can be utilized for programming operation of the system through an appropriate input output port.

The memory can be implemented as including one or more different types of memory such as volatile or nonvolatile memory. The memory can be accessed by the processor for storing executable instructions for controlling operation of the master module and the system more generally. The memory can also be utilized to store data that is provided to the master module via the transceiver or bus controller . For example the memory can be utilized as a temporary data storage device for biometric data and control information that may be received from any of the other respective modules through via the bus .

The system can further include a data storage module that can be utilized for storing addition data that is transmitted over the bus . For example the processor can store data to the data storage module . Additionally or alternatively the data storage module can be implemented as a modular component similar to the other modules and in the system . For example a module having a desired memory capacity can be connected to the bus as the data storage module to increase the storage capacity of the system . This would allow the data storage function of the other the modular components and to be distributed to the data storage module further increasing the cost efficiency associated with such modules since such modules can be configured with reduced memory requirements. A client thus may be able to access and retrieve data from the data storage module via the master module through the transceiver processor and the bus controller and bus .

The client may also communicate with the data storage module or other modules and in the system by other communication devices. For example the system can include addition means of communicating to one or more external devices such as a communications module . For example the communication module can correspond to a wireless communication module. The wireless communication module for example can transmit according to any one of a variety of known wireless protocols such as an 802.11x standard Bluetooth cellular communications and the like.

Additionally or alternatively the system can include a network interface module that can be programmed and or configured to connect to a computer network such as a local area network LAN or a wide area network WAN such as the internet. As one example the network interface module can be electrically connected to the network via a standard network connection. The network interface module thus can provide an appropriate connection with the desired network. Thus in the example of communications can be implemented over the bus via the bus controller over the bus through the network interface module and over the bus via the communication module . In this way data can be transmitted to and received from the system via the network interface module .

In the example of the modular components and can be programmed and or configured based on the requirements of the biometric condition s that is to be measured and or other functions that are to be controlled such as including the administration of a desired therapy. Each of the respective components and can includes a common architecture which corresponds to circuitry referred to herein as a common data controller CDC and . As one example each of the CDCs and can be a common architecture that includes a processor or controller and other circuitry that is configured to control operation of the modular component as well as facilitate communication to and from the respective modular component via the bus .

Each of the modular components and also includes modality specific circuitry and . The modality specific circuitry can vary according to the type of biometric condition data that is to be acquired by a respective module and or the type of therapy that might be delivered by the respective module. That is the modality specific circuitry and of each of the modules and is programmed and or configured to perform a predetermined biometric function e.g. sensing or therapeutic function a k a modality . For instance one or more of the modules and can be configured to acquire a predetermined type of biometric condition data by sensing biometric or biological conditions of a patient. By way of further example each of the modality specific circuitry and can be adapted to acquire data related to the modalities of electromyography EMG electrocardiography ECG electroencephalography EEG plantar pressure joining angle pulse oximetry blood pressure core body temperature blood glucose and the like. Additionally or alternatively one or more other modules and can be configured to administer a desired therapy e.g. electrical or chemical therapies .

Thus each of the modality specific circuitry and includes circuitry operative to receive an input signal indicative of a biometric condition. As described herein such input signal indicative of the biometric condition can correspond to a signal representing a sensed biometric condition of the patient. Alternatively in other circumstances the input signal can be a signal e.g. feedback signal associated with a delivery of a therapy to the patient such as may be in the from of chemical or electrical therapies.

Advantageously the particular combination of data acquisition and or therapy administration thus can be tailored on a patient by patient basis by interchanging or swapping various modular components having different modality specific circuitry into or out of the system . As described herein each of the modular components can have a form factor which may be a standard or proprietary form factor which is dimensioned and configured for swappable connection into the system. Thus as the intended use of the system changes different modules can be replaced or swapped for other modules so that the aggregate system meets the needs for particular patient. For example the respective connections between the modules and the bus are schematically represented as bi directional arrows. Such connections enable data communication from a given one of the respective modules to one or more other modules over the bus such as under the control of the bus controller in the master module . Additionally the connections can provide power to each of the respective modules . For instance a power source such as including a voltage regulator and one or more batteries can distribute power to each of the respective modules via the bus . Alternative power systems can be utilized to provide power such as may be implemented by separate power connection or in one or more of modules .

Each of the modular components and whether it is sensing biometric condition of a patient or controlling delivery of a therapy operates according to a transfer function. The transfer function of the modular component can be derived as the aggregate e.g. by convolution of transfer functions for circuitry that forms each of the modular components. For instance each channel of the modality specific circuitry and can include several different circuit components each having a unique component transfer function which collectively determines the channel transfer function for a respective channel of the modality specificity circuitry. Moreover a given modular component can include a plurality of channels each of which channels can be represented as a separate channel transfer function. Each of the channel transfer functions can be adjusted dynamically to improve performance such as by adjusting one or more component transfer functions.

By way of example a given channel of a modality specific circuit and can include an analog input circuit configured to process a received input signal according to an associated transfer function and to provide a corresponding processed input signal. The modality specific circuit can include additional filtering and amplifier stages which also can be represented as respective transfer functions and provide amplified and filtered output signals according to their respective transfer functions. Additionally conversion to a digital signal and subsequent digital processing stages can also be represented by corresponding transfer functions. Thus the transfer function associated with the different stages or circuit parts in the modality specific circuitry cooperate to define the plant transfer function for each channel and each modular component as a whole.

The CDC and is configured to provide one or more control signals to the modality specific circuitry and respectively to modify the transfer function characteristics of the modular component. For instance each CDC and can dynamically modify the transfer function associated with each given channel of the respective modality specific circuitry. As one example the CDC can adjust the transfer function for a given channel so that a maximum resolution of the sensor can be achieved according to the dynamic range of the circuitry.

By way of further example each CDC can include a register not shown that is configured for storing a digital value representing the corresponding input signal that has been processed by the modality specific circuitry. The CDC can adjust the transfer function of the modality specific circuitry such that the maximum resolution of the sensor can be represented with maximum number of bits available in the register. In this way the biometric condition data can be acquired with a substantially maximum resolution according to dynamic range of the data acquisition circuitry and the available register memory in which the data is stored. For instance the CDC can adjust the transfer function by changing the gain or one or more amplifiers of the modality specific circuitry so that the signal value that is accommodated in the register with a substantially maximum resolution according to the dynamic range of the circuitry.

For purposes of consistency in the example of each of the respective ports and is illustrated as a corresponding sensor input port that can receive a sensor input signal such as from an associated sensor not shown . The characteristics e.g. frequency and amplitude of the input signal received at and thus can vary according to the type of biometric condition being sensed. The modality specific circuitry includes corresponding analog input circuitry and that is associated with each input port for providing isolation and analog pre processing the respective input signal. Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate various types of input circuits e.g. isolation amplifiers that can be utilized to receive signals from appropriate sensors and provide corresponding input signals. The input circuitry and in the modality specific circuitry thus can vary according to the modality and the biometric conditions intended to be monitored by the modular apparatus . Alternatively the analog circuitry and might correspond to output or control circuitry e.g. drivers configured to control delivery of appropriate therapies such as a chemical or electrical based therapies. The analog circuitry and further can provide for isolation between the leads and sensors connected as the ports and and the other processing performed by the modality specific circuitry .

Each of the circuits and provides corresponding analog outputs signals to filter networks and respectively. In the example of the filter network includes a filter block and an amplifier block and the filtered network includes a filter block and amplifier block . It should be understood and appreciated that each of the respective filters and can include any number of one or more filters that can be represented as a corresponding transfer function with poles and zeros and respective filter coefficients. Additionally each of the amplifiers and can include any number of one or more amplifiers that can be represented by a corresponding transfer function that represent the gain implemented by the amplifiers. Additionally while the schematic depiction of the filter networks and shows a filter stage followed by an amplifier stage there can be various arrangements orders and combinations of amplifier and filter stages to provide the filter networks.

The filter network and can be programmable such as based on control signals from the CDC . For example the filter coefficients of the filter blocks and can be programmed. Additionally or alternatively the gain of the respective amplifiers and can be programmed. That is the amplifier block and can be implemented as programmable gain amplifiers. The filter networks and that can perform associated filtering and amplification of the analog input signals from the analog input circuitry and and provide corresponding filtered and amplified signals to an analog to digital converter ADC . As one example the ADC can be implemented as a Sigma Delta ADC that operates on each of the respective channels to provide a corresponding high resolution digital representation of the filtered and amplified signals. Thus the ADC provides a corresponding digital output signal for each respective channel of the modality specific circuitry .

The respective digital outputs for each channel are provided to a digital signal processor DSP . The digital outputs can be provided as separate connections e.g. parallel outputs of the ADC or the digital output can be provided via a corresponding bus or other communication link. The DSP is connected with memory . For example the memory can contain executable instructions that cause the DSP to compute a predetermined function on the digital representation for each of the filter and amplified channel inputs. The respective function can be a linear function or a nonlinear function according to the type and content of the data received at the respective inputs and . The function computed by the DSP for each channel of the apparatus for example can be determined according to the transfer function associated with each respective channel of the apparatus of the modular apparatus . Thus the functions being computed by the DSP for each channel of the apparatus can be the same or different. The DSP provides corresponding computed values as outputs to the CDC . The CDC can also control the function computed by the DSP or other operations of the DSP such as by providing program instructions that can be stored in the memory . For example the CDC can modify the functions at run time such as during normal operation or during a programming mode of the modular apparatus .

For example the CDC can provide one or more control signals to each of the filter networks and to adjust the transfer function associated with each respective channel. The CDC can adjust gain according to the dynamic range of each respective channel and the associated data acquisition device. As mentioned above the transfer function associated with a given channel can include a representation of operating characteristics associated with the circuitry or as well as the respective filter network and . The transfer function of a channel can also represent operation of the ADC e.g. the latency through the sigma delta modulator as well as include poles and or zeros representing the signal processing performed by the DSP . The respective components of each individual channel transfer function thus can be convolved to provide an aggregate transfer function channel H such as follows 

where Hthrough Hrepresent the individual component channel transfer function components of the different portions of the modality specific circuitry.

The CDC thus can provide one or more control signals to the filter networks and to adjust the transfer function and thereby establish a desired dynamic range for each respective channel. As a further example the channel transfer function can be estimated a priori based on the configuration of the modality specific H circuitry and the intended of such circuitry. The channel transfer function H for a given channel of the system can be determined to provide a highest available dynamic range for a given modality. For example the form of respective transfer function can be derived via appropriate simulation device e.g. matlab . The transfer function can be programmed into the CDC which can be further adjusted dynamically during operation such as by adjusting respective filter coefficients and gain in the analog domain via control signal provided to the respective filter network and . Additionally and alternatively the CDC can adjust the transfer function in the digital domain e.g. such as by programming the operation of the DSP .

By way of further example the CDC can include a filter control block that is programmed and or configured to set one or more filter coefficients associated with each of the filter networks and of the apparatus . Filter control can provide the respective control signals through the corresponding digital to analog converters indicated at and to set respective coefficients of the respective filter blocks and . The filter coefficients can be selectively adjusted during operation to optimize the respective filter function based on the filter control implemented by the CDC . The respective filter coefficients can be adjusted as a function of outputs computed by the DSP for each of the respective channels. As one example the coefficients associated with the filter networks or can be adjusted based on the operation of the channel which further can vary according to biometric condition being monitored. The adjustments can be made dynamically based on the instantaneous DSP output or based on multiple DSP output samples acquired over a period of time e.g. time averaged representation of the channel data . Alternatively or additionally the filter control can adjust filter coefficients for each channel based on the relative values of DSP outputs for a plurality of channels.

The CDC can also include an amplifier control block that is programmed and or configured to provide a control signal for setting the gain of each of the respective amplifiers and associated with each respective channel. For example the amplifier control block can provide a gain value that is converted to a corresponding analog gain value by a corresponding digital to analog converters and . The digital to analog converters and can provide corresponding gain for values having respective voltage levels adjusting the gain of the respective amplifiers and . As one example the amplifier control block can set the respective gain for each respective channel in the modular apparatus to achieve a maximum dynamic range of the data acquisition circuitry.

As mentioned above the initial transfer function for each respective channel in the modular apparatus can be predetermined and programmed in the CDC . The CDC can employ the filter control and amplifier control to adjust the initial transfer function for increased efficiency and higher dynamic range for each of the respective channels in its operating environment. The transfer function for the modular apparatus can vary according to the modality e.g. type of sensor or therapy dispensing function associated with the modality specific circuitry . The filter coefficients and gain can be adjusted as discrete or continuous increments or decrements over a range of available settings. Additionally the particular modality can be modified programmatically by the CDC if necessary and a new transfer function can be programmed at the CDC such as via the data bus programmed by a master module as described herein.

The transfer function can be programmed via the bus. Additionally or alternatively a set of base transfer functions parameters can be programmed in memory e.g. as a look up table of the CDC . For example at start up a particular transfer function can be selected and set for each of the respective channels such as based upon the function or purpose associated with the modality specific circuitry and the status of the device . As mentioned above each of the respective channels can have an initial starting transfer function that may be the same or different. As one example it may be desirable during operation to replace leads or sensors for a given modality specific circuitry with a different type of lead or sensor. In such a situation the filter control and amplifier control of the CDC can detect the variations in the received input signal from the DSP for the respective channel s and in turn implement appropriate changes to the transfer function such as via adjustments to filter coefficients and or the gain for the respective channel.

It will be appreciated that the functionality of DSP and CDC while shown and described as being implemented by separate circuitry can be integrated in single processor or an application specific circuit ASIC that can be programmed and configured to perform the combined functions. Those skilled in the art will further understand and appreciate that various implementations of modality specific circuitry that can also be integrated with one or both of the CDC and the DSP.

In the example of the given channel receives an input signal indicative of a conditions condition. The input signal for instance can be provided from a specially configured sensor via an electrical path e.g. including a lead to a programmable gain amplifier . The electrical path may also include other input circuitry e.g. an analog isolation amplifier which has been omitted from for purposes of clarity. The programmable gain amplifier receives the input and provides a corresponding amplified output signal to other circuitry . For example the other circuitry can include additional analog amplifiers as well as filtering circuitry such as described herein. The other circuitry also includes circuitry configured to perform analog to digital conversion on the amplified input signal. As described herein analog to digital conversion can be performed by conversion to provide a corresponding high resolution digital output. While the example of is shown and described in relation to a single channel those skilled in the art will understand that a give modular apparatus can include appropriate circuitry for implementing transfer function control with respect to any number of one or more channels.

The corresponding digital representation of the amplified signal can be provided to a corresponding signal processor such as a DSP . The DSP is programmed and configured to compute a function from the digital representation provided by the other circuitry . The value of the computed function is provided to the transfer function control block . The transfer function control for example can include a register configured and arranged for storing a predetermined number of bits. The register can be implemented in a separate register or in other types of memory configured for storing the digital value in a predetermined number of bits e.g. in a predefined address space of RAM . As an example one portion of the memory block such as the least significant bits LSB indicated at can have a word length or number of bits designed for accommodating the DSP output. Another portion of the register such as one or more of the most significant buts MSB indicated at can be utilized for storing overflow bits s . The transfer function control can employ the overflow bit s for determining adjustments to the transfer function.

A dynamic range control block thus can be configured to control changes to the channel transfer function based on the compound value stored in the register . As one example the dynamic range control can increment or decrement a gain value based on the value in the overflow data block . For instance if the overflow data indicates that the computed value provided by the DSP indicates that available register space has been exceeded the dynamic range control can decrement the gain value accordingly. In contrast if the overflow data is not indicative of the output of the DSP not filling the available space in the register the dynamic range control can cause an increase in the gain value . To mitigate fluctuations the dynamic range control can implement adjustments based on a time averaged value of the MSB .

The gain value can be converted to a corresponding analog signal via a digital to analog converter DAC that is utilized to program and set the gain of the programmable gain amplifier . For example the analog output provided by the DAC can correspond to a gain factor that produces an increase or decrease in resolution of the input. The gain factor can be a continuous value or a selected set of discrete values e.g. voltages which further may vary according to the configuration of the programmable gain amplifier .

From the foregoing it will be appreciated that the transfer function control loop can operate to set the gain as to maximize the dynamic range of the date acquisition sensor that provides the input to the programmable gain amplifier . The transfer function control can implement this process e.g. adjustments to the channel transfer function during a calibration phase such as may occur at power up or reset. Alternatively or additionally the transfer function control can adjust the transfer function during normal operation such as based on detecting variations in the value computed by the DSP outside of expected operation parameters.

Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a similar control loop can be utilized to set filter coefficients or other transfer function parameters based on the discussion contained herein. Such transfer function controls can be programmed in a CDC or other portion of the modular apparatus e.g. the apparatus of . Additionally those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that each respective active channel in a modular apparatus can implement a similar transfer function control to adjust the respective channel transfer function including gain and filter coefficients associated with each transfer function. The particular controls further can vary according to the modality and biometric conditions being monitored or therapy being delivered by the modular apparatus.

The control system can implement instructions for implementing such control features based on instructions stored in associated memory . The memory can include non volatile memory and or volatile memory for storing appropriate executable instructions. Thus the control system may comprise a processor or control logic not shown for executing such instructions. The CDC can also include a bus interface that is utilized for transmitting and receiving data via an associated data bus . The data bus for example can be implemented as a backplane for communicating data relative to and or from the CDC and one or more other modules or devices not shown but see e.g. that may be connected the bus . The bus interface thus is configured to facilitate such communication such as having an input queue for receiving data from the bus and an output queue for transmitting data over the bus . Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate various communication protocols and bus architectures that can be utilized.

For data to be transmitted over the bus for example the memory can include a FIFO or other data structure that can be utilized for storing data from the modality specific circuitry. Such data in the FIFO can include calibration data associated with operation of the modular apparatus as well as biometric data acquired from one or more channels of the modality specific circuitry . As the FIFO or other data structure receives and is filled with data from the modality specific circuitry the stored data can then be transmitted via the bus to an associated destination module such as a master module in the modular system.

Since each modular apparatus can be employed to acquire a different type of modular apparatus the FIFO in the memory may fill at different rate relative to a corresponding FIFO in a different modular apparatus. To accommodate such potentially varying acquisition rates each FIFO can be configured to a memory size according to the type of modality e.g. which defines its acquisition rate . A bus controller not shown can control the rate at which each modular apparatus transmits and receives data via the bus in an asynchronous manner.

The CDC further can include a clock for controlling the timing of operation within the modular apparatus including the CDC and the modality specific circuitry. Alternatively or additionally the modality specific circuitry can include its own clock for synchronizing timing of data acquisition from one or more acquisitions.

Each of the modular apparatuses further can include one or more channels for acquiring and processing input signals indicative of corresponding biometric conditions. Each channel of each modular apparatus for example has a transfer function that can be adjusted independently such as described herein to achieve a desired dynamic range for data acquisition at a corresponding resolution. Additionally different modular apparatuses having different sensor requirements can acquire data at different sample. For instance asynchronous data collection can be implemented across modular apparatuses while at the same time employing a synchronous clock within each modular apparatus to provide timing on module for data collection functions.

In such a distributed system one or more I O modules are provided for interfacing with a process wherein the outputs derive their control or output values in the form of a message from a master controller over the bus . For example a modular component can receive an output value from a processor via a communications network or a backplane communications bus. The desired output value for controlling a device associated with a given biometric condition can be generally sent to the output module in a message such as an I O message. The modular component that receives such a message can provide a corresponding output analog or digital to the controlled process. The modular component can also measure a value of a process variable and report the input values to a master controller or peer modular component over the network or backplane . The input values may be used by the master module for performing control computations.

In the example of the modular apparatus includes a plurality of programmable gain amplifiers that receive respective channel inputs. The channel inputs further can go through additional analog circuitry not shown such as including filters and isolation amplifiers. The programmable gain amplifiers provide corresponding amplified input signals to an ADC filter block . The ADC filter block converts the amplified inputs signals into corresponding digital representations such as described herein. The ADC filter block provides the digital channel representation and provides the computed value to a CDC .

As described herein each channel has a respective transfer function that can be adjusted. The CDC can provide a control signal for adjusting one or more parameters of each channel transfer function. For example the CDC performs transfer function control processes to adjust each channel transfer function dynamically such as to achieve a maximum dynamic range. The CDC thus provides a control signal to each of the programmable gain amplifiers to adjust the gain according to the transfer function control performed on the computed value from the DSP . In addition each channel can be individually configurable by the CDC such as from 10 Hz sample rate with a total maximum data throughput exceeding 32 kHz. Each channel thus can be provided with a desired dynamic range and operating frequency. Additionally as described herein each channel can have an individual set of programmable filters e.g. programmable by the CDC to allow for improved filtering and overall performance.

In view of the structural and functional features described above certain methods will be better appreciated with reference to . It is to be understood and appreciated that the illustrated actions in other embodiments may occur in different orders or concurrently with other actions. Moreover not all features illustrated in may be required to implement a method according to the subject invention. It is to be further understood that the following methodology can be implemented in hardware e.g. one or more processors such as in a computer or computers or in a biomedical device software e.g. stored in a computer readable medium or as executable instructions running on one or more processors or as a combination of hardware and software.

At a received input signal can be appropriately filtered to remove noise from the signal and other unwanted signal components. The filtering can be defined by programmable filter coefficients. At the input signal is amplified by a programmable gain amplifier according to the gain value of the amplifier. The amplifier can include one or more gain stages each of which may have a programmable gain.

At the filtered and amplified signal is converted to a corresponding digital signal. For instance the conversion can be implemented by a analog to digital converter to provide a high resolution digital output. At the digital output can be processed e.g. by a DSP to provide an output value according to a predefined function. The function can be derived based on the transfer function determined for the channel. At the computed output value can be evaluated to ascertain what adjustments if any are to be made to the channel transfer function. For instance if the bit length of the computed output value exceeds a predefined number of bits the gain can be increased. If the bit length is less than a minimum bit length the gain may be increased. The computed output value can also be analyzed relative to predetermined data e.g. in a look up table in memory of the CDC to determine changes to filter coefficients. At the transfer function can be updated based on the analysis at .

From the method can return to to continue the process such that the transfer function can be dynamically adjusted such as to maintain a maximum dynamic range for circuitry associated with the input channel. It will be appreciated that during normal operation the process may repeat periodically at a predefined timing interval. Alternatively the CDC may routinely monitor parameters and trigger adjustments when such parameters are outside of expected operating parameters.
