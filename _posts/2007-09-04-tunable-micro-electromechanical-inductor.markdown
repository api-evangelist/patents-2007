Micro electro mechanical devices MEMS attract large attention in many fields of application that include the wireless automotive and biomedical industries. Reliable RF MEMS devices have been fabricated utilizing electrostatic and thermal actuation schemes.

The design of microwave and millimeter wave electronics requires components that provide a capability for impedance matching and or tuning. Impedance matching is the process through which signals are made to propagate through a high frequency network with a specific amount of reflection typically as low as possible.

Two of the most common types of components used for impedance matching are capacitors and inductors. Radio frequency micro electromechanical RF MEMS techniques have in the past been used to fabricate state of the art tunable capacitors in a variety of different forms. However to date much less progress has been made in developing RF MEMS tunable inductors.

Prior art in tunable inductors of the RF MEMS type basically consist of topologies in which RF MEMS switches are used to select between different tuning states. Inductors are integral components in RF front end architectures that include filters matching networks and tunable circuits such as phase shifters. The most common inductor topologies include planar spirals aircore and embedded solenoid designs. In comparison to capacitors however relatively few tunable inductor configurations have been published among those presented many are hybrid approaches that employ MEMS switches to activate different static inductive sections. Furthermore less attention has been paid to designs that enable control in the sub nH range as is potentially desirable for matching purposes in applications that use distributed loading of small capacitances e.g. in loaded line phase shifters.

Nanocrystalline diamond NCD possesses many outstanding material properties such as high thermal conductivity high stiffness low thermal expansion coefficient and its chemical inertness prevents from oxidation up to 600 C. in vacuum . These properties of NCD films can be used for high temperature and high power RF MEMS devices. Furthermore NCD films also possess low loss when used as a thin film at microwave frequencies.

The present invention provides a distributed tunable inductor using DC contact MEMS switches. A high inductance value is realized using a small length of high impedance line while a low inductance is realized by reconfiguring the same circuit to yield a low impedance line using DC contact switches.

In accordance with the present invention a tunable radio frequency microelectromechanical inductor is provided. The tunable inductor includes a coplanar waveguide having a center conductor and two spaced apart ground conductors the center conductor being positioned between the two spaced apart ground conductors and the center conductor further including a narrow width inductive section. The RF MEMS inductor further includes at least one direct current actuatable contact switch positioned to vary the effective width of the narrow inductive section of the center conductor upon actuation of the at least one contact switch and a direct current bias line positioned to actuate the at least one actuatable contact switch.

A high inductance value is realized using a small length of high impedance line which is provided by the narrow width inductive section of the center conductor. In a specific embodiment this narrow width inductive section is of uniform width over the length of the small length section. In an additional embodiment the center conductor is a meandered center conductor over the length of the narrow width section thereby increasing the inductance ratio of the device.

In accordance with the present invention the actuatable contact switch is in contact at one end with the center conductor and suspended above the coplanar waveguide bordering the narrow inductive section of the center conductor such that upon actuation the contact switch increases the effective width of the narrow inductive section which in turn narrows the slot width between the center conductor and the ground conductor resulting in a lower inductance value along the transmission line. Alternatively the actuatable contact switch may be positioned on either or both of the ground conductors of the coplanar waveguide.

In a specific embodiment the actuatable contact switch of the tunable inductor is a cantilever beam. The cantilever beam is positioned with one end in contact with the wider portion of the center conductor at one end of the narrow width section through a standoff post and then suspended over the length of the narrow width section with the other end of the cantilever positioned to make contact with the wider portion of the center conductor at the opposite end of the narrow section. Upon application of the DC bias to the DC bias line positioned below the cantilever beam the cantilever beam is actuated thereby bridging across the narrow section of the center conductor and increasing the effective width of the narrow section.

While many dimensions of the tunable RF MEMS inductor are within the scope of the present invention in a particular embodiment the cantilever beam has a width of approximately 50 m and the narrow width section of the center conductor is approximately 600 m.

To provide the DC bias to actuate the switches a SiCr bias line passes through a cut made in the ground plane of the ground conductors and under the actuatable switch. To reestablish the connectivity between the two split sections of the ground conductors resulting from the cut a thin wire bond or an air bridge is provided.

In a particular embodiment a plurality of direct current actuatable contact switches are provided and in a preferred embodiment an actuatable contact switch is positioned on each side of the narrow width inductive section of the center conductor.

In an additional embodiment of the invention a thermally actuated diamond micro bridge is presented. The diamond bridges are used to realize RF switches in the microstrip and CPW topology. As such an electrically actuated NCD bridge utilizing high power RF is provided.

In accordance with the present invention is provided a tunable RF MEMS inductor in which the tuning functionality is directly integrated into the inductor itself. The resulting inductor is compact in size provides very fine resolution in its tuning states and can be applied in a variety of different circuit applications. These applications include but are not limited to true time delay phase shifters impedance matching networks for amplifiers and tuning networks for couplers and filters.

Coplanar waveguide CPW transmission lines are known in the art. With reference to a CPW transmission line consists of a center conductor positioned between two ground conductors . The physical parameters that affect the impedance of a CPW transmission line are the conductor width W slot width S dielectric constant of the substrate and the thickness H of the substrate . For a given dielectric constant and the substrate thickness a narrow width center conductor and a wide slot width result in high impedance. On the contrary wide center conductor and a narrow slot width results in low impedance.

With reference to in accordance with the present invention a short length of high impedance CPW transmission line is designed to emulate an inductor. In a particular embodiment the short length is approximately less than or equal to one quarter wavelength 4. As such in accordance with the present invention a digital type tuning of the transmission line inductor is made possible by changing the effective width of the center conductor and the slot width using DC contact switches .

In a first embodiment a tunable inductor with DC contact switches on the center conductor of a CPW transmission line is described. With reference to is shown an illustrative view of the tunable inductor in accordance with the present invention. The DC contact switches are located on the center conductor and suspended above the CPW structure . In a particular embodiment the switches are suspended approximately 2 m above the CPW structure . When the switches are in the non actuated state the effective impedance of the microelectromechanical MEM section is high narrow W and wide S thereby resulting in a high inductance. Furthermore when the switches are actuated the effective impedance of the MEM section is low wide W and narrow S thereby providing a low inductance. In this embodiment the width of the narrow section of the center conductor is varied by actuation of the switches . Actuation of the switches is accomplished by the placement of DC bias lines through the ground plane . A cut in the ground plane is provided to minimize signal leakage. The two split ground sections of ground plane are separated by a cut and reconnected through the use of a thin wire bond .

In a particular embodiment the distributed tunable inductor is designed to operate from 5 30 GHz using DC contact MEMS switches on a 500 m thick quartz substrate. A high inductance value is realized using a small length of high impedance line while a low inductance is realized by reconfiguring the same circuit to yield a low impedance line using DC contact switches. In a specific embodiment cantilever beams are used as series type DC contact switches suspended on 1.5 m thick posts that are located on the center conductor . When the beams are in the non actuated state the signal is carried only on the thin center conductor of the CPW line and a high value of characteristic impedance is obtained. Since the length of the narrow section is electrically small the topology effectively emulates an inductor with high inductance value. Similarly when the beams make contact the effective width of the center conductor increases and the characteristic impedance with respect to the high impedance state is less correspondingly this represents a low inductance state. The inductance ratio is directly related to the change in the impedance states.

The extracted inductance versus frequency in both states actuated and non actuated is shown in . It is seen from this figure that the inductance ratio inductance in the high impedance state with respect to the inductance in the low impedance state is approximately 1.8 at 30 GHz.

In an additional embodiment the switch is a thermally actuated nanocrystalline diamond micro bridge. The diamond micro bridge allows for RF and high power applications.

With reference to the design and fabrication of the nanocrystalline diamond bridges includes depositing a nanocrystalline diamond film onto a low resistive silicon substrate by hot filament chemical vapor deposition HFCVD . In a specific embodiment the diamond bridge is 1200 m long and 300 m wide. The bridges are thermally actuated using a bi metal actuation scheme. The diamond bridge is made of doped diamond onto which bi metal copper lines are deposited. As the thermal expansion of copper is higher than that of diamond resistive heating of the doped areas forces a bending of the beam and hence switching into the actuated state. The pull in voltage and current to switch the bridge depends on the geometry of the diamond heating elements.

In a specific embodiment fabrication of the diamond bridges onto a 500 m thick low resistive silicon wafer includes 

1. The silicon wafer is nucleated by BEN bias enhanced nucleation and an intrinsic diamond layer of 1500 in thickness is grown through a microwave plasma assisted CVD process. Boron doped diamond p type is later grown with HFCVD hot filament CVD to a thickness of 8500 . This boron doped diamond is the heart of the micromachined actuator.

2. Intrinsic diamond is selectively grown using a SiOmask. The 4000 thick diamond layer is used for electrical isolation of the contact areas while actuating the bridges.

3. A Cr Au seed layer of 700 is deposited using an ion beam reactor following which a 1 m thick copper film is deposited by electroplating which serves as the bi metal for thermal actuation.

4. Copper pads which are used to integrate the diamond switches onto the host substrate are electroplated to a thickness of 12 m. The RF contact areas are also formed by electroplating in this step.

5. The previously deposited seed layer is patterned to provide electrical continuity to actuate the bridges.

8. Finally using patterned silicon dioxide as a backside hard mask diamond structures are released from the silicon wafer through a DRIE process resulting in a free standing diamond bridge that is embedded in a silicon frame .

The diamond bridges are then flip chip bonded to the host substrate using a Cu Sn solder process SOLID solid state interdiffusion . Coplanar waveguide CPW and microstrip circuits are gold electroplated on a 650 m thick alumina substrate. is a microphotograph of the fabricated diamond actuator in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment the overall size of the entire chip is 1600 m long and 900 m wide.

In accordance with the present invention the diamond air bridges are integrated on an alumina substrate to realize an RF switch in the CPW and microstrip topology. Planar inductors are also realized in the CPW topology using these diamond bridges.

In a specific embodiment the CPW transmission lines are designed on a 650 m thick alumina substrate. The transmission lines are 3000 m long with a center conductor width W of 100 m and slot width G of 50 m. The center conductor of these lines is purposefully interrupted in the middle resulting in two transmission lines which are 1475 m long during actuation the contact pad in the diamond bridge closes this gap.

With reference to in an additional embodiment the diamond bridges are utilized to realize tunable inductors wherein the non actuated and actuated sate of the bridges yield different net inductance values. In this embodiment the inductor circuits fabricated on the alumina substrate are 400 m long. illustrates the inductor layout along with the integrated diamond bridge . The difference in inductance is due to the change in impedance of the device due to the varying widths of W and G.

Accordingly the present invention provides a planar MEMS tunable inductor utilizing series cantilever beams that are DC contact type switches to vary the effective width of a CPW center conductor.
