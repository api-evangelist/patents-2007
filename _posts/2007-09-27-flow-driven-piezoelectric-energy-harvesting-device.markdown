The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates in general to electric power generators and in particular to piezoelectric power generators.

Many weapons require an electrical pulse to initiate their explosive fire train. The electrical pulse is typically provided by electrical energy stored in the weapon s fuze. Batteries are one method to store electrical energy. Batteries however are heavy expensive and have a limited shelf life. Conventional technologies disclose the use of piezoelectric films that are strained during setback acceleration to generate electricity. Because of the relatively short duration of setback acceleration the amount of energy that can be generated during setback is limited. In addition some weapons do not experience setback acceleration. Thus there is a need for an electric power generator that is small and lightweight enough to fit in a weapon fuze yet able to generate sufficient energy to initiate an explosive fire train.

It is an object of the invention to provide a fluid driven electric power source in particular for a fuze for a weapon.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus including a fluid flow driven impeller including at least one impact arm and at least one cantilevered beam disposed such that the impact arm strikes the cantilevered beam as the impeller rotates the cantilevered beam at least partially including a piezoelectric film.

Another aspect of the invention is a method including rotating an impeller having at least one impact arm and striking at least one cantilevered beam with the impact arm as the impeller rotates the cantilevered beam at least partially comprising a piezoelectric film.

A further aspect of the invention is an apparatus including a fluid flow driven impeller having at least one flexible vane at least partially comprising a piezoelectric film. The apparatus may further comprise at least one rigid impact arm disposed such that the at least one flexible vane strikes the rigid impact arm as the impeller rotates.

Yet another aspect of the invention is a method including rotating an impeller having at least one flexible vane the at least one flexible vane at least partially comprising a piezoelectric film. The method may further comprise striking at least one rigid impact arm with the flexible vane as the impeller rotates.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The invention includes an apparatus and method for generating electricity from fluid flow. The fluid may be a gas or liquid. One application for the invention is an energy supply for a weapon. When the weapon is airborne the fluid flow that powers the apparatus is the air flow around the weapon. The electricity that is generated may be used as it is generated or stored for later use. In a weapon the electricity is generally used to initiate an explosive fire train.

The term piezoelectric film for the purposes of this patent includes all forms of piezoelectric material whether in the form of a film or in some other form. Although films are particularly useful for the invention other forms of piezoelectric material may be used.

In one embodiment the entire beam is made of a piezoelectric film. In other embodiments for example the portion of the beam that contacts the impact arm may include a material that is more durable than a piezoelectric film so that the life of the apparatus is extended. It is not necessary that the impact arm actually contact the piezoelectric film but only that the piezoelectric film is strained when the impact arm strikes the beam . Although shows a single impact arm and a single beam multiple arms and beams may be used.

Referring again to as impeller rotates impact arm strikes beam . The beam is cantilevered and flexes when struck by the impact arm thereby generating electricity. An electrical storage circuit including for example a capacitor is connected to the beam . The electricity may be used immediately or more generally stored in the storage circuit . Storage circuit may be connected to a fuze circuit not shown of a weapon. In one embodiment the apparatus is part of a fuze of a weapon. When the weapon is airborne the impeller may be deployed such that the ambient air causes the impeller to rotate.

At least one rigid impact arm is disposed such that the flexible vanes strike the rigid impact arm as the impeller rotates. It is not necessary that the impact arm actually contact the piezoelectric film portion of flexible vane although it may. It is required that the piezoelectric film portion of the flexible vane is strained when the impact arm strikes the flexible vane . Multiple impact arms may be used. Flexible vanes are connected to a storage circuit not shown that may be mounted on the impeller or separate from the impeller. If the circuit is separate from the impeller then rotating contacts not shown may be used to transfer the electricity from the impeller to the storage circuit.

Another embodiment of the invention includes the impeller with at least one flexible vane comprising wholly or partially a piezoelectric film. In an exemplary embodiment there are a plurality of flexible vanes including wholly or partially a piezoelectric film. In this embodiment there is no impact arm. Rather the turbulence of the air flow causes the flexible vanes to deform thereby generating electricity.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
