This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 882 270 filed Dec. 28 2006 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention relates to inhibitors of poly ADP ribose polymerase ways to make them and methods of treating patients using them.

Poly ADP ribose polymerase PARP is essential for facilitating DNA repair controlling RNA transcription mediating cell death and regulating immune response. This activity makes PARP inhibitors targets for a number of disorders. PARP inhibitors have shown utility for treating diseases such as ischemia reperfusion injury inflammatory disease retroviral infections ischemia reperfusion injury myocardial infarction stroke and other neural trauma organ transplantation reperfusion of the eye kidney gut and skeletal muscle arthritis gout inflammatory bowel disease CNS inflammation such as MS and allergic encephalitis sepsis septic shock hemmorhagic shock pulmonary fibrosis and uveitis diabetes and Parkinsons disease liver toxicity following acetominophen overdose cardiac and kidney toxicities from doxorubicin and platinum based antineoplastic agents and skin damage secondary to sulfur mustards. PARP inhibitors have also been shown to potentiate radiation and chemotherapy by increasing cell death of cancer cells limiting tumor growth decreasing metastasis and prolonging the survival of tumor bearing animals. There is therefore a need in the therapeutic arts for PARP inhibitors.

One embodiment of this invention therefore pertains to compounds that inhibit the activity of poly ADP ribose polymerase and have formula I
