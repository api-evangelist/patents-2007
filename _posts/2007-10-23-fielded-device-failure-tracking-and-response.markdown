Aspects disclosed herein pertain to a communication system that selectively collects and analyzes fault data from a population of mobile communication devices and in particular discriminates fault collection and reporting to particular software and hardware components of a mobile computing platform.

Advances in technology have resulted in smaller and more powerful personal computing devices. For example there currently exist a variety of portable personal computing devices including wireless computing devices such as portable wireless telephones personal digital assistants PDAs and paging devices that are each small lightweight and can be easily carried by users. Consumers are increasingly offered many types of electronic devices that can be provisioned with an array of software applications. Distinct features such as email Internet browsing game playing address book calendar media players electronic book viewing voice communication directory services etc. increasingly are selectable applications that can be loaded on a multi function device such as a smart phone portable game console or hand held computer.

Even with these advances mobile communication devices tend to have communication bandwidth processing and user interface constraints over general purpose computing devices. For example the screen size amount of available memory and file system space amount of input and output capabilities and processing capability may each be limited by the small size of the device. Because of such severe resource constraints the computing platforms for such devices are often optimized for a particular telephone chipset and user interface hardware. As such generally applicable solutions are typically not suitable to a population of wireless mobile devices.

Despite these challenges today most of the mobile wireless devices have the capabilities to access various wireless broadband networks. In fact the rapid advances in technology mass market adoption standardization and globalization enabled various companies to collaborate in bringing innovate and compelling services to the market. This collaboration led to the formation of a wireless mobile service Eco System consisting of radio access network RAN technology providers mobile computing platform providers mobile device manufactures aka original equipment manufacturers OEMs and wireless broadband service providers WBSP . With the advent of wireless multicast systems e.g. Forward Link Only FLO and Digital Video Broadcast Handheld DVB H and their convergence with wireless broadband systems the Eco System is growing further with Wireless Multicast Service Providers WMSP that distribute for content providers.

While the Eco System is able to provide compelling services such as mobile television mobile Internet etc. the mobile computing platforms devices that are necessary for accessing these services require complex technology integration from various players in the Eco System. Due to the pace of innovation competition and other market forces there is an enormous pressure on Eco System partners to bring new products and services to market. This is leading to shorter cycle time to market and increased expectations on the reliability of the services applications and devices. Testing processes to ensure reliability and quality of various mobile wireless devices services and or applications before launching to market has become quite complex. Moreover simulating all kinds of field failure conditions in the lab environment does not provide adequate infrastructure to find the latent bugs that cause failures in the hardware and software systems besides consuming time and resources. However the Eco System partners are faced with critical decisions often without adequate testing or data which is critical to establish the reliability of the hardware and software.

After the mobile device or application or service is launched often latent bugs are manifested in field conditions resulting the following issues a increase call volume due to customer complaints b inability to troubleshoot and isolate the actual bugs due to inadequate information to duplicate the conditions that resulted in the failure c increased time to isolate bugs and assign ownership d lost revenue due to increased churn of subscribers e recalling large number of devices causing lost revenue for all the players in the Eco System and f poor customer satisfaction.

However the wireless mobile devices and the communication networks that service them are still constrained by the capabilities available to address the problem. Excessive emphasis on isolating bugs can come at the expense of the performance of these devices to perform their intended functions also causing reduction in quality of service and performance and thus customer satisfaction for devices that are not malfunctioning.

The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed versions. This summary is not an extensive overview and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate the scope of such versions. Its purpose is to present some concepts of the described versions in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

In one aspect a method is provided for reporting fault data to a provider of wireless data communication to a wireless mobile device that logs fault data sufficient for diagnosis of a responsible component among a plurality of components when a fault condition occurs. In particular logging fault data for each vertical software layer is sufficient for diagnosis of a responsible component among a plurality of components comprising at least one software component residing on a first software vertical layer and a second software component residing on a second software vertical layer in response to a fault condition. Thus when a fault reporting enabling event is received the wireless mobile device reports the logged fault data to a wireless data communication provider for diagnosis to the responsible component. Thereby the limited resources of a wireless data communication network are efficiently used yet helpful fault data from fielded wireless mobile devices is available to pinpoint a cause of otherwise difficult to duplicate failures as well as the overall prevalence and severity of the fault.

In other aspects a processor computer product and an apparatus each provide means for performing the method for reporting fault data.

In yet an additional aspect a computer implemented apparatus for reporting fault data to a provider of wireless data communication has a computing platform executing a plurality of components. A fault diagnostic logging component logs fault data sufficient for diagnosis of a responsible component among the plurality of components in response to a fault condition. In particular logging fault data for each vertical software layer is sufficient for diagnosis of a responsible component among a plurality of components comprising at least one software component residing on a first software vertical layer and a second software component residing on a second software vertical layer in response to a fault condition. A data receiver can receive a fault reporting enabling event whereupon a transmitter wirelessly reports the logged fault data to a wireless data communication provider for diagnosis to the responsible component.

In another aspect a method for collecting and analyzing fault data from a plurality of wireless communication devices begins with sending a fault reporting enabling event to a wireless communication device for logging fault data for each vertical software layer sufficient for diagnosis of a responsible component among a plurality of components comprising at least one software component residing on a first software vertical layer and a second software component residing on a second software vertical layer in response to a fault condition. Then wirelessly receiving the logged fault data reported by the wireless communication device allows for diagnosing the responsible component for the fault condition.

In other aspects a processor computer product and apparatus provide means for performing the method for collecting and analyzing data.

In yet a further aspect a computer implemented apparatus for collecting and analyzing fault data from a plurality of wireless communication devices has a fault collection enabling component that wirelessly sends a fault reporting enabling event to a wireless communication device for logging and reporting fault data. A data communication receiver wirelessly receives the logged fault data reported by the wireless communication device. In particular logging fault data for each vertical software layer is sufficient for diagnosis of a responsible component among a plurality of components comprising at least one software component residing on a first software vertical layer and a second software component residing on a second software vertical layer in response to a fault condition. In addition a fault diagnostic component determines the responsible component for the fault condition among a plurality of components in response.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends one or more versions comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects and are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the versions may be employed. Other advantages and novel features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings and the disclosed versions are intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.

A fault remediation system for fielded wireless mobile devices addresses field failure data collection consolidation of field failure data and an information services platform so that the players in a wireless mobile broadcast broadband application service value chain to respond to field failure problems in a consistent and automated manner from wireless mobile devices over wireless multicast and or wireless broadband networks. An elegant and extremely flexible mechanism enables the failure data collection from a targeted set of wireless mobile devices. In addition sophisticated mechanisms identify targeted set of devices that should participate in field failure data collection based on user specified operational requirements e.g. selected OEM device configuration type subscribers to a specific wireless broadband serve failure occurrence certain time limits etc. . The fault data logging on the mobile device is vertically integrated to allow diagnosis and assignment to a responsible party for fixing testing and release with subsequent certification and deployment.

In addition the system provides the capability for dynamic adaptation of field failure alert mechanisms based on the number failure intensity severity and many other parameters. Also the system provides mechanism to consolidate all the failure events from various devices and provides insight into the reliability of the software hardware based on the severity of the failures and time to fail parameters which helps the value chain partners in guiding their tests in the lab to deliver reliable hardware and software for the mobile wireless devices which enhances the customer experience.

Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident however that the various aspects may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to concisely describing these versions.

The apparatus and methods are especially well suited for use in wireless environments but may be suited in any type of network environment including but not limited to communication networks public networks such as the Internet private networks such as virtual private networks VPN local area networks wide area networks long haul networks or any other type of data communication network.

Referring to a communication system enables a carrier to provide two way wireless communication services across a network to a population of wireless communication devices which in turn communicates via a wireless two way data communication transceiver . Each communication device executes a number of applications supported by an operating system leveraging the data communication as well as performing other standalone features. Some of these applications are further supported by an application service execution environment .

The two way data communication provides considerable benefit to the communication devices . However receipt of media content e.g. images video audio downloaded applications etc. can easily burden the available throughput of a wireless communication channel depicted at . This is especially true when a large number of users choose to access large files simultaneously from a content provider via the carrier . Multicasting provides an economical way to extend media content services. In particular a multicast service operator simultaneously sends content depicted at to a multiple number of communication devices each receiving the content with a wireless multicast reception component .

Typically the population of communication devices is challenged by a number of factors. First a number of entities are responsible for the hardware and software integrated into each communication device . For example a device manufacturer develops or is otherwise responsible for the hardware e.g. portions of the wireless two way data communication and some software e.g. operating system . Application vendors can be responsible for certain applications . The carrier can also be responsible for some applications as well as the robustness and quality of service QoS for the communication channel . In addition the multicast service operator can be responsible for the portions of the communication device such as the wireless multicast reception component the application service execution environment . A system fault can be caused solely by one of these components of the communication device without an indication of which component it is or incompatibilities between components can create a failure.

Second another challenge for such an integrated device is that various communication devices can have a different hardware and or software configuration from the others. Some of the software can manifest faults or failures on certain devices only. Third the universe of possible configurations and thus possible permutations of configurations goes up given the ease in which communication devices can be individually configured to suit the needs of the user such as by installing activating certain applications or features. Fourth since many of the communication devices are advantageously portable the respective communication link made to the carrier can suffer by localized problems that are a problem in and of themselves or expose a weakness or fault in the software.

Without other fault diagnostic tools a user of a communication device that encounters a failure contacts customer relationship management CRM of the carrier . Often the carrier provides the device from the device manufacturer as well as offering the additional services of multicasting by multicast service operator . As such the carrier tends to be the recipient of user complaints. However given that the CRM may not have any insights into the cause of the failure the carrier may be limited in what solutions to the problem can be offered.

Advantageously the communication system includes a selective fault remediation system distributed among certain entities depicted in the illustrative version as including fault detection collection and reporting software on the communication device networked to a fault enablement collection component a fault diagnostics component and a fault solution database .

In one aspect a fault diagnostic logging component of the fault detection collection and reporting software on the communication device is responsible for logging detailed fault reports. The logging component is vertically integrated such that information is sufficient to diagnose the cause of the fault. The logging component may be distributed and portions may reside in different portions of the communication device depending up on the software and hardware architecture or a specific implementation mechanism. The logging component has means to quickly and persistently store the detailed fault information especially since the fault could cause shutdown or restart the communication device .

In an illustrative set of fault data fields are depicted in a data record that contain information detected and stored by the fault logging component of . It should be appreciated that this listing is neither all inclusive nor encompassing necessarily required data fields but rather depends upon what minimal set of critical data elements is determined to be required for troubleshooting of field failures. The data structure is depicted as including component specific failure details field which could be a particular interrupt that occurred indicative of a fault or failure condition e.g. watchdog timer timed out application not responding etc. . A data field contains operating system specific run time information. A data field contains central processing unit CPU stack and memory registers. A data field contains tasks running at the time of the failure. A data field contains a duration time value for how long the device or process had been executing before the fault failure occurred. A data field contains a date time for when the fault failure occurred. The data record can contain identifying information such as a data field containing identification for the communication device . A data field can contain location information that can help determine faults with correlations to a location e.g. shadowed reception area interference etc. . The device can have access to global positioning system GPS coordinates radio frequency identifier RFID data provided within a facility etc. Further a data field can provide a device fault report number that uniquely identifies this particular fault occurrence to avoid duplicate reporting. Other data fields can be provided to assist in narrowing down the demographics and scenario that led to the fault in order to assist in diagnostics such as a user input description field. For example location data e.g. GPS coordinates can be included as a data field .

Returning to the fault diagnostic logging component can perform logging with reference to a device settings such as not logging fault data until user and or network enabled automatically overwriting oldest fault data records selecting a level of detail of fault reports either stored and or reported or automatically logging fault data in the event that reporting is enabled later.

In particular in one aspect a fault diagnostic enabler component of the fault detection collection and reporting software may reside on the application layer or it could be a distributed component which enables logging of fault diagnostic information by the fault diagnostic logging component and or enables disables reporting of the logged fault diagnostic information. The fault diagnostic enabler component is responsive to the fault enablement collection component of the selective fault remediation system . These commands can be unicast solely to particular communication device or multicast simultaneously to the population of communication devices . In one aspect the fault diagnostic enabler component can receive a signal enabling collection and reporting of fault data with additional parameters specifying the manner of logging and or reporting and can receive a signal disabling collection and reporting of fault data. To the extent that the fault diagnostic enabler component is responsive to enabling or disabling logging of fault data this command will be relayed to the fault diagnostic logging component . Enablement or disablement of reporting of fault data is relayed to a fault log collection reporting component to start or stop respectively sending detailed fault logs to the fault enablement collection component of the fault remediation system or other directed recipients.

In an illustrative data record or enabling collection and reporting of fault data by the communication device of includes parameters to specify a subset of communication devices and or a subset of fault types that are to be reported thus optimizing utilization of capacity of the communication devices and the overall communication system . Examples of parameters include a data field identifying communication device model s that should report fault data. A data field specifies communication devices made by one or more OEMs that should report fault data. A data field specifies one or more wireless broadband service providers WBSP for which the devices in question may be a subscriber. A data field specifies a billing and customer care provider BNC that may be applicable. A data field specifies a wireless multicast service provider WMSP . A data field specifies version s of a mobile application executed by wireless mobile devices. A data field specifies a severity of faults that should be reported such as for excluding low severity faults or for zeroing in on a particular class of faults associated with an undiagnosed fault thought to have a common cause. A data field specifies a fault collection window which limits fault to those that occur within the time window to be reported. A data field specifies a fault log upload window which can be chosen to utilize a lower demand state of the communication system . Other data fields can specify other criteria such as whether the criteria provided are to be logically considered in union or intersection.

Returning to the fault log collection reporting component is responsible for retrieving the fault logs and reports the data by uploading to the fault enablement collection component or other specified recipient over the two way wireless communication channel . The reporting component may be launched by any mobile applications that runs on the communication device if permitted such as for other entities e.g. device manufacturer application vendors etc. to initiate fault diagnostics. As another example mobile applications that consume data that is delivered over wireless multicast networks may invoke this reporting component when encountering any failures. As yet another example an end user can invoke the collection reporting component through a user interface not shown to assist in diagnosing a failure. Moreover this user initiated reporting can entail wirelessly uploading fault data to a system accessible by the user or for viewing on the user interface so that the reporting can occur verbally to a customer service representative which can be a person working for a Billing and Customer Care Provider BNC or a Customer Relations Manager CRM .

In an illustrative aspect the fault remediation system and in particular the fault enablement collection component has direct access to demographic subscriber data listed in for the population of communication devices that can be used to determine a subset of communication devices to be fault enabled and or to correlate with reported fault data. Thereby the amount of transmitted data over a limited throughput communication channel is reduced. Alternatively the fault enablement collection component is relieved of concerns for privacy in maintaining and or accessing such a database of information directly related to users of communication devices e.g. wireless mobile devices if each fault report volunteers such information. As another example another party such as a carrier can maintain some or all of this demographic subscriber data utilizing it for customer relationship management purposes but filtering user identification information for purposes of diagnostics by another entity. For communication devices that do not have location sensing capability the fault remediation system can access network information indicating the access node through which contact has been made as an approximate location. As another example for devices reporting GPS coordinates the fault remediation system can advantageously provided assisted global positioning system A GPS wherein direction finding from the radio access network RAN supplements the GPS data.

In an illustrative version the application service execution environment is BREW enabled. The Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW software developed by Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego Calif. exists over the operating system of a computing device such as a wireless cellular phone. BREW software can provide a set of interfaces to particular hardware features found on computing devices. The execution environment may further comprise uiOne delivery system UDS . The uiOne architecture also developed by Qualcomm Inc. as part of BREW provides a set of BREW extensions that enable rapid development of rich and customizable User Interfaces UIs i.e. active content over the air OTA up gradable helps to evolve download business beyond applications provides theming of part or entire handset UI and utilizes BREW UI Widgets. Thus BREW uiOne reduces the time to market for handsets carrier customization and consumer personalization. To do this the BREW uiOne provides a clear set of abstractions adding two new layers to the application development stack for BREW. The uiOne delivery system is used to update communication device UIs over the air. This delivery system can be deployed in a standalone fashion allowing operators to leverage the functionality of their own delivery system. Additional benefits can be realized by deploying uiOne architecture with uiOne delivery system especially when deployed in conjunction with other elements of the BREW solution e.g. monetization and billing of downloadable UI packages when the operator does not already have the appropriate infrastructure .

In addition the multicast service operator utilizes Forward Link Only FLO multicasting also developed by Qualcomm Inc. which builds upon the BREW execution environment . However it should be appreciated with the benefit of the present disclosure that other multicasting approach such as Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld DVB H can also benefit with aspects described herein.

The fault remediation system advantageously optimizes the following considerations and attributes listed in Table 1 

In an exemplary version of a communication system is depicted according to some aspects as any type of computerized device. For example the communication device may comprise a mobile wireless and or cellular telephone. Alternatively the communication device may comprises a fixed communication device such as a Proxy Call Session Control Function P CSCF server a network device a server a computer workstation etc. It should be understood that communication device is not limited to such a described or illustrated devices but may further include a Personal Digital Assistant PDA a two way text pager a portable computer having a wired or wireless communication portal and any type of computer platform having a wired and or wireless communications portal. Further the communication device can be a remote slave or other similar device such as remote sensors remote servers diagnostic tools data relays and the like which does not have an end user thereof but which simply communicates data across a wireless or wired network. In alternate aspects the communication device may be a wired communication device such as a landline telephone personal computer set top box or the like. Additionally it should be noted that any combination of any number of communication devices of a single type or a plurality of the afore mentioned types may be utilized in a cellular communication system not shown . Therefore the present apparatus and methods can accordingly be performed on any form of wired or wireless device or computer module including a wired or wireless communication portal including without limitation wireless modems Personal Computer Memory Card International Association PCMCIA cards access terminals personal computers telephones or any combination or sub combination thereof.

Additionally the communication device may include a user interface for purposes such as viewing and interacting with advertisements. This user interface includes an input device operable to generate or receive a user input into the communication device and an output device operable to generate and or present information for consumption by the user of the communication device . For example input device may include at least one device such as a keypad and or keyboard a mouse a touch screen display a microphone in association with a voice recognition module etc. Further for example output device may include a display an audio speaker a haptic feedback mechanism etc. Output device may generate a graphical user interface a sound a feeling such as a vibration or a Braille text producing surface etc.

Further communication device may include a computer platform operable to execute applications to provide functionality to the device and which may further interact with input device and output device . Computer platform may include a memory which may comprise volatile and nonvolatile memory portions such as read only and or random access memory RAM and ROM erasable programmable read only memory EPROM electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM flash memory and or any memory common to computer platforms. Further memory may include active memory and storage memory including an electronic file system and any secondary and or tertiary storage device such as magnetic media optical media tape soft and or hard disk and removable memory components. In the illustrative version memory is depicted as RAM memory and a nonvolatile local storage component both connected to a data bus of the computer platform .

Further computer platform may also include a processor which may be an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other chipset processor logic circuit or other data processing device. In some aspects such as when communication device comprises a cellular telephone processor or other logic such as an application specific integration circuit ASIC may execute an application programming interface API that interfaces with any resident software components depicted as applications e.g. games that may be active in memory for other functions e.g. communication call control alarm clock text messaging etc. . It should be appreciated with the benefit of the present disclosure that applications consistent with aspects of the present invention may omit other applications and or omit the ability to receive streaming content such as voice call data call and media related applications in memory . Device APIs may be a runtime environment executing on the respective communication device. One such API runtime environment is BREW API .

Additionally processor may include various processing subsystems embodied in hardware firmware software and combinations thereof that enable the functionality of communication device and the operability of the communication device on communications system . For example processing subsystems allow for initiating and maintaining communications and exchanging data with other networked devices as well as within and or among components of communication device . In one aspect such as in a cellular telephone processor may include one or a combination of processing subsystems such as sound non volatile memory file system transmit receive searcher layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 main control remote procedure handset power management diagnostic digital signal processor vocoder messaging call manager Bluetooth system Bluetooth LPOS position determination position engine user interface sleep data services security authentication USIM SIM universal subscriber identity module subscriber identity module voice services graphics USB universal serial bus multimedia such as MPEG Moving Picture Experts Group protocol multimedia GPRS General Packet Radio Service short message service SMS short voice service SVS web browser etc. For the disclosed aspects processing subsystems of processor may include any subsystem components that interact with applications executing on computer platform .

Computer platform may further include a GPS engine or other location sensing components provide location information of the communication device .

A communications module that enables communications among the various components of communication device as well as being operable to communications related to receiving enablement disablement fault logging reporting commands and reporting fault logs. Communications module may be embodied in hardware firmware software and or combinations thereof and may further include all protocols for use in intra device and inter device communications. In one aspect the communication module includes a wireless broadband access technology portion and a wireless multicast technology portion . The two way wireless broadband access technology portion can include one or more of a wireless code division multiple access W CDMA component an Evolution Data Optimized EV DO component an IEEE 802.11 i.e. often mischaracterized by the trademark WiFi component and a Bluetooth component . The wireless multicast technology portion can include for example a Forward Link Only FLO component and or a Digital Video Broadcast Handheld DVB H component .

Certain of these capabilities of the communication device can be facilitated by code loaded from local storage retained in memory and executed by the processor such as an operating system OS . A user interface UI module facilitates interactive control with the user interface . The UI module includes a user initiated fault reporting module that provides tailored interaction options for enabling fault logging or to view or report fault logs by interacting with a fault collection and reporting module . Applications can be the cause of faults failures as well as other components of the computer platform . A location reporting component can include logic that selectively reports device location.

The BREW APIs provide the ability for applications to call Device APIs and other functions without having to be written specifically for the type of communication device . Thus applications if composed in BREW or other software components on the communication device may operate identically or with slight modifications on a number of different types of hardware configurations within the operating environment provided by BREW API which abstracts certain hardware aspects. A BREW extension adds additional capability to the programming platform of the BREW API such as offering MP3 players Java Virtual Machines etc. As an example the UI module can be a brew extension .

In the illustrative version the multicast capability of the wireless multicast technologies portion are leveraged to provide media content for presentation on the user interface and are depicted by a content selection engine a selected content cache and a content player .

The fault collection and reporting component further comprises an enabler component a logging component a collect report component and a stored fault data structure .

In order to distribute computational overhead and or to reduce transmission overhead on the communication system an artificial intelligence AI component and or a rule based logic component can infer user behavior for reporting make decisions as to when a reportable fault related event has occurred and or extrapolate location based on intermittent location sensing etc or to diagnose the cause of a failure.

The rules based logic component can be employed to automate certain functions described or suggested herein. In accordance with this alternate aspect an implementation scheme e.g. rule can be applied to define types of attributes that should be acted upon or ignored create rules that are aware of location sensing status performance delays in certain components of the computing platform that would be deemed by the user to be a failure or poor performance etc. By way of example it will be appreciated that the rule based implementation can automatically define criteria for severity of a fault.

The AI component can facilitate automating performance of one or more features described herein such as learning what is normal and abnormal performance of a wireless mobile device perhaps before and after a change in software installed or executed extrapolating intermittent location data adjusting user feedback provided to a user based on machine learning. Thus employing various AI based schemes can assist in carrying out various aspects thereof.

A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector x x1 x2 x3 x4 xn to a class label class x . A classifier can also output a confidence that the input belongs to a class that is f x confidence class x . Such classification can employ a probabilistic and or statistical based analysis e.g. factoring into the analysis utilities and costs to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed.

A support vector machine SVM is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs that splits in an optimal way the triggering input events from the non triggering events. Other classification approaches including Na ve Bayes Bayesian networks decision trees neural networks fuzzy logic models maximum entropy models etc. can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.

As will be readily appreciated from the subject specification the subject invention can employ classifiers that are pre trained e.g. via a generic training data from multiple users as well as methods of reinforcement learning e.g. via observing user behavior observing trends receiving extrinsic information . Thus the subject invention can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions including but not limited to determining according to a predetermined criteria.

In a methodology for wireless broadcasting fault detection collection analysis and correction includes in block a population of wireless mobile devices that consume carrier and or multicast services. A determination is made that an investigation is to be made into failures in block . This could be a default setting of the device to do fault logging and reporting. This could be a user initiated investigation. This could be a carrier initiated investigation e.g. SMS enablement and or a multicast provider initiated.

In block the fault collection and reporting is enabled with one implementation discussed below with regard to . Detailed fault reports are collected in block in accordance with parameters or criteria specified in the fault enablement reporting event of block . For example software components applicable devices fault severity and or time window for fault collection can be specified. In block the reported fault data is analyzed for failure trends and causes. The amount of enabled fault reporting can be adjusted as the problem is better understood. Once a cause of a failure is attributed to a particular component or interaction between components a responsible hardware software developer for that component is assigned responsibility for the failure in block . The preliminary results are stored in a solution database in block to assist other entities in the value chain that may be getting queries from users or developers. In block the responsible developer performs a fix tests the fix and releases the fix. A system level certification is performed on the fix to avoid integration issues that could be introduced by the fix. Depending on the applicability of the fix a recall upgrade process in block is initiated to introduce the fix to fielded and to new devices. Then the final solution updates the solution database in block .

In an illustrative fault enablement methodology is depicted as a timing diagram including a population of wireless mobile devices A E a wireless broadband service provider WBSP represented by a WBSP fault data collection server and a WBSP operator and a wireless multicast service provider WMSP represented by WMSP fault data enablement server and WBSP operator . One or more fault analysis response servers diagnose the fault data collected and could be located at either or both of the WBSP WMSP as well as an OEM application vendors etc.

At the WBSP operator configures the WBSP fault data collection server with thresholds that when triggered cause an alert of a needed fault enablement action. In the aspect as illustrated some or all of the wireless mobile devices can send a summary failure data message such as by SMS either automatically or user initiated. Although only a fraction of the devices with faults may send such a summary these reports can create an alert regarding a problem in the fielded devices. This is depicted as wireless mobile device A sending an SMS fault summary at to the WBSP fault data collection server which in turn determines that this report has not cumulatively exceeded a threshold at . Then wireless mobile device B sends an SMS fault summary at to the collection server which again determines that this report has not cumulatively exceeded a threshold at . However when wireless mobile device C sends an SMS fault summary at the collection server determines that the threshold has been exceeded at and sends a field failure alert summary at to the WBSP operator . Based upon an assessment of generally what type of field failure data may be needed to diagnose the failure the WBSP operator sends an enable fault data collection instruction at to the WBSB fault data collection server .

It should be appreciated with the benefit of the present disclosure that the SMS message may be saved for later sending until the next time that the SMS is invoked if currently not in reception range. As another alternatively the SMS message may be relayed through a backend process such as through a customer service representative assisting to troubleshoot a device especially not capable of wirelessly relaying the fault data.

In the illustrative version the ability to wirelessly multicast the fault enablement reporting event to some or all of the wireless mobile devices has advantages in reaching these devices as well as not detrimentally impacting the wireless communication channel as compared to individual messages. To that end the WBSP fault data collection server sends an enable fault data collection request at to the WMSP fault data enablement server which in turn relays an enable fault data collection alert at to the WMSP operator . If the request is in order the WMSP operator sends a notify enable fault data collection command at to the WMSP fault data enablement server .

Thereby multicasting of a fault reporting enabling event depicted at is sent to the population of mobile wireless devices which may continue for a period of time to saturate the population. It should be appreciated that sequencing of communication to individual mobile devices is not necessary and that in some applications sufficient coverage may occur with a single broadcast. In some applications a higher penetration can be desirable and achieved through repeated broadcasts.

In the event that multicasting is not available to some of the mobile devices the WBSP fault data collection server can send SMS broadcast enable fault data collection messages depicted at although reception difficulties could cause certain devices not to receive this SMS enablement.

Thus enabled for fault reporting when mobile device C encounters a fault a detailed fault information report depicted at is sent to the WBSP fault data collection server . Similarly when mobile device D encounters a fault a detailed fault information report depicted at is sent to the WBSP fault data collection server . When mobile device E encounters a fault a detailed fault information report depicted at is sent to the WBSP fault data collection server which in turn uploads the fault logs as depicted at to the fault analysis response server for diagnosis.

It should be appreciated that aspects described herein segregate certain functions for network level storage and processing and other functions for performance by a mobile communication device. It should be appreciated with the benefit of the present disclosure that applications consistent with aspects can include configurations with more distributed processing to reduce computational overhead at a centralized location and or reduce communication loads. Alternatively some limited capability mobile devices can be served with mobile advertising with additional processing centralized.
