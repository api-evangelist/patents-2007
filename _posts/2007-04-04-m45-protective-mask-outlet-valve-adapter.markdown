title: M45 protective mask outlet valve adapter
abstract: An adapter to connect a portable testing device known as the Joint Service Mask Leakage Tester (JSMLT) to the outlet valve body of a protective mask such as the M45 mask for testing and validating the operation of the outlet valve of the mask prior to use.

The invention described herein may be manufactured licensed and used by or for the United States Government.

Protective masks also known as gas masks chemical biological masks or more recently as joint service masks prevent the wearer from exposure of portions of the face especially the mucus linings of the mouth and respiratory system and the eyes from contact with irritating and potentially debilitating or fatal environments. Such masks include outlet valves to permit the wearer to exhale while wearing the mask but also provide a possible site for leaks. Up until now there was no reliable way to test the outlet valves OV on the M45 mask prior to actual use. This invention provides an OV leakage test adapter for the M45 mask.

Generally protective masks or gas masks are known to employ outlet valves to allow the wearer to exhale while maintaining a seal against exposure of the wearer to poisonous or noxious gases since about World War I.

However increased hazards in the environment which not only include noxious or poisonous gases but have come to include other chemical biological radiological or nuclear agents have required much more sophisticated masks. Accordingly the art has developed what has come to be known as the state of the art Joint Service Mask M45 . In a preferred embodiment the present invention is directed to a leakage tester useful specifically for the M45 mask OV.

The Joint Service Mask Leakage Tester JSMLT is a portable testing device capable of testing serviceability and proper fit of current and future chemical biological radiological and nuclear CBRN protective masks.

In order to test the OV of the M45 the present inventors developed an outlet valve adapter OVA to be used with the JSMLT.

The outlet valve adapter OVA will be explained in detail as an embodiment of the invention for an M45 mask which comprises both inner and outer components as shown in and respectively. When attached to an M45 mask the OVA fits with an Outlet Valve Body OVB which OVB has a microphone communication port a drink tube an outlet valve cover tab but no means of attaching a JSMLT to the M45 mask. However it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to this embodiment and may be used to form adaptors for other styles types and countries of manufacture for protective masks in general.

The present invention provides the JSMLT with an apparatus preferably portable that can be easily applied to the JSMLT and act as an interface adapter for testing the M45 mask. This will fulfill the need in the field to test and validate M45 Outlet Valves as well as other types of masks.

In order to test the serviceability of the protective masks especially the outlet valve OV of a JSM M45 mask there arose a need to create an adapter to attach the JSMLT to the mask . However neither the OV of the M45 mask or its surrounding outer body provides a means for attaching the JSMLT to the mask.

The inventors have therefore developed a two part outlet valve adapter OVA comprising both inner component and outer component . The inner component has a rubbery elastomeric sealing surface that in use lines up with an edge of the M45 outlet valve body OVB . The inner component preferably comprises an injection molded part having an inner core of a polymer preferably an olefin polymer such as polyethylene and an outer covering of a polymer such as a thermoplastic elastomer preferably that sold under the trademark SANTOPRENE available from Santoprene Inc. a limited partnership of Exxon Mobil. SANTOPRENE having a durometer of 30 is particularly preferred.

To make the inner component the olefin polymer such as polyethylene is first molded and then used as a core for making the covering of SANTOPRENE . The mold for shaping the SANTOPRENE is larger than the core permitting the SANTOPRENE to encapsulate the core when the SANTOPRENE fills the over mold cavity. Over molded material having a durometer from 25 to 40 are suitable materials satisfying such durometer values and include aluminum stainless steel or polymers such as polyethylene or polycarbonate.

The inner component of the OVA provides vital support for the adapter as well as providing the interference fit designed to fit the range of OVB diameters. The inner component also includes the conduit which is used to connect the quick disconnect fitting of pressure tube .

The outer component can also be injection molded from a polymer such as an olefin preferably polypropylene. This component has sections cut away or formed as apertures and preferably with slotted cammed surfaces that will engage projections such as the drink tube and outlet valve cover tab of outlet valve body on the joint service M45 mask . When outer component is rotated relative to outlet valve body thereby engaging the cammed surfaces against protrusions on the mask these apertures and lock the outer component to outlet valve body while simultaneously exerting on inner component to create an interference fit or seal. These apertures also act as a locking mechanism to retain outer component in engagement with outlet valve body and maintain the pressure on inner component to maintain the seal by a downward force on inner component . The hole through the center of outer component provides a location for the pressure port to sit without any interference. Pressure port will attach to quick disconnect fitting of pressure tube leading to the Joint Service Mask Leakage Tester JSMLT .

The invention thus provides the adapter needed to connect existing JSMLT to the OV body of an M45 mask to test the function and serviceability of the outlet valve of the M45 mask .

It will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that the disclosed embodiments are given by way of example only and not by way of limitation. Thus one could readily substitute other materials for production of the components of the adapter. For example although we exemplified molded polymer materials various metals such as aluminum stainless steel or other polymers such as polyamide polycarbonate or other elastomers or engineering polymers can be used in production of the OVA without departing from the scope of the invention.

Further although we exemplified injection molding other forms of shaping such as casting extrusion transfer molding and other molding processes or machining can be used to form the components of the OVA.

Additionally although it is most desirable to design and shape the pans such that only the inner component and outer component are necessary to form the interference fit and seal required of the invention it is also possible to use shims or spacers between these components to create the dimensions necessary to form the correct downward pressure to create the interference fit and seal.

Having fully described our invention it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
