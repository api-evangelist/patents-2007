title: Deep-UV led and laser fluorescence apparatus for monitoring water quality
abstract: A method for detecting trace levels of dissolved organic compounds and leached plastic compounds in drinking water includes the steps of employing deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode induced fluorescence at sensitivity levels of several parts per trillion in real time so that a more compact and inexpensive excitation source, relative to a deep UV laser-induced fluorescence, for fluorescence detection of dissolved organic compounds in water is provided. The deep UV light-emitting diode is operated at an excitation near 265 nm and the laser induced fluorescence is detected at an emission near 450 nm to 500 nm for the dissolved organic compounds and near 310 nm for leached plastic compounds. Optical absorption filters and optical bandpass filters are employed to reduce out-of-band light emitting diode emissions and to eliminate second order optical interference signals for the detection of a fluorescence signal near 450 nm to near 500 nm. The system can measure water contained within a quartz optical cell, within bottled water containers, or in a flowing stream of water.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60 863 249 entitled Deep UV Led and Laser Fluorescence Apparatus for Monitoring Water Quality filed Oct. 27 2006 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

This invention was made with U.S. government support under grant No. W911NF 05 1 0431 awarded by the U.S. Army Research Office and grant No. N00014 04 1 0555 awarded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates to the monitoring of water quality and the detection of trace dissolved organic compounds leached plasticizers and or carbon DOCs in water and drinking water.

Most approaches for monitoring water quality in water processing plants are based on wet chemistry techniques that require the addition of other chemicals to water samples. Many use gas chromatography or liquid chromatography followed by laser fluorescence detection in a reagent capillary tube while others use reagents that change pH color or other physical characteristics depending upon the concentration of selected or trace species. Although useful in the lab these techniques work less well in the field where reagents are difficult to replace and harsh conditions may degrade them.

Earlier laser induced fluorescence LIF studies of water have used either blue green 513.5 nm argon ion lasers or doubled 535 nm Nd YAG lasers for excitation as well as staining reagents for improving the contrast of detected organisms. Studies that have relied on natural or auto fluorescence from water have generally not been as successful as those that have used fluorescent dyes. This is perhaps because blue green wavelengths do not sufficiently separate between the emission spectral peaks due to trace organics versus excitation or interfering background spectra.

As a result few previous LIF studies have drawn on the natural fluorescence of trace species in the water. The novel system therefore employs a deep UV laser source near 220 nm 300 nm for excitation to overcome some of the limitations of the natural fluorescence approach. The resultant fluorescence emission from the organics is well separated from the excitation wavelength.

There is a need for a reagentless deep UV 220 nm 300 nm laser induced fluorescence LIF system for detecting contaminates and potentially harmful substances in bottled and processed water and the ocean.

It is known that expensive laser based fluorescence detection of dissolved organic compounds in drinking water is feasible. Previous work by the inventors has shown that laser induced fluorescence can be used for the detection of trace DOCs and leached plasticizers such as Bisphenol A in water and that different drinking water samples from different bottled water manufacturers show significant different levels of DOCs and or plasticizers. Such prior art work appears in several research publications such as 1 Tunable ultraviolet laser induced fluorescence detection of trace plastics and dissolved organic compounds in water Vasanthi Sivaprakasam and Dennis K. Killinger Applied Optics 42 6739 2003 2 Development and initial calibration of a portable laser induced fluorescence system used for in situ measurements of trace plastics and organics in seawater and the Gulf of Mexico Vasanthi Sivaprakasam Robert Shannon Caiyan Luo Paula G. Coble Jennifer Boehme and Dennis K. Killinger Applied Optics 42 6747 2003 and 3 Water Monitoring with Laser Fluorescence Dennis Killinger and Vasanthi Sivaprakasam Invited Review OSA Optics and Photonics News p 35 January 2006

The 266 nm UV laser used for excitation in these published prior art studies by the authors and inventors cost 10 000. Accordingly there is a need for a low cost compact LED to replace the known expensive lasers.

Currently no real time or reagentless laser induced fluorescence systems have been authorized for use by water treatment plants. However for the past several years some water agencies have been testing a selected range of UV absorption and fluorescence water monitoring instruments. One such device is a UV visible 200 nm 750 nm absorption instrument from S CAN in Austria that can detect small changes in the optical absorption properties of water.

Another fluorescence based test is used to monitor water for the e coli bacteria. This involves growing a culture obtained from a water sample using a fluorescence dye or stain and counting the organisms by either visual microscopes or laser readers. Fluorescence is also used in liquid chromatography laser induced fluorescence or LC LIF a technique in which a capillary tube is used to separate the chemical species and a laser reads the separated column.

However in view of the art considered as a whole at the time the present invention was made it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in this art how the identified needs could be met.

The long standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for a compact less expensive UV LED based laser induced fluorescence instrument to detect and monitor dissolved organic compounds and or carbon in drinking water in real time is now met by a new useful and nonobvious invention that detects deep UV near 266 nm laser and deep UV LED excited fluorescence emission near 450 to 500 nm of the DOCs in the water.

The novel method for detecting trace levels of dissolved organic compounds in drinking water includes the steps of employing a deep ultraviolet UV light emitting diode laser induced fluorescence at sensitivity levels of several parts per trillion in real time. This provides a more compact and inexpensive excitation source relative to a deep UV laser induced fluorescence for laser induced fluorescence detection of dissolved organic compounds in water. The cost of the deep UV LED near 265 nm is about 100.00 and consumes much less power and is more compact than the deep UV 266 nm laser cost of 10 000 .

The deep UV light emitting diode is preferably operated at an excitation near 266 nm and the laser induced fluorescence is detected at an emission near 450 nm to 500 nm. Excitation in the UV up to wavelengths near 320 nm can be used for excitation but optical filtering is less selective and the sensitivity is less than that obtained using wavelengths near 265 nm or less.

Optical absorption filters and optical bandpass filters are employed to reduce out of band light emitting diode LED emissions and to eliminate second order optical interference signals for the detection of a fluorescence signal near 450 nm to near 500 nm.

A modulated continuous wave LED excitation source is employed to produce detection sensitivity within a factor of twenty 20 to thirty 30 times relative to a pulsed 8.6 KHz 266 nm laser source.

A pulsed about 10 KHz PRF LED source and a gated 100 ns detection system is used to provide gated noise rejection of the fluorescence signal to obtain increased sensitivity and reduced background noise because the fluorescence lifetime of the dissolved organic compounds in water is about 50 ns.

Modulated continuous wave LEDs using a lock in amplifier signal processing and pulsed LEDs using gated boxcar integrators are employed to optimize the dissolved organic compound fluorescence signals and improve the signal to noise ratio.

Grating spectrometers and silicon detectors arrays and or sets of optical filters in a sequential wheel arrangement with photomultiplier detectors are employed to detect the fluorescence emission.

The novel system has a sensitivity of about a few parts per trillion which is several orders of magnitude better than conventional spectrofluorometers. It has detected the presence of plastic resins and dissolved organic compounds in bottled drinking water monitored real time changes in DOCs in drinking water processed by reverse osmosis and has been used to track DOCs and river plumes in the Gulf of Mexico.

Conventional spectrofluorometers use Xenon lamps and excitation filtering spectrometers to produce the UV excitation beam but their beam intensity is three to nine orders of magnitude less intense than that available with a laser or LED source.

Pulsed atomic emission lamps in the deep UV such as a low pressure mercury lamp and optical narrow line filters may be used for the deep UV excitation source in the fluorescence system. Such lamps are less intense than LEDs and lasers by several orders of magnitude but provide sufficient excitation power if the DOC fluorescing concentrations is extremely large.

Conventional methods of water analysis can achieve a high degree of sensitivity necessary for water quality monitoring but they often require special sample preparation additional reagents or chemicals and often are not conducted in real time or on line.

Deep ultraviolet UV laser induced fluorescence LIF is effective for the detection of trace levels of dissolved organic compounds DOCS in water at the parts per billion ppb to parts per trillion ppt detection level. The instrument used to perform the steps of this invention is a laboratory developed pulsed laser induced fluorescence system. Said instrument is different from conventional commercially available fluorescence spectrofluorometers in that such spectrofluorometers typically include a continuous wave CW xenon emission lamp a grating spectrometer for excitation and a spectrometer for emission analysis. The novel system uses a chopped about 200 Hz CW excitation source so the signal processing involves detection of the chopped fluorescence signal. Such detection usually employs a lock in amplifier. However the use of a high PRF pulse repetition frequency pulsed laser source for excitation allows use of a gated boxcar integrator to detect the fluorescence emission and gains several orders of magnitude in signal to noise.

The data in is a disclosure of prior art involved in the laser induced fluorescence LIF detection of dissolved organic compounds in drinking water using a high power expensive UV laser source.

The LIF system light sources are two interchangeable high pulse repetition frequency 8.6 kHz UV lasers 266 nm and 355 nm illuminating a quartz cell with a flowing water sample. The optics include focusing lenses and filter wheels with cut off and optical interference filters selecting different wavelength ranges. The fluorescence signal detected by a photo multiplier tube PMT is sent to a gated integrator and boxcar averager. The system is integrated with a notebook computer and provides data in real time. diagrammatically depicts a portable LIF system.

The LIF system is used to record fluorescent spectra of different water samples such as distilled tap and river water . Substantial differences in spectra are observed between different brands of distilled bottled water. The river samples display large fluorescence peaks near 450 500 nm corresponding to the fluorescence of DOCs. The spectra of water processed by a reverse osmosis RO water purification unit has also been recorded. The unique fluorescence from plastic compounds Bisphenol A near 310 nm were detected and shown in

The signal to noise ratio S N of conventional spectrofluorometers may be improved by replacing the conventional CW or chopped xenon light sources with a high pulse repetition frequency PRF laser. The novel method employs high PRF gated boxcar signal processing instead of conventional analog lock in amplification. The spatial coherence of the excitation laser beam is also harnessed to allow for multi passing of the beam within the fluorescence cell.

By gating the boxcar processor only around the short 1 to 20 ns laser and emitted fluorescence pulse detector noise between laser pulses is rejected. This technique is viable when the fluorescence lifetime of the emitting species such as the DOCs and plastic resins is short 10 to 20 ns . Assuming equal average laser or optical excitation intensity the improvement I is on the order of the square root of the ratio of the laser pulse period T and the fluorescence lifetime or boxcar gate time T or 

For example in the case of a microchip laser operating at a PRF of 8.6 KHz Tof 0.1116 ms and a boxcar gate width of Tof 50 ns the improvement expected is close to 50.

The signal to noise ratio may also be improved by conducting high speed pulse averaging of more than 8 600 pulses in one second however such an improvement applies equally to the CW or high PRE pulsed laser case.

Several LIF systems which differed with regard to their laser tunability and spectroscopic detection techniques were considered. The decision of which to use was based on whether a laboratory tunable spectral survey was to be studied or a fixed wavelength field LIF instrument was to be deployed.

For tunable excitation and laboratory spectroscopic studies either 1 a large tripled Nd YAG pumped optical parametric oscillator doubled to produce 10 to 30 mJ pulse 20 Hz PRF tunable excitation from 220 nm to 350 nm or 2 a smaller nitrogen laser pumped doubled dye laser with 1 J pulse 20 Hz and tunable from 220 nm to 321 nm may be used.

The larger laser is used for initial spectroscopic work. However a larger laser will photobleach many trace species unless its power is attenuated. Accordingly a tunable doubled dye laser is relied upon for most of the tunable spectroscopic survey work disclosed herein.

A field deployable portable LIF unit diagrammatically depicted in includes a fixed wavelength 266 nm microchip laser 1 J pulse PRF 836 kHz and a 355 nm microchip laser that produces a factor of about one hundred 100 times the average power of the doubled dye laser. In all cases the output of the lasers is focused into a 1 cm wide quartz fluorescence cell through which water samples flow.

The emitted fluorescence is collected with a lens which is analyzed with a spectrometer and cooled CCD detector or PMT or spectrally sorted by up to twenty one 21 optical bandpass filters and detected by a PMT. The S N of these configurations as well as that of a more moderate sensitivity micro spectrometer using quinine sulfate as a fluorescence standard were compared.

With the compact spectrometer as a baseline the improvement was 80 for the spectrometer CCD system and 500 for the optical bandpass filter PMT system.

The tunable laser system is used to measure the excitation emission matrix EEM spectra of DOCs in water. The analysis shows that excitation around 245 to 260 nm is near the absorption peak of the DOCs.

The 266 nm laser source and spectrometer CCD detection system is used to obtain the fluorescence from various sources of natural water and a number of bottled drinking and distilled waters. In one analysis depicted in fluorescence was measured from the Hillsborough River Tampa Bay harbor water and clean distilled water Zephyrhills brand . In another tap water from the University of South Florida was measured along with three different brands of commercial bottled drinking water.

The emission spectrum from the natural water showed the attenuated Rayleigh scattered light at. 266 nm a sharp peak near 290 nm from the Raman water scatter line and a peak near 450 nm from the DOCs in the water. The signal from the DOCs in the river water was very high because said river has a considerable amount of dissolved organics tannins from oak tree leaves.

The analysis of the bottled drinking water showed that two brands had almost no DOC levels while another brand and the tap water had higher levels.

The prior art includes a plastic resin found to leach from underwater mines and plastic compounds into water. The resin is bisphenol A based on mass spectrometry studies. Human endocrine studies have also suggested that bisphenol A leached from plastic containers and cans may be penetrating the environment and affecting human growth and development.

Along this line of study we conducted extensive EEM spectral measurements by tuning the doubled dye laser from 220 nm to 340 nm When the laser was tuned from 220 nm to 280 nm the peak emission on an EEM spectra was near 330 and with a smaller peak near 400 nm at very short wavelengths and rebuilding at the longer wavelengths near 260 to 280 nm However the fluorescence merges with the water Raman line at the longer wavelengths this is why it is sometimes better to go to a very short wavelength that can be easily distinguished from that of a fluorescence line.

Extensive LIF studies with bisphenol A established a detection sensitivity of a few hundred parts per trillion. On the measured spectrum for different concentrations of bisphenol A the primary peak near 310 nm is from bisphenol A while the secondary peak near 410 nm has been attributed to salicylic acid one of the components that results from the photo induced breakdown of bisphenol A. In the experiments care was taken in choosing the rubber and plastic tubing for the water flow system. Plastic leached out from a number of soft rubber or plastic tubing silicone C Flex and led to a fluorescence signature similar to bisphenol A i.e. near 310 nm. To minimize this problem hard PTFE or PFA was used instead. See .

Similar plastic related compounds were observed leaching from everyday plastic containers utensils and food storage bags. For example we measured LIF spectra from distilled water placed in a microwavable plastic container heated in a microwave oven for three 3 minutes to 65 C and then placed on a table Although the water had cooled to room temperature within fifteen 15 minutes the leached plastic concentration increased as a function of time over the next twenty four 24 hours. See .

Further studies showed similar results for water placed in plastic zip lock bags at room temperature for a twenty four 24 hour period this was accelerated if the samples were initially heated.

Turning now to LIF measurements in ocean water the microchip lasers at 266 nm and 355 nm and the optical bandpass filter PMT configuration produced the best overall LIF sensitivity and were configured to fit into two portable travel cases. This system was used for research aboard a research cruise vessel along with other wet chemistry and marine science instruments in order to correlate real time LIF data of DOCs and other spectral signatures.

The LIF system was secured to the cabin of the research vessel. Sample lines were connected into the ship s water flow that continuously pulled water from beneath the ship into a de bubbler and out to the various work stations in the science cabin of the ship. Hydrocast water sampling hordes were deployed i.e. lowered down into the ocean to bring up water samples for the other wet chemistry instruments. The LIF system operated continuously 24 hours per day unattended.

A five day research cruise started in Key West cruised through several river and effluent currents within the Gulf of Mexico and ended in Tampa Bay. Plumes of DOCs were readily evident on the spectral analysis with some coinciding with a plume of red tide detected by other on board instruments. Fluorescence was observed near 680 nm that is due to the chlorophyll in phytoplankton. We plotted fluorescence over the five days at 450 nm peak of DOCs measured for the two excitation wavelengths at 266 nm and 355 nm and also that for the chlorophyll fluorescence near 680 nm The two sets of data were well correlated although there were deviations in some water masses. See .

Significantly the LIF system still had a S N level of about 100 in the clean blue water that we encountered about thirty 30 to one hundred 100 miles offshore. Due to the increased sensitivity of the LIF system compared to an onboard commercial spectrofluorometer this was the first time that the US Marine Science group had ever been able to measure fluorescence levels from the DOCs in clean water.

The data in is the first disclosure anywhere in the world of fluorescence detection of water using a deep UV LED source. is a diagrammatic depiction denoted as a whole of the experimental setup using a UV LED for excitation and the detection of LED induced fluorescence LEDIF emission from water samples contained within a quartz cell. Also depicted in is excitation using a 266 nm laser source in order to compare the two excitation sources. Said laser source is denoted and its power supply electrically connected thereto by conductor is denoted . Laser source delivers coherent light to quartz cell having a water sample therein. Spectrometer is connected to said quartz cell by optical fiber and said spectrometer is in electrical communication as at 24 with a personal computer . The UV LED is denoted and its driver and power supply is denoted and is in electrical communication therewith through conductor . The light from the UV LED is denoted . The quartz cell can also be any transparent container of water such as a clear water bottle that provides optical transmission of the excitation and fluorescence light in that the lens and fiber optics used to direct the light beam into the water can focus the excitation to a focal volume inside the container or cell. The angle between the excitation beam and the collected fluorescence beam can be 90 degrees as shown in but any angle is feasible including 0 degrees. A flowing stream of water can also be used in place of the quartz cell .

UV LEDs 265 nm and 320 nm have utility as light sources for the novel system. The LEDs are compact low power devices that make the system cheaper and easily transportable. However their light output is several orders of magnitude lower than that of lasers and they have much greater beam divergence. The spectra of both LED light sources are graphically depicted in and show the out of band emissions near 450 nm from the LEDs. The out of band LED emission can interfere with the water fluorescence emission and requires optical absorption filters to reduce to a negligible level.

It has been found that the spectra of fluorescence emission from the DOCs in water for the laser 266 nm and the LED 265 nm excitation are similar.

The measured LED fluorescence intensity is at least one twentieth of LIF intensity and can be increased through judicious use of higher LED power optical system design and signal processing

Optical filtering is required to reduce out of band emission from the UV LED. Optical filtering is used in the fluorescence collection optical path to reduce the strong excitation optical scatter from interfering with the DOC fluorescence emission. For example the excitation scatter Rayleigh and Mie scatter at 265 nm will be seen in the spectrometer output both at 265 nm and at the second order output of the grating at 2 265 nm 530 nm which can interfere with the first grating order of the fluorescence emission near 500 nm. An optical absorption filter such as BK 7 glass was used to reduce the second order 265 nm to a negligible level.

More particularly a BK 7 or similar optical absorption glass filter is used in the emission arm of the system to reduce the optical scatter Rayleigh and Mie scatter of the LED beam in the water in order to not interfere with the organics fluorescence spectrum at 500 nm and to inhibit the second order scatter of the LED from getting into the spectrometer.

Moreover the LED output power can be increased to improve the fluorescence signal and the UV LED can be used in pulsed mode to improve the signal to noise ratio.

Examples of successful detection of water DOCs using the UV LEDs are shown in for detection of lake water and tap water in .
