The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

This invention is for a common payload rail for securing an added payload capability to increase the versatility of unmanned vehicles UV . More particularly this invention secures an added payload capability externally to unmanned systems such as unmanned undersea vehicles UUVs and unmanned sea surface vehicles USVs with minimal modifications required to the internals of the unmanned system.

Contemporary methods for increasing or improving the payloads for UUVs usually involve the insertion of additional payloads within the system. This procedure frequently required space that may not be available and often involved extensive and costly modifications to internal systems in the vehicle. Later developed external payloads for USVs are generally suspended by support systems and towed behind the vehicle. The added on support and handling systems are usually unique and expensive to construct and install and can compromise the effectiveness of the host unmanned UV.

Thus in accordance with this inventive concept a need has been recognized in the state of the art for an efficient capability to directly mount a variety of external payloads to a submerged vessel or the underside of a surface vessel or on an outrigger off the side of the vessel via a rapidly and inexpensively installed common payload rail having the payloads designed for selective connection and disconnection.

The present invention provides a common payload rail to connect external payloads to a UV such as a UUV or USV. The common payload rail has a vehicle interface module having a conforming surface rigidly secured to the unmanned vehicle and feed through conduits. A functionality module is secured to the vehicle interface module and has internal interfacing components to minimize or eliminate any modifications to the payload and vehicle. A payload interface module having feed through conduits is secured to the functionality module and has longitudinally extending rail structure sized to engage correspondingly shaped longitudinally extending receiving means on the payload. The longitudinally extending rail structure is shaped to extend into the longitudinally extending receiving means on the payload to arrest lateral displacement between the payload interface module and the payload. At least one securing mechanism on the payload interface module is disposed to engage the payload to arrest longitudinal displacement between the payload interface module and the payload. The feed through conduits extending through the payload interface module and the vehicle interface module receive select ones of electrical conductors and optical fibers for power and data transmission and other communication requirements of the payload functionality module and unmanned vehicle. Some of the feed through conduits can include tubes to transfer fluids between the payload functionality module and unmanned vehicle. The vehicle interface module functionality module and payload interface module have essentially protuberance free outer surfaces provided with tapered leading and trailing edges to reduce hydrodynamic drag. The longitudinally extending rail structure has a cross sectional L shape and the longitudinally extending receiving means is an L shaped channel sized to slideably receive the L shaped longitudinally extending rail structure. Preferably the longitudinally extending rail structure is a pair of upward extending sliding rail structures extending in an inverted oppositely facing L shaped cross sectional configuration and longitudinally extending on the payload interface module. The longitudinally extending receiving means is shaped as a pair of L shaped channels that longitudinally extend in the lower part of the bottom assembly of the payload. The L shaped channels are slightly larger than the pair of L shaped sliding rail structures to allow the L shaped sliding rail structures to be inserted in and contiguously slid within the L shaped channels. The internal components of the functionality module can include a variety of self contained internal power source components to power its own internal components and the external payload. Computer data and signal processing components including data storage components to store and process the data sensed and collected by the payload can be included and sensor components can be included to provide input data to augment the unmanned vehicle and the external payload the computer components including data processing and data storage components may also be arranged to make the functionality module a payload of its own.

These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.

Referring to common payload rail of the invention is used to externally mount a variety of payloads submerged in water on an unmanned vehicle UV such as an unmanned undersea vehicle UUV or an unmanned surface vehicle . Common payload rail provides a means to secure and add payload capability externally to host vehicle UVs with minimal effort and virtually no internal modifications of the UVs and no requirements to occupy space inside the UVs. In other words common payload rail attaches externally to the surface of host vehicles such as UUV or USV as well as on manned vessels and crafts and then provides a standard mechanical electrical electronic and hydraulic mating surface for external payloads that are designed and built to meet the common mating interface standard of common payload rail .

Referring also to common payload rail is schematically depicted as having three mutually connectable modules. These modules a vehicle interface module a functionality module and a payload interface module can be tailored to meet the needs of many different payloads on a wide variety of UVs. In this regard the leading and trailing edges of modules and can be tapered and the longitudinal and lateral cross sectional configurations of modules and can be appropriately hydrodynamically shaped along their longitudinal lengths to minimize hydrodynamic drag to further minimize adverse impacts on the handling and performance of UV .

Vehicle interface module can be considered as an extension of UV and is preferably made from strong corrosion resistant or non corrosive materials to support the static and dynamic loads of modules and and payload . Vehicle interface module has an essentially protuberance free outer surface provided with a tapered leading edge A and trailing edge B to reduce hydrodynamic drag of payload rail . Vehicle interface module has an inner conforming surface shaped to accommodate and be secured to the specific UV of interest. This conforming surface can be attached to or fastened onto UV via a number of different means alone or in combination. For example these means can include epoxy and other strong adhesives adhered to and cured between conforming surface and the surface of UV and or securing surface to the surface of UV with sealed screws bolts or other appropriate fasteners. shows yet another way of attaching surface of vehicle interface module to a torpedo shaped UUV using two tensioned metal bands that are connected to vehicle interface module and extend around the circumference of UUV . The common payload rail is thereby fastened to UUV by bands

Vehicle interface module has one or more feed through conduits extending through it and between UV and payload rail to receive select ones of electrical conductors and optical fibers for at least some of the power and data transmission and communication requirements of payload functionality module and UV . Some of conduits also can be used as tubes to transfer at least some of fluids such as liquid and gaseous petroleum fuel products or other gases among payload functionality module and UV .

Functionality module is securely connected to vehicle interface module by any of a wide variety of well known means and is also preferably made from strong corrosion resistant or non corrosive materials to support the static and dynamic loads of payload interface module and payload . Functionality module preferably has a protuberance free outer surface having a tapered leading edge A and trailing edge B to create an elongate strut like streamlined shape for reduction of hydrodynamic drag of payload rail and to reduce the effects of payload rail on the dynamic handling of UV .

Referring to functionality module can contain internal components that can help efficiently perform functions of payload rail that expedite its successful operation. These internal components do not interfere with payload rail as it quickly interfaces with payload and the host UV and require no or minimal modifications to either of them. These functional components of functionality module can include but are not limited to self contained internal power source components such as battery power fuel cell power or more exotic sources like flywheel inertial stored power to provide power to both its own internal components as well as for external payload general and custom analog and digital computer data and signal processing components including data storage components to process payload data and its own generated data and produce effects as required sensor components that can themselves provide input data to augment the UV or the external payload in effect making common payload rail a payload of its own and effectors and actuator components to produce ambient effects as needed such as chaff or other ejections acoustical optical effects drag reduction etc.

Functionality module can also contain buoyancy compensation components that can include small reservoir tanks miniature pumps valves actuators and piping. These buoyancy compensation components can be appropriately actuated to modify the impact of the assembled payload rail and payload on the center of gravity and buoyancy of UV and consequently its handling and performance. Functionality module can also include appropriate means for isolation of the effects of vibrations throughout payload interface module and vehicle interface module to dampen vibrations from UV to payload or vice versa. This isolation can minimize impact on sensor components or those sensors of UV and payload . The isolation means can also have electrical electro magnetic magnetic and or acoustical components to minimize impact of the effects of one system or the other and if necessary shield and isolate any emissions or emanations from one body to another and or compensate for these effects to yield an overall lower detectable radiated signal to remote sensing devices. Components and can be appropriately placed in functionality module by one skilled in the art to assure acceptable ballasting center of gravity buoyancy trim and hydrodynamic handling characteristics among payload rail payload and UV and to otherwise make available their intended functional capabilities. It is therefore understood that the arrangement of such components depicted in is to facilitate an understanding of this inventive concept and is not to be regarded as being limiting.

Signal and power connectivity is provided between and among internal components external payload and UV . This includes internal wiring and connectors embedded in both interface modules and . This also includes appropriate units for electrical optical fluidic hydraulic opto electronic and electro magnetic communications and passing of data through feed through conduits in payload interface module between external payload and payload rail and through feed through conduits between UV and payload rail . The internal wiring and connectors are fabricated installed and interconnected using materials and procedures well established in the art.

Referring to and structural and mechanical support of payload on UV is provided for by payload interface module that is rigidly secured to functionality module . Payload interface module is preferably made from strong corrosion resistant or non corrosive materials to support the load of payload . Payload interface module also has an essentially protuberance free outer surface provided with a tapered leading edge A and trailing edge B to reduce hydrodynamic drag of payload rail . One or more feed through conduits extending through payload interface module and between UV and payload rail receive select ones of electrical conductors and or optical fibers for at least some of the power data and or communication needs of payload functionality module and UV . Some of feed through conduits as well as feed through conduits may find use as transfer tubes for various liquids and gasses among payload functionality module and UV .

Payload interface module of payload rail assures that payload remains securely in place during operation and that payload can be easily and quickly installed and removed. Payload interface module has a pair of upward extending sliding rail structures made of metal or other rugged strong material extending in an inverted oppositely facing L shaped cross sectional configuration. L shaped sliding rail structures of payload interface module longitudinally extend all the way or at least a portion of the way along the length of module to. L shaped sliding rail structures are disposed to be slideably received in a pair of slightly larger L shaped channels that longitudinally extend along a lower part of a bottom assembly of payload . The slightly larger shape of L shaped channels allows L shaped sliding rail structures to be inserted into and contiguously slid within the L shaped channels of bottom assembly . The locations of the L shaped channels and the rail structures on module and bottom assembly can be reversed to produce substantially the same results.

Depending on their relative lengths L shaped channels in bottom assembly can contain some or all of the entire lengths of L shaped structures of payload interface module . The contiguous abutting relationship between structures and channels laterally secure and arrest payload on UV via payload rail . Longitudinal securing of payload on UV via payload rail is assured by including at least one securing mechanism in payload interface module . Securing mechanism can be quickly actuated to engage bottom assembly of payload to longitudinally secure payload to payload rail and thus UV .

Referring also to two exemplary securing mechanisms designated A and B are shown although more or less than two such mechanisms can be used so long as the number chosen can securely couple payload rail to payload . Each securing mechanism A B in payload interface module has an interconnected hex key geared sub mechanism rotated to selectively outwardly and inwardly displace an extensible pin to engage recess or . Securing mechanism A is shown having its pin in the retracted position not engaging recess in lower part of bottom assembly . Securing mechanism B is shown having its pin in the extended position engaging recess in lower part of bottom assembly . The engagement of recess in bottom assembly of payload by pin of securing mechanism B in payload rail prevents payload from longitudinally sliding relatively to UV see also and simultaneously the mechanical co action between L shaped sliding rail structures and L shaped channels prevents virtually any lateral or yawing motions. Thus payload is secured to UV via common payload rail of the invention.

The pair of longitudinally extending L shaped rail structures and mating L shaped channels could be reversed on module and bottom assembly of payload or one of each could be used. The rail structures and mating channels could have other configurations including separated structural extensions that allow for quick engagement and release of payload to payload rail . These could be one or more rounded or square projections on either payload interface module or payload that can engage round or square shaped channels or a series of projections engaging clamps or clasping receptacles or other engaging means. Electric or unassisted magnetic engaging components may also be used between payload interface module and bottom assembly of payload . A feed through conduit for mating conductors tubes and connectors is provided in bottom assembly for the transfer of electromagnetic power and data as well as fluids between payload rail and payload .

The arrangement of L shaped rail structures and mating L shaped channels can have securing mechanisms provided with sub assemblies that can be quickly manually actuated to pull any pins that are engaging any recesses in bottom assembly . This permits payload to be quickly longitudinally displaced to release structures from channels . The current payload can be quickly removed and replaced by another payload without any other mechanical complications. Quick disconnect securing mechanisms other than those described above also can be used to secure payload to payload rail and will readily suggest themselves to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains. The literature is replete with such securing means and fasteners whose design and specifications are openly published to become a standard to which bottom assemblies on different UV payloads can then be designed and constructed.

Common payload rail of the invention can be adapted to UVs of many different types and can also be used with manned vehicles as well. shows a rapidly changeable payload mounted above and on the dorsal centerline of a UUV submerged in water and shows a submerged external payload mounted on USV below its longitudinally extending centerline. One or more of these payloads could be mounted as shown and or in an outrigger disposition by one or more payload rails provided that appropriate ballasting is provided to counterweight their effect. All of these adaptations of payload rail can increase performance capabilities of the host vehicles in a way that enables current and future host vehicles to benefit from continuing technological advances and allows them to better meet future requirements in cost effective and timely ways.

Common payload rail of the invention provides an uncomplicated and reliable bridging mechanism that allows coupling of essentially different arbitrary payloads externally to a wide variety of host vehicles utilizing a standard coupling approach.

Common payload rail will increase flexibility for utilizing payloads with a much broader number of varied UVs at potentially significant savings if payloads are designed and constructed to meet the open interface specification. Payload rail can allow external placement of components that have been carried internally in the current generation of UVs leaving internal spaces for other components.

Payload rail can increase design efficiency and reduce overall system acquisition costs by providing a standard interface design using components that can be designed separately from the UV itself and can be mated to any UV that incorporates the same interface design. This feature of payload rail provides enhanced design flexibility and allows for the interchangeability of components without having to open up or make modifications to the UV. Payload rail allows a large number of future payloads to be developed and attached with ease to older generation UVs that are backfitted with the same interface design. In addition when needed multiple ones of payload rail supporting multiple payloads can be mounted on the external surfaces of UVs possibly at different orientations that may depend on geometries of the UVs.

Modifications and alternate embodiments of common payload rail of the invention may be adapted and differently configured to accommodate different host vehicles under different operational conditions. The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Payload rail of the invention is an uncomplicated and reliable application of good engineering for improving operational readiness and effectiveness of UVs and their externally mounted payloads.

It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
