Gilhuly Anh Ngoc Van Steven M. Rahn Gary P. Mousseau and Mihal Lazaridis. Each of the foregoing patent applications is incorporated by reference herein.

The present patent disclosure generally relates to communications networks. More particularly and not by way of any limitation the present patent disclosure is directed to an architecture for service delivery in a network environment including an IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS network.

Delivery of email messages to mobile handheld devices is well known. However current techniques for achieving such delivery are generally not concerned with the latest 3Generation Partnership Project 3GPP standards that specify a new all IP based network architecture referred to as the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS .

Although IMS provides a well defined architecture with respect to session control and the underlying network infrastructure it is silent regarding the service architecture inasmuch as service providers are responsible for architecting their services over the IMS network. One of the issues is ensuring reliability and scalability of the service architecture with respect to the services to be delivered over the IMS network.

The present patent disclosure is broadly directed to a network architecture and associated systems and methods for facilitating delivery of redirected data items over a communications network to a mobile communications device wherein the communications network includes an IMS network. In one embodiment disclosed herein is a service gateway decomposition method operable in an IMS environment comprising one or more of the following features providing a service gateway controller SGC operable to effectuate a signaling interface with respect to at least one remote services server providing one or more service gateways SGWs for effectuating a message transport interface with respect to the at least one remote services server and interfacing the SGC with the SGWs using a signaling architecture for controlling a message path over the IMS environment between the at least one remote services server and a service client associated therewith.

In another embodiment disclosed herein is an SGC node adapted to operate in an IMS network environment. The claimed embodiment comprises one or more of the following features means for effectuating a signaling interface with respect to at least one remote services server means for effectuating a signaling interface with respect to a service client executing on a mobile communications device wherein the service client is associated with the at least one remote services server and means for effectuating a signaling interface with respect to one or more SGW nodes to control a message path over the IMS network environment between the at least one remote services server and the service client associated therewith.

In a still further embodiment disclosed herein is an SGW node interoperable in association with an IMS network environment comprising one or more of the following features means for effectuating a message transport flow interface with respect to at least one remote services server means for effectuating a message transport flow interface with respect to a service client executing on a mobile communications device wherein the service client is associated with the at least one remote services server and means for effectuating a signaling interface with respect to one or more SGC nodes operable to control a message path over the IMS network environment between the at least one remote services server and the service client associated therewith.

In an additional aspect disclosed herein is a computer readable medium having program code thereon for execution by a processor of a network node e.g. an SGC operable in association with an IMS network environment. The claimed embodiment comprises one or more of the following features instructions for effectuating a signaling interface with respect to at least one remote services server instructions for effectuating a signaling interface with respect to a service client executing on a mobile communications device wherein the service client is associated with the at least one remote services server and instructions for effectuating a signaling interface with respect to one or more SGW nodes to control a message path over the IMS network environment between the at least one remote services server and the service client associated therewith.

Relatedly also disclosed is a computer readable medium having program code thereon for execution by a processor of a network node e.g. an SGW operable in association with an IMS network environment. The claimed embodiment comprises one or more of the following features instructions for effectuating a message transport interface with respect to at least one remote services server instructions for effectuating a message transport interface with respect to a service client executing on a mobile communications device wherein the service client is associated with the at least one remote services server and instructions for effectuating a signaling interface with respect to one or more service gateway controllers SGCs operable to control a message path over the IMS network environment between the at least one remote services server and the service client associated therewith.

A system and method of the present patent disclosure will now be described with reference to various examples of how the embodiments can best be made and used. Like reference numerals are used throughout the description and several views of the drawings to indicate like or corresponding parts wherein the various elements are not necessarily drawn to scale. Referring to the drawings and more particularly to depicted therein is an exemplary network communications environment including an enterprise network and an IMS network wherein one or more embodiments of the present patent disclosure may be practiced for purposes of facilitating delivery of data items to and from a mobile communications device . The enterprise network which may be a packet switched network can include one or more geographic sites and be organized as a local area network LAN wide area network WAN or metropolitan area network MAN et cetera for serving a plurality of corporate users. A number of application servers to N disposed as part of the enterprise network are operable to provide or effectuate a host of internal and external services such as email video mail Internet access corporate data access messaging calendaring and scheduling information management and the like. For instance reference numeral refers to a corporate email messaging system server. A diverse array of personal information appliances such as desktop computers e.g. computers through N laptop computers palmtop computers et cetera although not specifically shown in may be operably networked to one or more of the application servers i 1 2 . . . N with respect to the services supported in the enterprise network .

Additionally a remote services server RSS may be interfaced with the enterprise network for enabling a corporate user to access or effectuate any of the services from a remote location using the mobile communications device MCD . To facilitate redirection or replication of data items from an enterprise site e.g. from a desktop computer a user mailbox or some other location to MCD for a particular user specialized software may be provided that may be executed on the email server on RSS on a desktop computer or as a separate application server in the enterprise network . Regardless of how such software is provisioned within the enterprise network a client software component is operable to be executed on MCD to which user selectable data items may be redirected.

RSS may be coupled via a public packet switched network e.g. the Internet to the IMS core network that provides a delivery mechanism with respect to the data items that are processed to be redirected to MCD . In one embodiment MCD may be operably connected to the IMS network via a suitable access network infrastructure . As will be described in detail below the IMS network includes suitable service gateway functionality as an IMS service node i.e. application server operable to transmit the processed data items or portions thereof to MCD .

In general a variety of data items may be processed to be redirected over the IMS network. By way of example the data items may comprise email messages calendar events meeting notifications address or other personal data assistant PDA entries journal entries personal reminders Instant Messages IM multimedia notifications messages e.g. audio and or video clips or other items from an external network e.g. stock quotations news stories podcasts webcasts content downloads etc. that are pushed or otherwise provided to users . In one embodiment the data items to be redirected may be detected by way of a polling mechanism wherein specialized software such as software may be configured to poll for certain data items i.e. pull model on behalf of a user authorized for receiving redirected data items at a wireless user equipment UE device such as MCD . In an alternative embodiment a push model may be employed wherein the data items to be redirected may be detected based on receiving automatically generated notifications. Where the data items are stored in databases changes to such databases e.g. due to arrival of a new email updating of an address book etc. may be automatically provided to software i.e. without it having to poll for the changes via suitable advise requests such as those provided by Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI for example. Additionally regardless of whether a pull model or a push model is employed for detecting the data items an event driven scheme may also be provided such that redirection of a data item may be rendered dependent upon setting certain flags associated with user selectable events i.e. trigger events . That is in other words the redirection software may be turned on or turned off based on whether a trigger event has occurred and upon the occurrence of the event which may generate a signal that operates to set a trigger flag new data items may be continuously redirected i.e. without further global gating conditions . These user defined trigger events may include external events internal events and networked events or a combination thereof. Examples of external events include receiving a message from the user s MCD to begin redirection receiving a similar message from some external computer sensing that the user is no longer in the vicinity of the user s computer system or any other event that is external to the user s computer system. Internal events could be a calendar alarm screen saver activation keyboard timeout programmable timer or any other user defined event that is internal to the computer system executing the redirection software . Networked events are user defined messages that are transmitted from another computer coupled to the system executing the redirection software via a network e.g. a LAN to initiate redirection. These are just some of the examples of the types of user defined events that can trigger the redirector software to initiate redirection of data items to the user s MCD. As a further implementation a variety of filtering schemes may also be used for further modulating the redirection behavior regardless of whether the redirection software is disposed within the enterprise or at a standalone desktop computer or operable in association with an Internet email system. Accordingly the functionality of the redirection software may comprise one or more of the following 1 configure and set up one or more user defined trigger events which may be user specific time window specific etc. that will start redirection 2 configure the types of user data items for redirection and optionally configure a preferred list of message senders whose messages are to be redirected 3 configure the type and capabilities of the user s handheld equipment e.g. MCD 4 receive messages and signals from data item repackaging systems and the event generating systems and 5 command and control the redirection of the user selected data items to the user s MCD the repackaging systems. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other functions and processes not specifically enumerated e.g. processing of attachments encryption encoding transcoding compression etc. may also be integrated into or otherwise associated with the functionality of software .

Referring now to depicted therein is another view of a network communications environment A where an IMS network and an access network space are exemplified for purposes of facilitating service delivery in accordance with the teachings of the present patent disclosure. As illustrated the network communications environment A includes an access space comprised of a number of access technologies available to a plurality of UE devices through N. For purposes of the present disclosure a UE device may be any tethered or untethered communications device and may include any mobile personal computer e.g. laptops palmtops or handheld computing devices equipped with a suitable wireless modem or a mobile communications device e.g. cellular phones or data enabled handheld devices capable of receiving and sending messages web browsing et cetera or any enhanced PDA device or integrated information appliance capable of email video mail Internet access corporate data access messaging calendaring and scheduling information management and the like. Preferably the UE device is capable of operating in multiple modes in that it can engage in both circuit switched CS as well as packet switched PS communications and can transition from one mode of communications to another mode of communications without loss of continuity and consume one or more IMS based services. It will therefore be realized that any UE device through N may be deemed to be illustrative of MCD shown in .

The access space may be comprised of both CS and PS networks which may involve wireless technologies wireline technologies broadband access technologies etc. For example reference numeral refers to wireless technologies such as Global System for Mobile Communications GSM networks and Code Division Multiple Access CDMA networks although it is envisaged that the teachings hereof may be extended to any 3Generation Partnership Project 3GPP compliant cellular network e.g. 3GPP or 3GPP2 as well. Reference numeral refers to broadband access networks including wireless local area networks or WLANs Wi MAX networks as well as fixed networks such as DSL cable broadband etc. Thus for purposes of the present disclosure the access technologies may comprise radio access technologies selected from IEEE 802.11a technology IEEE 802.11b technology IEEE 802.11g technology IEEE 802.11n technology GSM EDGE Radio Access Network GERAN technology both CS and PS domains and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS technology and Evolution Data Optimized EVDO technology and so on. Additionally also exemplified as part of the access space is conventional wireline PSTN infrastructure illustrated in .

The access space including any CS based networks via suitable gateways is coupled to the IMS core network . As is well known the IMS core is operable according to the standards defined by the 3GPP and is designed to allow service providers manage a variety of services that can be delivered via IP over any network type wherein IP is used to transport both bearer traffic and Session Initiation Protocol SIP based signaling traffic. Broadly IMS is a framework for managing the applications i.e. services and networks i.e. access that is capable of providing multimedia services. IMS defines an application server as a network element that delivers services subscribers use e.g. voice call continuity VCC Push To Talk PTT etc. IMS manages applications by defining standardized interfaces and common control components that each application server AS is required to have e.g. subscriber profiles IMS mobility network access authentication service authorization charging and billing inter operator functions and interoperation with the legacy phone network.

It should be understood that whereas IMS is defined by the 3GPP standards body which mainly addresses GSM networks another group 3GPP2 is involved in defining a closely analogous architecture referred to as Multimedia Domain MMD . MMD is essentially an IMS for CDMA networks and since MMD and IMS are roughly equivalent the term IMS may be used in this present patent disclosure to refer collectively to both IMS and MMD where applicable. In addition fixed network standards for NGN Next Generation Networks that are based on and or reuse IMS are also being developed by bodies such as ETSI TISPAN Cablelabs and the ITU T. NGN and IMS are roughly equivalent and accordingly the term IMS may also be used in this present patent disclosure to refer collectively to both IMS and NGN where applicable.

Continuing to refer to reference numerals to N refer to a plurality of AS nodes also referred to as service gateways operable to support various services e.g. VCC PTT etc. alluded to hereinabove. Particularly AS node N embodies service gateway functionality that is operable to effectuate remote services delivery e.g. delivery of redirected data items such as email messages for instance using the IMS infrastructure. Accordingly AS node N may be operably coupled to RSS in an exemplary embodiment which in turn may be disposed in an enterprise network as illustrated in .

Furthermore the IMS layer B may also include other functions that facilitate call routing relative to a CSN such as a PLMN. For instance a Breakout Gateway Control Function BGCF includes routing functionality based on E.164 phone numbers when communicating to a phone in the PLMN. A Media Gateway Controller Function MGCF includes functionality for effectuating call control protocol conversion between SIP and ISDN User Part ISUP .

In addition to HSS the service application layer C includes one or more AS nodes e.g. AS with appropriate interfacing with the entities in the IMS layer B for effectuating services or applications. As pointed out previously an AS node i.e. service gateway may be provided for effectuating delivery of redirected data items using the IMS infrastructure. depicts a network architectural embodiment that illustrates various entities their logical elements and service flows for a formal model of providing email service delivery over IMS. A service gateway SGW including a protocol translation conversion functionality is coupled to one or more email service server ESS entities disposed in an external network via an interface that uses either standard or proprietary protocols. In turn ESS entities which may include the redirection software functionality described in the foregoing sections are coupled to one or more mail messaging systems e.g. messaging system that may include a plurality of email servers through N. Each email server is operable to serve a number of user mailboxes MB . To facilitate scalability and reliability the messaging system may be architected as disclosed in the co pending commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 098 083 filed Mar. 14 2002 entitled SCALABLE AND SECURE MESSAGING SYSTEM FOR A WIRELESS NETWORK now published as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002 0132609 in the names of Allan D. Lewis Tabitha K. Ferguson James A. Godfrey Carl L. Cherry and Bill Yuan incorporated by reference herein.

By way of example the interface may employ a proprietary protocol such as Email Transport Protocol ETP for transmitting processed information between SGW and ESS . Alternatively the interface may employ standards based protocols such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP or an Extended Markup Language XML based protocol. Reference numeral refers to exemplary signaling path via IMS between SGW and Service Client SC software executing on MCD effectuated using SIP. Reference numeral refers to the message flow path between MCD and SGW for transmitting the redirected data items. Interface is a standard email application interface that allows interaction between user and MCD wherein the received data items may be presented new data items may be created or reply messages may be generated.

To facilitate routing the IMS administrative domain relies on a set of Initial Filter Criteria IFC when an S CSCF node in the IMS layer B is mapped to a corresponding SGW and associated ESS. The routing rules to find and or assign a suitable ESS may be embedded in the IFC provisioned by either the network operator or the service provider. The information may be deployed in an HSS database statically wherein an assigned S CSCF node is operable to download the IFC from the HSS when a subscriber s UE e.g. MCD registers.

It will be realized that the embodiment illustrated in is exemplary of email service delivery in a session messaging mode wherein a separate media channel e.g. message flow path is provided. Alternatively email service delivery may also be effectuated in a page mode also referred to as immediate messaging mode wherein the redirected data item information is carried within a signaling channel e.g. signaling flow path .

The IMS delivery model described in for redirecting data items is relatively simple and straightforward to implement in a number of different network environments. It will be realized however that since an assigned S CSCF node is operable to determine routing information that is static as embedded within the IFC that populate an HSS database the IMS administrative domain is not capable of dynamically and intelligently monitor and adjust a transmission path between the ESS and a UE device based on the current runtime circumstances of the ESS in order to maintain a reliable service path. In other words reliance on the use of the static bindings provisioned via the IFC to reach a destined ESS directly may cause reliability and scalability issues in certain network implementations.

On the other hand implementing H.248 as the signaling protocol for the service network between SGCs and SGWs does not allow the service network to become part of the IMS infrastructure inasmuch as the SGW nodes are logically IMS independent entities and as such exist outside the IMS administrative domain. However in a further variation the H.248 Megaco signaling communication may be adapted to run over SIP wherein an H.248 context will be treated as a SIP extension that allows integration between H.248 and SIP.

Microprocessor may also interface with further device subsystems such as auxiliary input output I O serial port display keyboard keypad speaker microphone random access memory RAM a short range communications subsystem and any other device subsystems e.g. timer mechanisms generally labeled as reference numeral . To control access an interface operable with a Universal Subscriber Identity Module or Removable User Identity Module USIM RUIM may also be provided in communication with the microprocessor . In one implementation USIM RUIM interface is operable with a USIM RUIM card having a number of key configurations and other information such as identification and subscriber related data.

Operating system software and applicable service logic software may be embodied in a persistent storage module i.e. non volatile storage such as Flash memory . In one implementation Flash memory may be segregated into different areas e.g. storage area for computer programs e.g. service processing logic as well as data storage regions such as device state address book other personal information manager PIM data and other data storage areas generally labeled as reference numeral . A transport stack may be provided to effectuate one or more appropriate radio packet transport protocols. In addition service client logic operable to effectuate signaling and message pathways with respect to delivery and processing of redirected data items is also provided. It should be appreciated that the various operations set forth herein either on the UE device side ESS side or on the IMS SGC SGW side may be accomplished via a number of means including software e.g. program code firmware hardware or in any combination usually in association with a processing system. Where the processes are embodied in software such software may comprise program instructions that form a computer program product instructions on a computer readable medium uploadable service application software or software downloadable from a remote station and the like.

Accordingly in one exemplary embodiment the structure and functionality of UE device may comprise one or more of the following means for contacting an SGC disposed in an IMS network by SC executing thereon wherein the SGC is operably coupled to a plurality of service gateways SGWs means for discovering a particular SGW assigned with respect to SC on wireless UE device and means for receiving from the particular SGW one or more data items redirected to the wireless UE device by a remote services server associated therewith.

It is believed that the operation and construction of the embodiments of the present patent application will be apparent from the Detailed Description set forth above. While the exemplary embodiments shown and described may have been characterized as being preferred it should be readily understood that various changes and modifications could be made therein without departing from the scope of the present disclosure as set forth in the following claims.
