title: Integrated speech recognition and semantic classification
abstract: A novel system integrates speech recognition and semantic classification, so that acoustic scores in a speech recognizer that accepts spoken utterances may be taken into account when training both language models and semantic classification models. For example, a joint association score may be defined that is indicative of a correspondence of a semantic class and a word sequence for an acoustic signal. The joint association score may incorporate parameters such as weighting parameters for signal-to-class modeling of the acoustic signal, language model parameters and scores, and acoustic model parameters and scores. The parameters may be revised to raise the joint association score of a target word sequence with a target semantic class relative to the joint association score of a competitor word sequence with the target semantic class. The parameters may be designed so that the semantic classification errors in the training data are minimized.

Speech understanding is a growing field that involves enabling a machine to interpret the meaning of spoken language. One aspect of speech understanding is spoken utterance classification which seeks to apply semantic classification to spoken utterances. Spoken utterance classification typically involves a two step process. First a spoken utterance is processed with techniques of automatic speech recognition using a language model to determine the sequence of words expressed in the spoken utterance. Second the sequence of words is processed with techniques of semantic classification using a classification model to parse their meaning.

Each of these two steps has the potential to work imperfectly and produce erroneous results. Since the output from the speech recognition process forms the input to the semantic classification process this means any erroneous results of the speech recognition process will be perpetuated in the semantic classification process reflecting the old computing aphorism of garbage in garbage out . The risk of erroneous final output from the semantic classification process is therefore compounded. The potential for error has typically been addressed by training the language model to reduce errors in determining the sequences of words from spoken utterances and training the classification model to reduce errors in determining the semantic classes of the word sequences.

The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A novel system integrates speech recognition and semantic classification so that the acoustic scores in the speech recognizer that accepts the original spoken utterances may be taken into account when training both language models and semantic classification models in a variety of embodiments. For example a joint association score may be defined that is indicative of a correspondence of a semantic class and a word sequence for an acoustic signal. The joint association score may incorporate parameters that are applied to features of the word sequence for signal to class modeling of the acoustic signal. It may also incorporate language model parameters and scores as well as acoustic model parameters and scores. A target word sequence may be identified that has a highest joint association score with a target semantic class. Competitor word sequences may also be identified that each have a highest remaining joint association score with any remaining semantic class. The parameters may then be revised to raise the joint association score of the target word sequence with the target semantic class relative to the joint association score of the competitor word sequence with the target semantic class. The semantic model weighting parameters and language model parameters are designed so that the semantic classification errors in the training data are minimized.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in the background.

Method begins with step of defining a joint association score indicative of a correspondence of a semantic class and a word sequence for an acoustic signal wherein the joint association score incorporates one or more weighting parameters that are applied to one or more features of the word sequence for signal to class modeling of the acoustic signal. The signal to class modeling may include speech recognition modeling language modeling semantic classification modeling or any or all three of them in combination. The signal to class modeling may incorporate model parameters and scores for any of speech recognition modeling language modeling semantic classification modeling. Referring to discriminative training system one or more acoustic signals may be provided and subjected to an acoustic decoder or preprocessor to provide a set of n best word sequences . For example in the present illustrative embodiment acoustic decoder or preprocessor may convert an acoustic signal X into an acoustic cepstra sequence. The set of n best word sequences may be generated for example using a lattice of word sequences which provides a compact representation of n best word sequences because it can match an acoustic signal with a word sequence by summing up acoustic scores of all paths of the speech lattices that correspond to possible word sequences for the acoustic signal. The n best word sequences are used to define the initial weighting parameters of the discriminative acoustic trainer which render an updated language model for automatic speech recognition. That is discriminative acoustic trainer may use minimum classification error discriminative training to update the acoustic model parameters from baseline acoustic model . In particular discriminative acoustic trainer may use weighting parameter update equations that are formed by optimizing a minimum classification error function as discussed in more detail below. Using the update equations discriminative acoustic trainer produces updated language model .

The updated language model and a set of semantic classes are used initially with a baseline semantic model to define the weighting parameters of discriminative semantic trainer which define an updated semantic model . Joint association scorer uses an acoustic score and a word string probability for a given word sequence relative to an acoustic signal from updated language model and a class posterior probability for a given semantic class with respect to a word sequence from updated semantic model . Once a set of joint association scores are obtained they may be compared with each other by joint association score comparator . These aspects are further described as follows.

For a given acoustic signal the acoustic scorer or preprocessor interprets the acoustic signal with reference to the baseline language model to generate an n best list of word sequences W i.e. W . . . W. For each of the word sequences W a word string probability P W may be calculated based on the weighting parameters of the language model or . For each of the word sequences W an acoustic score of the associated acoustic signal P X W can also be obtained by summing up the acoustic scores of all the paths on an associated speech lattice that yield the word sequence Wfor the given acoustic signal X. At discriminative semantic trainer the class posterior probability P C W of a semantic class Cfrom among the semantic classes matching a word sequence Wmay be modeled with a maximum entropy model an illustrative example of which is provided as follows using semantic classification model weighting parameters and lexical features fthat serve as language model weighting parameters 

As an example of the lexical features f these may for example include n gram features such as bigrams where n 2 

A goal of discriminative training system is to define a semantic classification decision rule that assigns the best semantic class to any acoustic signal such as a spoken utterance that is a rule that uses weighting parameters trained through one or more revisions to render a reduced classification error or a minimum classification error. Put another way the goal is to devise a semantic classification decision rule such that 

This can be expanded as a function of word string probability P W acoustic signal P X W and class posterior probability P C W as 

Method according to the present illustrative embodiment incorporates the insight that this equation for the semantic classification decision rule can be reliably estimated as 

This includes reducing the class posterior probability to the form P C W rather than P C W X and weighting the acoustic signal P X W with an exponential term of the inverse of L a function representing the total semantic classification loss approximating the semantic classification error rate exhibited by the language model and the semantic model . Therefore the maximum of the product of the three probabilities as taken in Eq. 5 provides the least semantic classification error rate.

Eq. 5 for the semantic classification decision rule can be rewritten in an equivalent logarithmic form as follows 

It is this joint association score that is defined by joint association scorer in discriminative training system in the illustrative embodiment of . Joint association score D C W X allows the equation defining the semantic classification decision rule to be simplified as follows 

Joint association score D C W X serves as a class discriminant function that rates the joint association of the semantic class Cfrom among the semantic classes and the word sequence Wfrom among the n best word sequences for the racoustic signal or spoken utterance X. Joint association score D C W X therefore incorporates one or more weighting parameters that are applied to one or more features of the word sequence Wfrom at least one of the baseline language model the updated language model the baseline semantic model or the updated semantic model .

Once the joint association scores D C W X are evaluated by joint association scorer they may be compared with each other by joint association score comparator and a particular word sequence from the n best set of word sequences may be identified as the target word sequence Wthat has the highest joint association score with a target semantic class Cthat is the correct semantic class for the racoustic signal X as in step of method in . The target word sequence Wmay be identified as the word sequence that satisfies the equation 

The target word sequence Wis therefore the most likely sentence to yield the correct semantic classification for the acoustic signal X independently of whether or not target word sequence Wwould provide the closest matching transcription as determined by a system for performing automatic speech recognition in isolation from considerations of semantic classification.

With the target word sequence Wthus identified one or more additional word sequences from among n best word sequences other than the target word sequence W may be matched iteratively with semantic classes from among semantic classes and thus identified as competitor word sequences. This is done by identifying the remaining word sequence that has the highest remaining joint association score with any available semantic class other than the target semantic class C. This may be done iteratively each time removing the identified competitor word sequences and their matching semantic classes from subsequent consideration and then finding the remaining word sequence that has the highest joint association with any remaining semantic class. This iterative rule for identifying competitor word sequences can be represented as follows 

In Eq. 10 C C C . . . C and W . . . W where denotes set difference. The word sequences from among the n best word sequences are identified as matching corresponding classes from among semantic classes C based on the rule 

Therefore each of the n competitor word sequences Whas the joint association score D C W X with its matching semantic class. Any of a wide variety of number n competitor word sequences may be identified from 1 up to enough to exhaust the available supply of either word sequences in n best word sequences or semantic classes from among semantic classes C .

Following a minimum classification error framework in the present illustrative embodiment a class specific misclassification function d X and a class specific loss function l d X may be associated with each acoustic signal X as part of identifying errors of semantic classification that may be remedied by revising the weighting parameters. The class specific loss function l d X is a function of the class specific misclassification function d X that is configured to approximate a binary decision for each acoustic signal Xas to whether the acoustic signal has been correctly classified or not. For example the class specific loss function l d X may be structured as a sigmoid function that approximates 0 when the acoustic signal Xis assigned to the correct semantic class and that approximates 1 when the acoustic signal Xis assigned to the incorrect semantic class. As an illustrative example these functions may be defined as follows 

The parameters and may be selected empirically to improve performance in distinguishing between correct and erroneous classifications as will be understood by those skilled in the art. is a positive constant that controls the size of the learning window and the learning rate while is a constant measuring the offset of d X from 0. For example in one experimental set the loss function was found to be optimized with a value for a of approximately 1.2 and a value for of approximately 20 although these values can be set across a fairly wide range with only a modest amount of loss of performance. It was found in one illustrative embodiment to provide some advantage to set to associate additional loss to samples where the class specific loss function l d X was otherwise close to 0.5 that is indicated to be indeterminate between correct and erroneous classification.

The formula for the class specific misclassification function d X also uses N which is the number of competitor word sequences which may be up to one less than the number of word sequences in the n best word sequences . It also uses as a smoothing function. d X is configured to be very small when the semantic classification of acoustic signal Xis correct in which case l d X is close to 0 while d X is configured to be very large when the semantic classification of acoustic signal Xis incorrect in which case l d X is close to 1. The class specific loss function l d X may be summed over r to formulate a total classification loss function L that approximates the total semantic classification error rate as follows 

The total classification loss function L thus defined may be targeted for reduction or minimization as the criterion for revising the weighting parameters to reduce or optimize the semantic classification error rate. This may therefore serve as the basis for revising one or more of the weighting parameters to raise the joint association score D C W X of the target word sequence Wwith the target semantic class Crelative to the joint association score of the competitor word sequences Wwith the target semantic class C as in step of method . This may be followed by a step to evaluate whether the language model weighting parameters and or the semantic classification weighting parameters are approaching convergence as at decision node of method . If they are not yet converging these steps may be repeated iteratively while if they are converging the process may be concluded as at endpoint of method .

As one specific illustrative example of how the revision of weighting parameters as in step works in practice it may be considered in the context of training a specific set of spoken utterance training data acoustic signals Xand selected target semantic classes Cin the specific context of an Airline Travel Information System ATIS in which a selected set of semantic classes C from among semantic classes are assigned to different word sequences Wfrom among n best word sequences formed by automatic speech recognition of training data acoustic signals and the assignments are iteratively reviewed and their weighting parameters revised for the speech recognition language model and semantic classification model.

As the first step of the training stage the target word sequences Ware identified from among the best word sequences for having the highest joint association scores with the target semantic classes C as in step of method of . This also represents going through discriminative training system to joint association score comparator for a first iteration. For example one particular target semantic class Cmay be labeled GRD SRV ATL and may represent the semantic meaning What is the ground transportation in Atlanta The goal of the ATIS system in this case is to train the speech recognition language model and semantic classification model so that as closely as possible any spoken utterance by a customer with the semantic meaning of What is the ground transportation in Atlanta will be matched to the semantic class GRD SRV ATL despite an expected range of variations not only in voice and accent but also in wording. Since the semantic meaning is the type to be expected from an open ended query the semantic classification should be able to reliably distinguish this particular semantic meaning from other potentially unrelated semantic meanings associated with other spoken utterances some of which may be rather similar in its wording or other acoustic aspects. Accordingly one of the spoken utterance training data acoustic signals is provided that is rendered into the word sequence What is the ground transportation in Atlanta and system identifies this word sequence as the target word sequence Was in step of method of . This identification includes joint association scorer defining a joint association score for the target word sequence Wand the target semantic class C and joint association score comparator identifying the joint association score D C W X for the particular target word sequence Was being the highest joint association score of any of the available word sequences for this particular semantic class.

Then as in step of method system identifies a competitor word sequence Wfrom among the remaining word sequences W . . . W i.e. those word sequences other than the target word sequence W such that competitor word sequence Whas the highest joint association score D C W X with any of the remaining semantic classes other than the target semantic class C that is from among the remaining semantic classes C C C . . . C which is identified as C. This may continue through further iterations identifying a subsequent competitor word sequence Wthat has a highest remaining joint association score D C W X with any of the then remaining semantic classes C C C . . . C and so forth and may continue until there are either no word sequences left or no semantic classes left. The spoken utterance acoustic signal Xmay then be assigned to the semantic class Cthat has the highest joint association score D C W X with any word sequence Wfrom among the n best word sequences .

One result of this process is that the target word sequence Wis the one word sequence from the n best word sequences that is most likely to match with the correct target semantic class C while the first competitor word sequence Wis the one word sequence most likely to yield an erroneous semantic class. This mechanism of matching the word sequences with semantic classes is therefore effective at matching the closest competitor against a target word sequence for discriminative training so that the system can be trained foremost to discern the correct word sequence in comparison with its closest competitor i.e. the word sequence otherwise most likely to be erroneously identified.

The importance of this system for focusing discriminative training on the closest competitor is demonstrated for the present illustrative example in Table 1 below which represents experimentally generated joint association scores 

In this example the joint association score of the target word sequence Wwith the correct target semantic class C GRD SRV ATL is D C W X 20.04. On the other hand the joint association score of competitor word sequence Wwith the wrong semantic class FARE ATL is D C W X 17.56 higher than D C W X .

In particular the competitor word sequence Whappens to include the word round which rhymes with ground at approximately the same position in the statement as word ground in the reference statement for the target class tending the automatic speech recognition to evaluate these two statements to be closer together than the target word sequence Wis to the reference word sequence despite Wbeing the word sequence that actually has a matching semantic meaning. This highlights the shortcoming of traditional systems involving two isolated steps of automatic speech recognition and subsequent semantic classification of a word sequence provided to the semantic classifier without the benefit of any additional information about the source acoustic signal and the capability of embodiments disclosed herein to resolve this issue.

Hence the classification decision rule acting on Xinitially yields an erroneous semantic class as indicated by the acoustic signal Xbeing matched with a different word sequence W than the target word sequence W as it was previously identified for having the highest joint association scores with the target semantic classes C. These results also provide guidance for how the parameters that went into that classification need to be revised to raise the joint association score of the target word sequence with the target semantic class and to decrease the joint association score of the competitor word sequences with the target semantic class.

The weighting parameters for both the language model and the semantic model may be revised subsequent to the minimum classification error training by applying a steepest descent optimization technique in one illustrative embodiment. For the language model the weighting para meters may be defined as logarithms of probabilities applied to lexical features such as n grams that reduce or minimize the total loss function L . In particular the language model LM weighting parameters in the particular example of lexical bigrams may be defined as p log P w w with a revised weighting parameter of revision iteration t 1 expressed relative to the prior form of the weighting parameter in the form of 

This isolates the partial derivative of the class specific misclassification function d X of EQ. 12 above with respect to the language model weighting parameters P which can be resolved as 

Here n W ww denotes the number of times the bigram wwappears in the word sequence Wand n W ww denotes the number of times the bigram wwappears in the word sequence W. EQ. 17 also includes weighting parameters H that directly incorporate the information from the joint association scores D C W X as follows 

As is increased and even approaches infinity the weighting parameters that are associated with the target word sequence Wbut not competitor word sequence Ware increased while those associated with competitor word sequence Wbut not target word sequence Ware decreased. Revisions produced for bigrams common to both the target word sequence Wand the competitor word sequence Wtherefore cancel out and those corresponding language model weighting parameters are left unchanged. Meanwhile the language model parameters corresponding to the bigrams that are present in the target word sequence Wbut not in the competitor word sequence Ware increased. In the example of Table 1 above these bigrams would include the transportation transportation in and in atlanta . On the other hand the language model parameters corresponding to the bigrams that are present in the competitor word sequence Wbut not in the target word sequence Ware decreased. In the example of Table 1 above these bigrams would include the round round trip trip fare fare from and from Atlanta . While the particular example of bigrams are used here analogous effects could be achieved with any other type of language model weighting coefficient including n grams of other n or other lexical features and either one or any number of different type of language model weighting parameters. One or more weighting parameters may therefore be revised to raise the joint association score of the target word sequence with the target semantic class relative to the joint association score of the competitor word sequence with the target semantic class according to the present illustrative embodiment.

Analogous functions may be applied to the semantic classification weighting parameters which may for example correspond to lexical features of the word sequence in this illustrative embodiment. A revised semantic classifier parameter may be provided with reference to an initial or prior iteration semantic classifier parameter according to the equation 

Extending the analogy to the revision of the language model weighting parameters this isolates the partial derivative of the class specific misclassification function d X of EQ. 20 above with respect to the semantic classification weighting parameters which can be resolved as 

Here incorporates semantic model weighting parameters based on the semantic classes Cand word sequences W as follows 

Again in analogy to the language model weighting parameters this enables the semantic classification weighting parameters associated with the target semantic class Cbut not with the competitor semantic class Care increased while those associated with competitor semantic class Cbut not target semantic class Care decreased. Once again therefore one or more weighting parameters may be revised to raise the joint association score of the target word sequence with the target semantic class relative to the joint association score of the competitor word sequence with the target semantic class according to the present illustrative embodiment.

A semantic understanding system may therefore be provided for an application that includes speech recognition and semantic classification systems that have been trained by systems analogous to those described above. Such an application such as a voice user interface for example may be configured to receive a speech input match the speech input to a semantic class and to a word sequence corresponding to the semantic class and provide the semantic classes matched to the speech input to an application configured to provide user output that is dependent on the semantic classes matched to the speech input in an illustrative embodiment. The speech input may be matched to a semantic class and to a corresponding word sequence by applying a semantic classification tool to the speech input wherein the semantic classification rule selects for the highest joint association score between a semantic class and a word sequence for the speech input. The joint association score may include parameters of a language model and parameters of a semantic classification model that have been iteratively trained to reduce a total loss function indicative of a rate of error in semantically classifying speech inputs due to errors in either the language model or the semantic classification model in this illustrative embodiment.

The example of an Airline Travel Information System ATIS was referred to with reference to the training process and is one example of an application in which an embodiment of a trained speech recognizer and semantic classifier may illustratively be embodied. That is only one of many possible examples and any system for voice input and voice user interface among other potential examples may also incorporate various embodiments that may be discerned by those skilled in the art based on the disclosure herein.
