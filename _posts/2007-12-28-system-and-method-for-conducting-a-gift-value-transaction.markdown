The present disclosure relates generally to financial transactions and more particularly to a system and method for conducting a gift value transaction.

In direct face to face or online financial transactions customers search for and purchase products and or services from a merchant. In the case of online shopping transactions are conducted through electronic communications with online merchants over electronic networks such as the Internet. During the course of these transactions customers may provide payment for products and services. In this regard the products and services may be purchased for use by the customer. Alternatively in a gift value transaction the products and services may be purchased by the customer and given as a gift item or a gift card that may be redeemed for products and services from the merchant that issued the gift card.

In one gift value transaction scenario a customer purchases a gift item a shirt for example from a merchant directly or via a merchant s online website. The customer provides information relating to the intended gift recipient such as the person s name and address to the merchant and the gift item shirt is shipped directly or indirectly by the merchant to the intended gift recipient.

In another gift value transaction scenario a customer purchases a gift card from a merchant directly or via a merchant s online website. The gift card or certificate is then presented or mailed to the intended gift recipient. Generally the gift card recipient or gift card holder may apply the value of the gift card to any item product or service offered by the merchant issuing the gift card. If the value of the item purchased with the gift card is greater than the value of the gift card overage the card holder pays the difference. If the value of the item purchased is less than the value of the gift card underage the amount remaining on the gift card may generally be applied to another item s from the same merchant.

However as is often the case the gift recipient may be given a gift item that does not fit or that the gift recipient does not want for one reason or another. Absent the option of keeping the ill fitting or unwanted gift item the gift recipient must return the gift item to the online merchant to receive a substitute gift item i.e. a shirt of the appropriate size or a different gift item. However returning a gift item for exchange or substitution to a merchant is among other things often difficult inconvenient and time consuming. For online transactions additional shipping costs mean that gift returns incur a higher expense for either the merchant or the gift recipient.

Likewise a gift card recipient may be in possession of a merchant s gift card whose products or services are unwanted by the gift recipient. However since the gift card was purchased through a particular merchant if the gift card is to be redeemed the gift card recipient is limited to redeeming the gift card with that particular merchant.

Accordingly there exists a need for an improved system and method for conducting a gift value transaction.

For purposes of summarizing the disclosure exemplary embodiments of a system and method for conducting a gift value transaction have been described herein.

In one embodiment a system for conducting a gift value transaction comprises a communication interface a payment provider system configured receive via the communication interface payment for a gift notify a gift recipient of the gift and prompt the gift recipient to accept or reject the gift and receive a response from the gift recipient. If the response is to accept the gift the gift is released to the gift recipient and if the response is to reject the gift prompt the gift recipient to select an alternative gift.

In another embodiment a network payment provider system includes a holding account. The payment provider system is configured to receive a gift purchase request for one or more gifts having one or more assigned attributes that designate one or more items and one or more merchants for use in acquiring the one or more gifts process the gift purchase request deposit funds for the purchase of the one or more gifts into the holding account and distribute the funds upon acceptance of the gift and identification of a merchant for use of the gift.

In still another embodiment a method of processing a gift purchase comprises receiving a request for payment for a gift notifying a gift recipient of the gift prompting the gift recipient to accept or reject the gift and receiving a response from the gift recipient wherein if the response is to accept the gift the gift is released to the gift recipient and if the response is to reject the gift prompting the gift recipient to select an alternative gift in place of the gift.

These and other embodiments will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art form the following detailed description of the various embodiments having reference to the attached figures the invention not being limited to any particular preferred embodiment s disclosed.

Embodiments of the invention are understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the invention and not for purposes of limiting the same.

Exemplary embodiments will now be described with references to the accompanying figures wherein like reference numbers refer to like elements throughout. The terminology used in the description presented herein is not intended to be interpreted in any limited or restrictive manner simply because it is being utilized in conjunction with a detailed description of certain embodiments.

Embodiments of the present disclosure overcome the often difficult inconvenient time consuming and limiting nature of gift value transactions including the use of a gift card and or the return and exchange of a gift item.

Embodiments of a gift value transaction are described herein as it may relate to an electronic payment system environment. An electronic payment system is generally considered as any kind of network service that includes the exchange of money for goods or services. Such network payment system includes for example a credit and or debit card processing system. For convenience simplicity and efficiency the present disclosure is described relative to and online or web based gift value transaction. However persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the teachings of the present disclosure apply equally to a gift value transaction that occurs directly between a buyer and a merchant such as in a face to face transaction that may occur in department store or similar type business environment.

In one embodiment the network may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example in various embodiments the network may include the Internet and one or more intranets landline networks wireless networks and or other appropriate types of communication networks. In another example the network may comprise a wireless telecommunications network e.g. cellular phone network adapted to communicate with other communication networks such as the Internet.

As used herein a gift generally refers to a gift item and or a gift card . A gift item as used herein is generally considered to include a product and or service while a gift card or a gift certificate as used herein is generally considered a gift instrument that may be used as payment for a product and or service.

As disclosed herein unless otherwise noted the term purchase relates to an amount to be debited from a user s or client s gift purchaser s account relative to the gift value transaction as in a gift purchase request for a gift item and or gift card. In this regard a purchase is linked to an amount designated for a gift item or gift card and is not necessarily associated with any single tangible product and or service as the eventual product and or service received by the intended gift recipient may not be determined until after the purchase of the gift by the user and acceptance of the gift and identification of a merchant by the intended gift recipient.

In one known scheme as generally shown in a gift value transaction includes a client system one or more merchant servers each having a merchant provided website for the sale of products and or services a payment provider and a recipient system available along a network .

Persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that any identification and reference to a client device and its associated user gift purchaser and any identification and reference to a recipient system and its associated user intended gift recipient in any particular embodiment described herein has been done so for convenience and ease of explaining the subject matter disclosed and that the gift purchaser in one embodiment may be the intended gift recipient in another embodiment. Accordingly network connectivity hardware software and activities associated with various gift value transaction embodiments described below as relating to the client system gift purchaser or the recipient system intended gift recipient is understood to similarly relate to the other device.

In one embodiment the client system may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and or software configured for wired and or wireless communication over the network . For example the client system may be implemented as a personal computer of a user e.g. a purchaser a client a buyer a customer in communication with the network such as the Internet. In other examples the client system may be implemented as a wireless telephone e.g. cell phone personal digital assistant PDA notebook computer and or various other generally known types of computing devices.

In one embodiment the client system may include one or more browser applications which may be used for example to provide a user interface to permit the user to browse information available over the network one or more toolbar applications displaying a graphical user interface GUI in connection with the browser application to provide client side processing for performing tasks in response to operations selected by the user and a service application comprising a software program for facilitating financial transactions e.g. the direct purchase of gift items products and or services and or gift cards representing a monetary value for use in acquiring product and or services on the network .

The service application typically comprises a software program such as the GUI executable by a processor that is configured to interface and communicate with the one or more merchant servers and the payment provider via the network . The service application is configured to provide and display a payment mechanism such an image or icon on a display component e.g. monitor of the client system . The user is able to access merchant websites via merchant servers to view and select items for gift purchase by communicating with the payment provider .

The client system may include other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide additional features available to the user . For example such other applications may include security applications for implementing client side security features programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces APIs over the network or various other types of generally known programs and or applications.

The client system may include one or more user identifiers which may be implemented for example as operating system registry entries cookies associated with the browser application identifiers associated with hardware of the client system or various other appropriate identifiers. The user identifier may include attributes related to the user such as personal information and banking information. In various implementations the user identifier may be passed with a user gift purchase request to the payment provider and the user identifier may be used by the payment provider to associate the user with a particular user account maintained by the payment provider .

As shown in one or more merchant servers are maintained by merchants offering various gifts such as products and or services in exchange for financial payment or other consideration to be received from users such as user over the network . In this regard each one of the one or more merchant servers may include a database for identifying available products and or services which may be made available to the client system for viewing and gift purchase by the user . Accordingly each of the merchant servers may include a marketplace application configured to provide information over the network to the browser application of the client system . For example the user may interact with the marketplace application through the browser application over the network to search and view various items products and or services identified in the database .

Each of the one or more merchant servers may include a checkout application configured to accept payment information from the user and or from the payment provider over the network to facilitate online gift value transactions of products and or services identified by the marketplace application .

Each of the one or more merchant servers may include one or more merchant identifiers which may be included as part of the one or more gifts made available for purchase so that a particular gift may be associated with a particular merchant . The merchant identifier may include attributes related to the merchant such as business and banking information. In various implementations the merchant identifier may be passed with a user s gift purchase request to the payment provider when the user selects a gift for purchase and processing and the merchant identifier may be used by the payment provider to associate a particular gift purchased with a particular merchant account maintained by the payment provider .

Each of the one or more merchants having a related merchant server may need to establish a merchant account with the payment provider so that the payment provider is able to process transactions having items offered for gift purchase by the merchants . When establishing a merchant account each of the one or more merchants may need to provide business information such as name address phone number etc. and financial information such as banking information merchant account information credit card information payment processing information etc.

Each of the one or more merchant servers may be associated with a particular link e.g. a link such as a URL Uniform Resource Locator to an IP Internet Protocol address . In this regard the payment provider may optionally redirect the browser application to an appropriate webpage and or merchant site of the merchant server to facilitate purchase of a corresponding gift made available from at least one of the merchant servers .

The payment provider may be maintained for example by an online payment provider which may provide payment processing for online transactions on behalf of the user to an operator of the merchant server . In this regard the payment provider includes one or more payment applications which may be configured to interact with the client device and or each of the merchant servers over the network to facilitate the purchase of gifts by the user from the merchant server .

The payment provider may be configured to maintain a plurality of user and merchant accounts each of which may include account information associated with individual users including the user and the one or more merchants associated with the merchant servers . For example account information may include private financial information of user and merchants such as one or more account numbers passwords credit card information banking information or other types of financial information which may be used to facilitate online transactions between the user of the client system and one or more merchants associated with the merchant servers . As such the payment application may be configured to interact with the one or more merchant servers on behalf of the user during a transaction with checkout application without requiring the user to provide account information directly to the merchant server . In various embodiments the methods and systems described herein may be modified to accommodate users and or merchants that may or may not be associated with at least one existing user account and or merchant account respectively.

As shown in in one method for conducting a client side online gift value transaction the service application may be installed and run on the client system to allow the client system to communicate with one or more of the merchant servers via the network to select a gift such as a gift item and or a gift card for purchase.

In this regard the client may purchase a particular gift item a blender for example from the merchant s site . The merchant may notify the intended gift recipient for example via email of the completed gift purchase and intended delivery of the blender by a well known delivery method to the intended gift recipient at the address provided by the client .

Alternatively in lieu of a gift item the client may purchase a gift card from the merchant s site . Typically the gift card will have a designated monetary value that may be used by the gift recipient at the merchant s website or store toward the purchase of one or more products and or services. Typically once the gift card is purchased the intended gift card recipient is notified by email via the network that a gift card has been made available. The gift card recipient may than access the merchant s site and use the gift card or the gift card may be downloaded onto the recipient system printed and used at the merchant s store.

Likewise the service application allows the client system to further communicate with the payment provider to process online gift purchase requests for gifts selected for purchase and processing in a gift value transaction.

As indicated above the user may run the browser application on the client system to access at least one merchant website via a related merchant server to search the accessed merchant website and view one or more gifts for purchase.

The user may for example generate a gift purchase request for a gift item and or a gift card by selecting a gift value icon at the merchant s site . The selection and payment processing of the gift purchase request for a gift card and or gift item is generally similar to the selection and payment process for any other item product or service intended for personal use from the merchant s site .

In this regard the payment provider receives a gift purchase request from the user via the client system . As previously discussed the user may initiate a user gift purchase request by dragging and dropping an gift icon of a selected gift over the gift value icon which initiates the user purchase request and online gift value transaction with the payment provider .

Next upon receiving the user gift purchase request the payment provider verifies the user account information including user identification provider by user in the user s gift purchase request. For example the user may be prompted by the payment provider to provide user identification or at least verify the user identification for a related user account stored in payment provider so that funds may be deducted from the user account for purchase of the gift item and or gift card . Once proper user identification is provided and or verified the online gift purchase may be completed.

In this regard the gift purchase request may include user information merchant information and selected gift item and or gift card information embedded as arguments in an expression that are passed to the payment provider . The user information may include user identifier information the merchant information may include the merchant identifier information and the selected gift card information may include one or more image attributes including gift identifier information having dynamic arguments identifying the gift and merchant providing the gift item and or card .

Next the payment provider may prompt the user via for example a pop up window to verify the gift purchase request. For example the payment provider may ask the user to select a designated box to complete the gift purchase. Next the payment provider completes the online gift transaction by deducting the amount of the purchase request from the user account and crediting the amount of the purchase request to the merchant account .

The payment provider will generally provide notification and delivery of the gift item and or the gift card to the intended recipient in a manner similarly used by the merchant e.g. email delivery service etc. The gift item is then obtained by the intended gift recipient while the gift card may be redeemed for some tangible product or service offered by the merchant .

It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that more than one gift item and or gift card may be selected prior to completing the online gift purchase. For example a plurality of gift items and or gift cards may be selected and placed in a virtual shopping cart and then purchased in a single online transaction. Alternately each gift item and or gift card selected for purchase may be purchased separately without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

As indicated above the gift recipient may be given a gift item that does not fit or that the gift recipient does not want for one reason or another. Likewise a gift recipient may be in possession of a merchant s gift card whose products or services are unwanted by the gift recipient . As such as is often the case in the gift transactions shown in and explained above the gift recipient may never use the gift card is limited in use of the gift card or the gift recipient must endure the difficult inconvenient and time consuming task of returning a gift item for exchange or substitution to a merchant .

Accordingly the present disclosure addresses among other things the problems of having to accept or receive a merchant specific gift item and or gift card gift by providing a system and method for conducting a gift purchase and gift value transaction that allows the gift purchaser to assign various gift attributes and the intended gift recipient to accept or reject the gift having those attributes or if no attributes have been assigned to use the gift in an unrestricted manner.

Accordingly for simplicity applications including browser toolbar service marketplace and payment to name a few associated with one or more of the networked devices as well as other device and or system functionality either explicitly or implicitly disclosed to facilitate network connectivity and communication relative to the networked devices of may or may not be discussed or identified below but are understood to apply to the system and method for conducting a gift value transaction shown in .

In one implementation the user may run the browser application on the client system to access at least one merchant website via a related merchant server to search the accessed merchant website and view one or more products and or services available for gift purchase. As discussed in more detail below the user may select a gift item product and or service a gift card representing a monetary value that may be redeemed toward the acquisition of a product and or service as well as assign various gift attributes to the gift item and or gift card. In this regard selection of a gift card is shown in however it will be understood that the selection processing assigning of various attributes by the user and acceptance or rejection of a gift by the intended gift recipient applies equally to a gift item .

As discussed above the service application allows the client system to communicate with one or more of the merchant servers and further communicate with the payment provider to process online gift purchases of selected gifts. In one embodiment the user may generate a gift purchase request for a least one gift item or gift card by selecting dragging and dropping the at least one gift item or gift card over the appropriate gift value icon using a cursor control component e.g. a mouse . Persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that other methods of gift selection may apply for example the user may select a box during checkout which indicates that the gift item should not be shipped but held for pre exchange as described below.

The user gift purchase request may included user information merchant information and selected gift service information embedded as arguments in a expression that are passed on to the payment provider to enable payment processing of the user s gift purchase request by the payment provider . The user information may include user identifier information the merchant information may include merchant identifier information and the selected gift information may include one or more image attributes including gift identifier information having dynamic arguments identifying the gift and merchant providing the gift for purchase.

In this regard in one embodiment user information including user identifier information merchant information including merchant identifier information and other information related to the gift purchase such as identifiers for the primary gift and the secondary gift s as well as identifiers for the purchaser and recipient email addresses may be used to map or otherwise track purchasers with gifts purchased and further with intended gift recipients.

Such mapping between the purchaser gifts purchased and gift recipients would permit the payment provider system to keep track of the various restricted balances between gift recipients and merchants. For example gift transaction mapping would permit the payment provider system to maintain account balances indicated that an account holder has a gift balance of a certain amount with a particular merchant. In addition gift transaction mapping would further permit the payment provider system to maintain records of assigned gift attributes and category attributes as applied to various gifts and the corresponding gift recipients.

In one example the user may select a gift purchase request for the purchase of a gift card having a designated monetary value for use by an intended gift recipient in acquiring a product and or service from a merchant.

The payment provider processes the purchase information provided by the user s gift purchase request and completes the online gift purchase by deducting the designated gift card amount from the user s account . In one example completing the gift purchase request may include a confirmation from the payment provider or redirecting the user to a page on the merchant site that confirms their purchase of the selected gift and provides a receipt to the user .

As explained below a gift purchase request of the gift value transaction system and method shown in may include gift attributes having at least merchant level and or category level attributes selected by the user from a pull down menu provided in a comments box or otherwise communicated and included in the user information and or selected gift information passed on to the payment provider . As such in contrast to the gift value transaction system and method shown in in one embodiment the merchant is not credited the designated gift card amount until the intended gift recipient accepts the gift and identifies a merchant for gift use or redeems the gift card with a merchant.

The ability to accept or reject a gift card gives the intended gift card recipient greater flexibility and choice in acquiring and using a gift card to obtain products and or services. Likewise the ability to assign various attributes to a gift card gives the gift card purchaser greater flexibility and choice in providing products and or services.

Merchant level attributes may restrict or allow use of the gift card by the intended gift card recipient to a particular merchant or group of merchants. For example in the online gift value transaction system and method shown in the user may designate that gift card A is intended for use at merchant site A . In this regard merchant site A would be considered the primary merchant site assigned to gift card A .

However in the event that merchant site A does not have a product and or service that the intended gift recipient may want to acquire the user may permit the intended gift recipient to utilize gift card A at merchant site B and or at merchant site C . In this regard merchant site B and merchant site C would be considered alternative merchants site assigned to gift card A .

Alternatively the user may indicate that in the event that merchant site A does not have a product and or service that the intended gift recipient may want to acquire the intended gift recipient may utilize the gift card at any merchant site except merchant sites D E and F .

Accordingly gift card attributes assigned by the user may take the form of a merchant restriction attribute i.e. identifies one or more merchant sites where the gift card can not be used or a merchant access attribute i.e. identifies one or more merchant sites where the gift card can be used . Of course the user may place a merchant specific attribute to gift card A such that gift card A can only be used at merchant site A and no other merchant site. On the other hand gift card A may be purchased having no assigned gift card attributes. As such the gift recipient would be able to utilize gift card A at any available or participating merchant site A B C D E and or F .

Similarly a product and or service for example a blender may be designated as a gift item for an intended gift recipient . The user may designate that the intended gift item is associated with merchant site A . However the user may assign merchant restriction attributes and or merchant access attributes such that the intended gift recipient may if so desired reject the intended gift item blender associated with merchant site A and acquire a blender or other product and or service as explained in regard to category level attributes from other merchants as indicated by the merchant level attributes assigned by the user .

Category level attributes may restrict or allow the intended gift recipient to use the gift card to acquire one or more product and or service within a particular category type group theme etc. of products and or services. Categories may include but are not limited to those related or associated with entertainment sporting goods kitchen appliances youth education apparel home and auto repair etc. For example in the online gift value transaction system and method shown in the user may designate that gift card A is intended for use in acquiring a product and or service for entertainment. More specifically an assigned gift card attribute may indicate that gift card A may be redeemed for movie or performing art tickets. In this regard a category level attribute may be as broad or as narrowly defined as the gift card purchaser desires.

Likewise the user may assign category level attributes that prohibit or allow access to a category of products and or services for acquisition with gift card A . For example the user may assign a category level attribute that prohibits gift card A from being used to acquire tobacco and alcohol products however gift card A may be used to acquire all other products and or services.

Similarly the user may assign category level attributes to a gift item. For example the user may designate a blender as a gift item for an intended gift recipient . In this regard the blender would be considered the primary gift assigned to gift card A . However the user may assign category level attributes that correspond to alternative gifts such that the intended gift recipient may if so desired reject the intended primary gift item blender and acquire alternative or secondary products and or services other than the blender from merchant site A or other merchant sites as indicated by the merchant level attributes assigned by the user and explained above.

Once a primary or an alternative gift is accepted by the intended gift recipient the gift recipient may designate extras such as a camera case or additional memory or colored lens caps that may be added to the gift. These extras may be purchased directly by the gift recipient.

As will be understood by those skilled in the art the gift purchaser may combine merchant level attributes and category level attributes to better define the gift exchange or use parameters. For example gift card A may be assigned merchant level attributes and category level attributes that permit the intended gift card recipient to redeem gift card A with merchants A B and C for kitchen appliance and or lawn care products and or services. Alternatively gift card A may be assigned merchant level and category level attributes that prohibit gift card A from being used with merchants D E and F and for tobacco related products and or services. In another embodiment gift card A may be redeemable only with merchant A and only within one or more specific categories. Another example would include a gift card that is valid across a number of child friendly sites but that cannot be redeemed for video games that have a high violence rating.

As further shown in the gift recipient may receive one or more separate gift cards which may in one embodiment be aggregated for use as a combined gift card . In this way gift values are pooled to potentially increase gift choice to the gift recipient . Such a combined gift card may be subjected to the combined merchant level attributes and category level attributes assigned to the one or more separate gift cards . For example a gift recipient might exchange several gift cards or gift items for a single large purchase such as a furniture set.

As indicated above after purchase of the gift by the gift purchaser the payment provider processes the purchase information provided by the user s gift purchase request and completes the online gift purchase by deducting the gift purchase amount from the user s account . The gift having assigned merchant and or category level attributes is then made available for acceptance by the intended gift card recipient .

In this regard because the gift may include assigned merchant level and category level attributes the gift in one scenario may be redeemed or acquired from any one of a number of merchants. Accordingly credit of a merchant s account and completion of the gift value transaction may not occur until the gift is accepted and identified for use with a particular merchant or redeemed by the intended gift recipient . As such funds deducted from the user s account are deposited in an intermediary holding account by the payment service provider until queued for distribution to the merchant s account upon acceptance of the gift card and identification of the merchant or the gift card being redeemed by the gift recipient . In another embodiment funds deducted from the user s account are held by the intended merchant.

To make sure the intended gift recipient receives the gift and perhaps more importantly to avoid issues of escheatment and settling of outstanding accounts in one embodiment the gift recipient is given a predetermined time in which to accept the gift and identify a merchant for use of the received gift. In this regard if the gift is not accepted within the predetermined time limit a default acceptance and identification protocol prescribed by the user or payment service may be utilized.

Any overage or underage encountered in completing a gift value transaction may generally be handled as previously discussed. That is if the value of the item purchased is greater than the value of the gift overage the gift holder may be requested to pay the difference. Alternatively in an overage the user may agree to be charged the excess gift value amount up to some maximum predetermined limit. If the value of the item purchased is less than the value of the gift underage the amount remaining may generally be applied to another item s . Alternatively the underage may be credited back to the gift purchaser given to the gift recipient as cash given to a charity given to the merchant given as a gift to someone else held by the merchant or payment service until escheated to a governing body held by the merchant or payment service until maintenance fees decrement the remaining balance to zero or held by the merchant or payment service indefinitely. Where the price of a gift item changes prior to redeeming or using the gift by the gift recipient such situations may be viewed and handled as would any other overage or underage situation.

In one implementation upon user instruction the service application may be installed and or run on the client system block . The user may run the browser application on the client system to access at least one merchant website via a related merchant server block to search and view one or more gifts gift item and or gift card for products and or services for purchase block . In one embodiment upon installation the user may be prompted to establish a user account with the payment provider wherein the user may use the client system to access the payment provider via the network . When establishing a user account the user may be asked to provide personal information such as name address phone number etc. and financial information such as banking information credit card information etc. In one embodiment information related to the user may be packaged as the user identifier .

Next the user may generate a gift purchase request for at least one gift by selecting the at least one gift block assigning one or more merchant level attributes block and or assigning one or more category level attributes block and communicating the gift purchase request to the payment provider system block .

The one or more merchant level attributes may allow and or restrict the intended gift recipient from using the gift card or acquiring an alternative gift item from selected merchants. Likewise the one or more category level attributes may allow and or restrict the intended gift recipient from using the gift card or acquiring an alternative gift item for selected products and or services.

In one embodiment the user s gift purchase request may include user information merchant information including merchant level attributes and selected gift information included category level attribute that are passed on to the payment provider . When enabled the payment mechanism may transmit the gift purchase request to the payment provider for payment processing.

Once the user selects a gift the user may be prompted to provide user identification block and verify the user identification for a related user account stored in the payment provider so that funds may be deducted from the user account for purchase of the gift. However it should be appreciated that the user identification may be provided and passed on with the user s gift purchase request .

As indicated above these funds may be held in an intermediary holding account until acceptance of the gift by the gift recipient . Once proper user identification is provided and or verified for example by acceptance of the gift item the online gift purchase may be completed block .

As further shown by item connector 3 shown in the user may upon rejection of the gift by the intended gift recipient search and view alternative gifts for purchase that may be presented once again to the intended gift recipient shows one embodiment of a method for facilitating an online gift value transaction in reference to the payment provider .

In one embodiment the payment provider receives a gift purchase request from the user via the client system block . As previously discussed with reference to to initiate a user online gift purchase request with the payment provider the user may drag and drop a selected gift for purchase over the gift value icon.

Upon receiving the user s gift purchase request the payment provider determines whether the user is an existing user having an established user account by for example checking a user account list in a user account database. If the user does not have an established user account block then the payment provider prompts the user to establish a user account by providing user information block and the payment provider uploads the service application to the client system so that the user may install and run the service application on client system block . Once the service application is installed and run on the client system the payment provider processes the gift purchase information provided in the user s gift purchase request block .

Otherwise if the user is determined to be an existing user by the payment provider block then the payment provider verifies the user account and user identification information provided by the user in the user s gift purchase request block . For example as previously discussed the user may be prompted to provide user identification to purchase any selected gift and complete the online purchase transaction.

Next the payment provider may determine if the user account is current and active block . In some instances a user s account information may need to be updated and thus the payment provider may prompt the user to update user account information in the user account block . If the user account is current and active then the payment provider processes the purchase information in the user s purchase request block . It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the payment provider may cancel the online gift purchase or gift value transaction at any point in the process if it is determined that the user enters wrong information or the user is trying to purchase a gift with malicious intent.

The payment provider processes the purchase information provided in the user s gift purchase request block . The purchase information may include information related to the gift selected for purchase information related to the merchant providing the gift selected for purchase information related to the user including user account number balance information credit card information etc. In one implementation the payment provider server may optionally access the merchant site via the merchant server to verify purchase information including verifying that the selected gift is available e.g. in stock verifying the pricing information verifying that the merchant account is up to date etc. block . Next the payment provider may prompt the user via for example a pop up window to verify the purchase request block . For example the payment provider may ask the user to complete the gift purchase transaction by selecting a designated box to complete the purchase transaction. In this way the payment provider is adapted to allow the user to cancel the online gift purchase prior to completion of the transaction.

Next the payment provider completes the online gift purchase by deducting funds i.e. the amount of the purchase request from the user account block . As explained above funds are deposited into an intermediary holding account block and the online gift value transaction is completed by crediting the amount of the purchase request to the merchant account block upon gift acceptance and identification of the merchant by the gift recipient . As contact information of the user i.e. gift purchaser is maintained by the payment provider system completing the online value gift transaction may further prompt an acknowledgement and or a gift acceptance courtesy or gratitude offering such as a thank you email message from the gift recipient directed to the user gift purchaser .

In one embodiment completing the gift purchase request may include redirecting the user to a page on the merchant site that confirms their purchase of the selected gift to provide for example a receipt to the user . The payment mechanism may also take different actions such as adding the gift to a virtual shopping cart and providing buttons to complete the gift purchase at a later time.

In one embodiment upon receipt of the gift offer block the user may accept or rejected the gift offer. In this regard as the gift offer may include a primary gift offering as well as one or more alternative gifts the gift recipient may accept the primary gift block or any alternative gift block as prescribed by the gift attributes assigned to the gift. If acceptance of the primary or alternative gift occurs gift extras may be added by the intended gift recipient blocks and typically for a nominal charge by designating the desired gift extras as described above blocks and . Once a gift primary or alternative is accepted and if desired gift extras added the gift card is then redeemed block or the gift item is then acquired block . In the event the gift recipient rejects the one or more gift offerings designated by the assigned gift attributes the gift purchaser is notified of the gift rejection block and may if desired search and view further alternative gifts for purchase that may be presented once again to the intended gift recipient .

In an alternative embodiment the subject matter described herein may apply equally to the purchase of subscriptions for items such as magazines newspapers and similar periodic digests having reoccurring distribution. For example a parent may purchase a magazine subscription for their child. The child would then be permitted to exchange to the purchased magazine subscription for a different magazine subscription a newspaper subscription or possibly a book of the month club video or gaming membership. In this regard the purchaser is generally committing to an ongoing payment or at least until the initial subscription expires while the subscription recipient may choose to exchange the subscription with a different subscription at some point during the purchased subscription period. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand the principles described herein may be applied to perpetual gifts as well as limited subscription gifts.
