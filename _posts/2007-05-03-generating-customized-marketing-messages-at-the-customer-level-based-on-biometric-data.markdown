This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 695 983 filed Apr. 3 2007 titled Method and Apparatus for Providing Customized Digital Media Marketing Content Directly to a Customer which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention is also related to the following applications entitled Retail Store Method and System Robyn Schwartz Publication No. US 2006 0032915 A1 filed Aug. 12 2004 and Business Offering Content Delivery Robyn R. Levine Publication No. US 2002 0111852 filed Jan. 16 2001 all assigned to a common assignee and all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention is related generally to an improved data processing system and in particular to a method and apparatus for processing data. More particularly the present invention is directed to a computer implemented method apparatus and computer usable program code for dynamically generating customized marketing messages for a customer using biometric data associated with the customer.

In the past merchants such as store owners and operators frequently had a personal relationship with their customers. The merchant often knew their customers names address marital status and ages of their children hobbies place of employment anniversaries birthdays likes dislikes and personal preferences. The merchant was able to use this information to cater to customer needs and push sales of items the customer might be likely to purchase based on the customer s personal situation. However with the continued growth of large cities the corresponding disappearance of small rural towns and the increasing number of large impersonal chain stores with multiple employees the merchants and employees of retail businesses rarely recognize regular customers and almost never know the customer s name or any other details regarding their customer s personal preferences that might assist the merchant or employee in marketing efforts directed toward a particular customer.

One solution to this problem is directed toward using profile data for a customer to generate personalized marketing messages that may be sent to the customer by email print media telephone or over the World Wide Web via a web page for the merchant. Customer profile data typically includes information provided by the customer in response to a questionnaire or survey such as name address telephone number gender and indicators of particular products the customer is interested in purchasing. Demographic data regarding a customer s age sex income career interests hobbies and consumer preferences may also be included in customer profile data.

In an ideal situation an advertising computer then generates a customer advertisement based on the customer s profile. For example one version of an advertisement may be directed to selling fruit juice to children while another version of the advertisement may be directed to selling the same fruit juice to adults. However this method only provides a small number of pre generated advertisements that are directed towards a fairly large segment of the population rather than to one individual. In other words the same advertisement for selling the fruit juice to an adult may be provided to a soccer mom and to a college student despite the fact that the soccer mom and college student have very different tastes attitudes preferences financial constraints and or goals.

In another solution user profile data demographic data point of contact data and transaction data are analyzed to generate advertising content for customers that target the information content presented to individual consumers or users to increase the likelihood that the customer will purchase the goods or services presented. However current solutions do not utilize all of the potential dynamic customer data elements that may be available to a retail owner or operator for generating customized marketing messages targeted to individual customers. For example a person might be recently unemployed or have had a recent lifestyle change due to divorce or perhaps a death in the family. In addition during the shopping experience the customer may be calm and relaxed or agitated and upset. The customer s mood and current situation may influence the customer s receptivity to advertising messages.

Other data pieces may also be needed to provide effective dynamic one to one marketing messages to the potential customer. Therefore the data elements in prior art only provides approximately seventy five percent 75 of the needed data to effectively customize advertising to one or more customers.

The illustrative embodiments provide a computer implemented method apparatus and computer usable program code for customizing marketing messages using biometric data. In one embodiment data is received from a set of biometric devices associated with a retail facility to form the biometric data. The biometric data may be data regarding a customer s status state or data regarding a customer s physiological responses.

In one embodiment the biometric data is obtained by detecting a change in a biometric reading associated with the customer that exceeds a threshold change and associating the change in the biometric reading with the item or the marketing message to form the biometric data if the customer was viewing an item or a marketing message when the change in the biometric reading occurred. A biometric reading may be a measurement of a customer s vital statistics over a given period of time a measurement of a change in voice stress for the customer s voice or a measurement of a change in a dilation of the customer s pupil. A customer s vital statistics includes at least one of a customer s heart rate respiratory rate and blood pressure.

The biometric data is associated with a given customer. The biometric data is processed to form dynamic data. The dynamic data is analyzed using a data model to identify personalized marketing message criteria for the customer. The dynamic data may be analyzed in a single data model or analyzed serially in a set of data models with the results of analyzing the dynamic data in a first data model being utilized as input for analysis in a next data model in the set of data models.

A customized marketing message is generated using the personalized marketing message criteria. The customized marketing message is delivered to a display device associated with the customer for display to the customer. The customized marketing message is dynamically updated in response to the biometric data associated with the customer.

In one embodiment processing the biometric data to form the dynamic data includes processing the biometric data with any available internal data and or external data. The set of biometric devices associated with the retail facility may include biometric devices located inside the retail facility and or outside the retail facility. In another embodiment biometric data may be used to dynamically identify the customer. In this example the biometric device may be a fingerprint scanner thumbprint scanner palm scanner a retina scanner and or a voice print scanner for obtaining biometric data to identify the customer.

A marketing message may include textual content graphical content moving video content still images audio content and or any combination of textual graphical moving video still images and audio content. A customized marketing message is a marketing message that is generated for a particular customer or group of customers based on one or more personalized message criteria for the customer.

Retail facility is a retail facility for wholly or partially storing enclosing or displaying items for viewing selection order and or purchase. For example retail facility may be without limitation a retail store supermarket book store or shopping mall. However retail facility is not limited to retail stores. For example retail facility may also be without limitation a sports arena amusement park water park or convention center. In this example retail facility is a grocery store.

Detectors are devices for detecting the presence of a customer outside of retail facility but within digital customer marketing environment . These detectors are examples of detectors that are located externally to retail facility . In this example detectors are located at locations along an outer perimeter of digital customer marketing environment . However detectors may be located at any position within digital customer marketing environment that is outside retail facility to detect customers before the customers enter retail facility and or after customers leave digital customer marketing environment .

Detectors may be any type of detecting devices including but not limited to a camera a motion sensor device a sonar sound or audio detection device a voice recognition system a heat sensor a seismograph a pressure sensor a device for detecting odors scents and or fragrances a radio frequency identification RFID tag reader a global positioning system GPS receiver and or any other detection device for detecting a presence of a human animal and or conveyance vehicle outside of the retail facility. A conveyance vehicle is a vehicle for conveying people animals or objects to a destination. A conveyance vehicle may include but is not limited to a car bus truck motorcycle boat airplane or any other type of vehicle.

External customer data may include data gathered by a camera an audio or sound detection device a seismograph pressure sensors a device for detecting odors scents and or fragrances a motion detector a thermal sensor or other heat sensor device and or any other device for detecting a presence of a human animal and or conveyance vehicle outside of the retail facility.

A heat sensor may be any type of known or available sensor for detecting body heat generated by a human or animal. A heat sensor may also be a sensor for detecting heat generated by a vehicle such as an automobile or a motorcycle.

A motion detector may include any type of known or available motion detector device. A motion detector device may include but is not limited to a motion detector device using a photo sensor radar or microwave radio detector or ultrasonic sound waves.

A motion detector using ultrasonic sound waves transmits or emits ultrasonic sounds waves. The motion detector detects or measures the ultrasonic sound waves that are reflected back to the motion detector. If a human animal or other object moves within the range of the ultrasonic sound waves generated by the motion detector the motion detector detects a change in the echo of sound waves reflected back. This change in the echo indicates the presence of a human animal or other object moving within the range of the motion detector.

In one example a motion detector device using a radar or microwave radio detector may detect motion by sending out a burst of microwave radio energy and detecting the same microwave radio waves when the radio waves are deflected back to the motion detector. If a human animal or other object moves into the range of the microwave radio energy field generated by the motion detector the amount of energy reflected back to the motion detector is changed. The motion detector identifies this change in reflected energy as an indication of the presence of a human animal or other object moving within the motion detectors range.

A motion detector device using a photo sensor detects motion by sending a beam of light across a space into a photo sensor. The photo sensor detects when a human animal or object breaks or interrupts the beam of light as the human animal or object by moving in between the source of the beam of light and the photo sensor. These examples of motion detectors are presented for illustrative purposes only. A motion detector in accordance with the illustrative embodiments may include any type of known or available motion detector and is not limited to the motion detectors described herein.

A pressure sensor detector may be for example a device for detecting a change in weight or mass associated with the pressure sensor. For example if one or more pressure sensors are imbedded in a sidewalk Astroturf or floor mat the pressure sensor detects a change in weight or mass when a human customer or animal steps on the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor may also detect when a human customer or animal steps off of the pressure sensor. In another example one or more pressure sensors are embedded in a parking lot and the pressure sensors detect a weight and or mass associated with a vehicle when the vehicle is in contact with the pressure sensor. A vehicle may be in contact with one or more pressure sensors when the vehicle is driving over one or more pressure sensors and or when a vehicle is parked on top of one or more pressure sensors.

A camera may be any type of known or available camera including but not limited to a video camera for taking moving video images a digital camera capable of taking still pictures and or a continuous video stream a stereo camera a web camera and or any other imaging device capable of capturing a view of whatever appears within the camera s range for remote monitoring viewing or recording of a distant or obscured person object or area.

Various lenses filters and other optical devices such as zoom lenses wide angle lenses mirrors prisms and the like may also be used with image capture device to assist in capturing the desired view. Device may be fixed in a particular orientation and configuration or it may along with any optical devices be programmable in orientation light sensitivity level focus or other parameters. Programming data may be provided via a computing device such as server in .

A camera may also be a stationary camera and or non stationary cameras. A non stationary camera is a camera that is capable of moving and or rotating along one or more directions such as up down left right and or rotate about an axis of rotation. The camera may also be capable of moving to follow or track a person animal or object in motion. In other words the camera may be capable of moving about an axis of rotation in order to keep a customer animal or object within a viewing range of the camera lens. In this example detectors are non stationary digital video cameras.

Detectors are connected to an analysis server on a data processing system such as network data processing system in . The analysis server is illustrated and described in greater detail in below.

The data processing system includes the analysis server for analyzing dynamic external customer data obtained from detectors and set of detectors as well as internal customer data obtained from one or more databases storing data associated with one or more customers.

Retail items are items of merchandise for sale. Retail items may be displayed on a display shelf not shown located in retail facility . Other items of merchandise that may be for sale such as food beverages shoes clothing household goods decorative items or sporting goods may be hung from display racks displayed in cabinets on shelves or in refrigeration units not shown . Any other type of merchandise display arrangement known in the retail trade may also be used in accordance with the illustrative embodiments.

For example display shelves or racks may include in addition to retail items various advertising displays images or postings. A multimedia display device attached to a data processing system may also be included. The images shown on the multimedia display may be changed in real time in response to various events such as the time of day the day of the week a particular customer approaching the shelves or rack or items already placed inside container by the customer.

Retail items may be viewed or identified using an image capture device such as a camera or other detector in set of detectors . To facilitate such viewing an item may have attached identification tags . Identification tags are tags associated with one or more retail items for identifying the item and or location of the item. For example identification tags may be without limitation a bar code pattern such as a universal product code UPC or European article number EAN a radio frequency identification RFID tag or other optical identification tag depending on the capabilities of the image capture device and associated data processing system to process the information and make an identification of retail items . In some embodiments an optical identification may be attached to more than one side of a given item.

The data processing system shown in below includes associated memory which may be an integral part such as the operating memory of the data processing system or externally accessible memory. Software for tracking objects may reside in the memory and run on the processor. The software is capable of tracking retail items as a customer removes an item in retail items from its display position and places the item into container . Likewise the tracking software can track items which are being removed from container and placed elsewhere in the retail store whether placed back in their original display position or anywhere else including into another container. The tracking software can also track the position of container and the customer.

The software can track retail items by using data from one or more of detectors located externally to retail facility internal data captured by one or more detectors in set of detectors located internally to retail facility identification data received from identification tags and or identification data received from identification tags .

The software in the data processing system keeps a list of which items have been placed in each shopping container such as container . The list is stored in a database. The database may be any type of database such as a spreadsheet relational database hierarchical database or the like. The database may be stored in the operating memory of the data processing system externally on a secondary data storage device locally on a recordable medium such as a hard drive floppy drive CD ROM DVD device remotely on a storage area network such as storage area network in or in any other type of storage device.

The lists of items in container are updated frequently enough to maintain a dynamic accurate real time listing of the contents of each container as customers add and remove items from containers such as container . The listings of items in containers are also made available to whatever inventory system is used in retail facility . Such listings represent an up to the minute view of which items are still available for sale for example to on line shopping customers. The listings may also provide a demand side trigger back to the supplier of each item. In other words the listing of items in customer shopping containers can be used to update inventories to determine current stock available for sale to customers and or identification of items that need to be restocked or replenished.

At any time the customer using container may request to see a listing of the contents of container by entering a query at a user interface to the data processing system. The user interface may be available at a kiosk computer personal digital assistant or other computing device connected to the data processing system via a network connection. The user interface may also be coupled to a display device such as at a display device in display devices display devices or display device associated with container . The customer may also make such a query after leaving the retail store. For example a query may be made using a portable device or a home computer workstation.

The listing is then displayed at a location where it may be viewed by the customer such as on a display device in display devices inside retail facility display devices outside retail facility or display device associated with container . The listing may include the quantity of each item in container as well as the price for each a discount or amount saved off the regular price of each item and a total price for all items in container . Other data may also be displayed as part of the listing such as additional incentives to purchase one or more other items available in digital customer marketing environment .

In addition the analysis server in the data processing system includes software to monitor for changes in the customer s biometric readings that exceed a threshold or baseline change in biometric readings. The analysis server is capable of analyzing the biometric data to identify a change in biometric data associated with an item in retail items and or a marketing message being viewed when the change in biometric readings occurred. In this manner the analysis server can track a customer s responses to items and marketing messages being viewed by the customer. The customer s responses may indicate whether a customer s reaction is favorable interested disinterested or hostile to the marketing message the item being viewed and or the marketing environment.

When the customer is finished shopping the customer may proceed to a point of sale checkout station. In one embodiment the checkout station may be coupled to the data processing system. Therefore the items in container are already known to the data processing system due to the dynamic listing of items in container that is maintained as the customer shops in digital customer marketing environment . Thus no need is present for an employee customer or other person to scan each item in container to complete the purchase of each item as is commonly done today. In this example the customer merely arranges for payment of the total for example by use of a smart card credit card debit card cash or other payment method. In some embodiments it may not be necessary to empty container at the retail facility at all for example if container is a minimal cost item which can be kept by the customer.

In other embodiments container may belong to the customer. In this example the customer brings container to retail facility at the start of the shopping session. In another embodiment container belongs to retail facility and must be returned before the customer leaves the parking lot or at some other designated time or place.

In another example when the customer is finished shopping the customer may complete checkout either in aisle or from a final or terminal based checkout position in the store using a transactional device which may be integral with container or associated temporarily to container . The customer may also complete the transaction using a consumer owned computing device such as a laptop cellular telephone or personal digital assistant that is connected to the data processing system via a network connection.

The customer may also make payment by swiping a magnetic strip on a card using a radio frequency identification RFID enabled payment device with the transactional device using any biometric type of payment tender via biometric device and or biometric device known in the art and or via any other known or available method for making a payment or concluding a transaction.

The transactional device may also be a portable device such as a laptop computer palm device or any other portable device specially configured for such in aisle checkout service whether integral with container or separately operable. In this example the transactional device connects to the data processing system via a network connection to complete the purchase transaction at checkout time. Checkout may be performed in aisle or at the end of the shopping trip whether from any point or from a specified point of transaction. As noted above checkout transactional devices may be stationary shared devices or portable or mobile devices offered to the customer from the store or may be devices brought to the store by the customer which are compatible with the data processing system and software residing on the data processing system.

Thus in this depicted example when a customer enters digital customer marketing environment but before the customer enters retail facility such as a retail store the customer is detected and identified by one or more detectors in detectors .

After retrieving the internal data in step or if no internal data is available in step the process receives biometric data from a set of biometric devices step . The biometric devices may be located inside the retail facility or outside the retail facility.

The biometric data is processed with any available external data and or internal data associated with the set of customers to form dynamic data step . Processing biometric data internal data and or external data may include filtering the data and or formatting the data to form the dynamic data.

The process pre generates or creates in advance one or more appropriate data models using at least one of a statistical method data mining method causal model mathematical model marketing model behavioral model psychographical model sociological model simulations modeling techniques and or any combination of models data mining statistical methods simulations and or modeling techniques step . The process analyzes the dynamic data using one or more of the appropriate data models to identify a set of personalized marketing message criteria step . The set of personalized marketing message criteria may include one or more criterion for generating a personalized marketing message.

The process dynamically builds a set of one or more customized marketing messages step using the personalized marketing message criteria. The process transmits the set of customized marketing messages to a display device associated with the customer step for presentation of the marketing message to the customer with the process terminating thereafter. Displaying the customized marketing message to the set of customers may include displaying the customized marketing message on an electronic display as an video and or audio message displaying the customized marketing message as a static digital message emailing or text messaging the customized marketing message printing the customized marketing message on a paper medium and or playing the customized marketing message as an audio only message.

In this example any internal data is combined with any external data and the biometric data to form the dynamic data that is analyzed by one or more data models. However in another embodiment any internal data is only combined with biometric data and the internal data is not combined with any external data. Likewise in another embodiment any external data is only combined with biometric data.

Turning now to a flowchart illustrating a process for monitoring for a change in biometric readings associated with a customer is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The process may be implemented by a device for measuring physiological responses and or traits of a customer such as biometric device in and or biometric device in .

The process begins by monitoring biometric readings of a customer obtained from a set of one or more biometric devices step . The process makes a determination as to whether a change in the biometric readings that exceeds a threshold change has been detected step . If a change exceeding the threshold is not detected the process terminates thereafter.

Returning to step if a change exceeding the threshold is detected the process makes a determination as to whether the customer was viewing an item a marketing message or some other identifiable person place or thing when the change in biometric readings occurred step . If the customer was not viewing an item a marketing message or some other identifiable person place or thing the process terminates thereafter.

Returning to step if the customer was viewing an item marketing message or something else identifiable the process associates the change in biometric reading with the item the marketing message or the identifiable person place or thing to form the biometric data step . The process transmits the biometric data to an analysis server and or stores the biometric data in a data storage device for later use in generating customized marketing messages in the future step with the process terminating thereafter.

Thus the illustrative embodiments provide a computer implemented method apparatus and computer usable program code for customizing marketing messages using biometric data. In one embodiment data is received from a set of biometric devices associated with a retail facility to form the biometric data. The biometric data is associated with a given customer. The biometric data is processed to form dynamic data. The dynamic data is analyzed using a data model to identify personalized marketing message criteria for the customer. A customized marketing message is generated using the personalized marketing message criteria.

The illustrative embodiments provide a safe productive and risk free retail environment where good customers can continue to experience maximum price benefits. The illustrative embodiments allow merchants to encourage impulse shopping and manage market basket revenue.

Biometric data may be used to determine if a user is interested or disinterested in an item or advertisement based on changes in biometric data that exceeds a threshold or baseline change. For example a change in heart rate or pupil dilation may indicate an interest or desire in a particular product. Also data such as voice stress may be used to determine if a customer is receptive to advertising at the current moment if the customer is stressed tired or relaxed. This data may be used to customize marketing messages in real time based on the customer s current mood and responses to the environment and changing stimuli presented to the customer.

The preferences or likes and dislikes of a customer may better be determined and exploited to increase sales of items to the targeted customer. Biometric data associated with a customer may be used to identify a customer such as by a voice print or fingerprint. This may enable maximizing or optimizing sales of retail items sold to a customer at each visit the customer makes to the retail facility which translates into maximizing or optimizing the potential wallet share attributable to the customer.

In addition because marketing incentives are presented to a customer on a digital display device shelving space is no longer at a premium. The location of an item on the shelf such as at eye level as opposed to being placed at floor level will be less important in view of the marketing incentives being pushed to the customer as the customer shops.

The embodiments also permit increased monitoring of purchased and or offered items per customer segment and more effective marketing campaigns. Thus a retail outlet may conservatively increase sales profits by ten to twenty percent on a year to year basis.

In this manner marketing messages may be tailored to a particular customer to increase the customer s purchases and avoid a customer developing negative associations with a particular product due to inappropriate advertising.
