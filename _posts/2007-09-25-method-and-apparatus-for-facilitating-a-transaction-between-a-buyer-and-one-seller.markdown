title: Method and apparatus for facilitating a transaction between a buyer and one seller
abstract: A seller server receives an offer which specifies a type of product (e.g. a seat on a flight), at least one condition (e.g. destination and date of departure), and an offer price specified by a buyer. The seller server also receives an associated payment identifier that specifies a financial account, such as a credit card account. The payment identifier essentially “guarantees” the offer in that the seller may receive payment from the financial account even if the buyer attempts to renege. The seller determines whether to accept the offer, based on various factors such as the offer price and the availability of appropriate products to satisfy the conditions of the offer. If the offer is accepted, payment is provided to the seller using the payment identifier.

The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers.

Sellers of various products typically advertise a predetermined price for a product and customers pay that price for the product. The parent applications of the present application describe a method and apparatus that permits sellers to accept conditional purchase offers from buyers in which a conditional purchase offer specifies a price the buyer is willing to pay for the product. Each conditional purchase offer is further associated with a payment identifier that specifies a financial account to guarantee the offer. If a seller accepts the offer then that seller can be paid using the payment identifier. Even if the buyer later reneges the payment identifier guarantees that the seller receives appropriate compensation typically either the full offer price or a predetermined penalty payment.

The inventions disclosed in the parent applications are especially advantageous in selling excess perishable inventory such as seats on airline flights. For example the marginal cost to an airline of selling an additional seat is extremely low. Accordingly it can be profitable to sell a seat for a low buyer specified offer price especially if the chance of otherwise selling the seat is small e.g. soon before the flight departs .

However for various reasons sellers may believe correctly or incorrectly that the drawbacks of such a system as outweighing the advantages. For example a seller may believe that such a system forces undue competition among sellers for customers that submit offers. For example if the seller does not accept a reasonable offer another seller probably will. In fact the seller may feel compelled to accept unusually low offer prices out of fear that another seller may gain the repeat business of the customer. Although some sellers may have in fact incorrectly assessed the magnitude of such drawbacks the perception alone can prevent the sellers from participating in such a system.

Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide a method and apparatus for processing conditional purchase offers in a manner that reduced the concerns of sellers.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for processing conditional purchase offers in a manner that reduced the concerns of sellers.

In accordance with the present invention a seller server receives an offer which specifies a type of product e.g. a seat on a flight at least one condition e.g. destination and date of departure and an offer price specified by a buyer. The seller server also receives an associated payment identifier that specifies a financial account such as a credit card account. The payment identifier essentially guarantees the offer in that the seller may receive payment from the financial account even if the buyer attempts to renege. The seller determines whether to accept the offer based on various factors such as the offer price and the availability of appropriate products to satisfy the conditions of the offer. If the offer is accepted payment is provided to the seller using the payment identifier. The seller does not compete with other sellers for the received offers.

Applicants have recognized that sellers may prefer to work separately from other sellers in receiving offers from buyers. Furthermore a single seller may be able to provide its buyers with more flexibility in accepting their offers. Such flexibility would benefit the buyers as well as the seller.

The seller may benefit or believe it can benefit from the absence of other parties such as a central controller operated by a third party. Accordingly the seller may prefer to receive offers directly from buyers. In such an embodiment the seller may be able to circumvent certain transaction costs that would be paid to other parties.

As described in the parent applications of the present application the seller may derive significant benefit from receiving such offers from buyers. For example the seller may use revenue management techniques to determine whether it would be beneficial to accept a particular offer. The seller may also employ revenue management techniques in selecting products to fulfill the offers. In addition conventional e.g. retail sales of products at retail prices are unaffected by the acceptance of such offers since accepted offer prices are not generally known to the public. Thus the seller may sell at prices below retail prices thereby deriving additional revenue without starting a price war in which competing sellers lower their prices. Similarly sellers may have a reserve of demand that may be accessed to supplement retail demand.

As described herein one seller may receive offers directly from buyers or the one seller may employ a central server that receives offers for a plurality of sellers and forwards any given offer to one appropriate seller.

Referring to an apparatus includes a seller server that is in communication with buyer terminals and . The seller server may communicate with the buyer terminals and via an appropriate network such as the Internet. Each of the seller server and the buyer terminals and may comprise computers such as those based on the Intel Pentium microprocessor that are adapted to communicate via the Internet e.g. via a modem . Any number of buyer terminals may be in communication with the seller server .

The seller server may be a web server of a seller. The seller server can generate a web page that may be accessed via the World Wide Web and allow offers to be submitted to the seller. A buyer terminal may appropriately access the web page to communicate with the seller server in a manner known to those skilled in the art.

The central server may communicate with the buyer terminals and and with the seller servers and via an appropriate network such as the Internet. Each of the central server the buyer terminals and and the seller servers and may comprise computers such as those based on the Intel Pentium microprocessor that are adapted to communicate via the Internet e.g. via a modem . Any number of buyer terminals and seller servers may be in communication with the central server .

Referring to a seller server is representative of the seller server of and the seller servers and of . The seller server comprises a processor such as the Intel Pentium microprocessor. The processor is in communication with a data storage device such as an appropriate combination of magnetic optical and or semiconductor memory. For example the data storage device may comprise one or more of a ROM RAM and hard disk. The processor and the data storage device may each be i located entirely within a single computer or other computing device ii connected to each other by a remote communication medium such as a serial port cable telephone line or radio frequency transceiver or iii a combination thereof. In one embodiment the seller server may comprise one or more computers that are connected to a remote server computer for maintaining databases.

The data storage device stores a program for controlling the processor . The processor performs instructions of the program and thereby operates in accordance with the present invention and particularly in accordance with the methods described in detail herein. The program furthermore includes program elements that may be necessary such as an operating system and device drivers for allowing the processor to interface with computer peripheral devices. Appropriate device drivers and other necessary program elements are known to those skilled in the art and need not be described in detail herein.

The storage device also stores i a buyer database ii an inventory database iii an offer database and iv a collected demand database . The databases and are described in detail below and depicted with exemplary entries in the accompanying figures. As will be understood by those skilled in the art the schematic illustrations and accompanying descriptions of the databases presented herein are exemplary arrangements for stored representations of information. A number of other arrangements may be employed besides those suggested by the tables shown. Similarly the illustrated entries of the databases represent exemplary information and those skilled in the art will understand that the number and content of the entries can be different from those illustrated herein.

Referring to a table represents an embodiment of the buyer database . The table includes entries and each defining a buyer that submits one or more offers directly or indirectly to one seller server of a seller. Those skilled in the art will understand that that the table may include any number of entries. The table also defines fields for each of the entries and . The fields specify i a buyer identifier that uniquely identifies the buyer ii a name of the buyer iii an electronic mail email address for communication with the buyer iv an address of the buyer v a day telephone number vi an evening telephone number and vii a payment identifier that specifies a financial account that the buyer may use to render payment.

Referring to a table represents an embodiment of the inventory database . The table includes entries and each defining a product that a seller offers for sale. In the embodiment illustrated in the inventory database includes seats on flights and accordingly the seller is a seller of airline tickets. Those skilled in the art will understand that that the table may include any number of entries. The table also defines fields for each of the entries and . The fields specify i a flight number that uniquely identifies the flight ii a date of the flight iii an origination airport iv a destination airport v a time of departure of the flight vi a time of arrival of the flight vii a number of coach seats available on the flight and viii a number of business seats available on the flight.

Referring to a table represents an embodiment of the offer database . The table includes entries and each defining an offer that a buyer has submitted to the seller. In the embodiment illustrated in the offer database includes offers for seats on flights and accordingly the seller is a seller of airline tickets. Those skilled in the art will understand that that the table may include any number of entries. The table also defines fields for each of the entries and . The fields specify i an offer identifier that uniquely identifies the offer ii a buyer identifier that uniquely identifies the buyer that submitted the offer iii a payment identifier that specifies a financial account that the buyer may use to render payment iv an offer price that the buyer specifies v offer conditions that a product must satisfy to be acceptable to the buyer e.g. a destination an expiration of the offer vi whether the offer was accepted and vii one or more product purchased if the seller accepts the offer.

Referring to a table represents an embodiment of the collected demand database . The table includes entries and each defining demand received for a type of product. Demand for a type of product is measured based on the offers that are received for that type of product. In the embodiment illustrated in the type of product is a seat on a flight. To contrast a product would be one or more seats on a specific flight on a particular date from a particular origination airport and to a particular destination airport.

Those skilled in the art will understand that that the table may include any number of entries. The table also defines fields for each of the entries and . The fields specify i an origination which is typically defined as a city and a state ii a destination which is typically defined as a city and a state iii a departure date iv an offer price that was submitted v the number of units of demand that were received which is typically the aggregation of the number of tickets requested for each offer and vi a status of the demand in particular whether the offers composing the demand were accepted.

The fields such as origination destination and departure date define conditions that a product must satisfy. Other conditions besides those illustrated may be defined for seats on flights as well as for other types of products.

Referring to a graph represents illustrative demand collected for a specific type of product having certain conditions. The graph is depicted to illustrate various uses of the data the graph represents. As indicated by text the graph represents demand collected for seats on a flight from New York to Los Angeles on Dec. 20 1998. The graph may be generated based on offers received from buyers. For example the graph would be based on received offers that included or were consistent with the conditions represented by the graph . Those skilled in the art will understand that similar graphs may be generated for various types of products having various conditions. For example a graph could be generated to represent offers for seats on a flight from New York to Los Angeles. Alternatively a graph could be generated to represent offers for seats on a flight from New York to Los Angeles anytime between Dec. 15 1998 and Dec. 25 1998.

The graph includes a vertical axis to indicate units of demand and a horizontal axis to indicate offer prices. Each point on the graph thus indicates a quantity of offers having a specified offer price. For example a point indicates that there was demand for eighty seats at an offer price of 130. Such demand may have been derived from for example eighty offers for one seat each 80 1 80 or forty offers for two seats each 40 2 80 . A point indicates that there was demand for ten seats at an offer price of 200. Such demand may have been derived from for example ten offers for one seat each 10 1 10 or two offers for five seats each 2 5 10 . A curve indicates demand for the various points of the graph and may represent extrapolated demand at other points.

Referring to a flow chart illustrates an embodiment of a method for facilitating a transaction between a buyer and one seller. In particular in the illustrated embodiment a buyer device communicates via a central server to provide offers to one of a plurality of seller servers as illustrated by the apparatus of .

The central server receives an offer from a buyer step . As described above the offer specifies a type of product e.g. a seat on a flight at least one condition and an offer price specified by the buyer. The offer may specify the type of product explicitly or implicitly. For example on a web site where offer data is provided by the buyer the buyer may click a button or hyperlink or otherwise indicate the type of product. Alternatively the buyer may specify the type of product by selecting the seller to which the would like to submit the offer.

In an embodiment in which the type of product is a seat on a flight some possible conditions that the offer specifies are an origination a destination a date of departure and or a time of departure. Conditions may specify singular values e.g. time of departure 8 00 AM or ranges of values e.g. time of departure after 8 00 AM .

The central server also receives a payment identifier that specifies a financial account step . The payment identifier is associated with the offer such that if the offer is accepted the payment identifier may be used to render payment for the product purchased. In one embodiment the offer includes the payment identifier. In another embodiment the buyer submits the payment identifier after submitting the offer. In still another embodiment the buyer submits the payment identifier prior to submitting the offer. For example the buyer may submit the payment identifier during a registration process if registration is required by the central server. The payment identifier may be stored in the buyer database and available whenever it is necessary for payment to be received from the buyer. In such an embodiment the buyer could submit his payment identifier once and subsequently have that payment identifier used to render payment for numerous offers.

In one embodiment the financial account is a credit card account and thus the payment identifier may be a credit card number that specifies the credit card account. In other embodiments the payment identifier may specify debit card accounts savings or checking accounts or electronic cash. Those skilled in the art will understand that the payment identifier may specify other types of financial accounts and currencies.

The payment identifier is verified step . For example it may be verified whether the financial account exists and or whether the financial account has sufficient funds to pay the offer price. In addition funds in the financial account may be frozen to assure that they are available.

The offer price may define one or more forms of currency. For example the offer price may be a dollar amount e.g. 200 . The offer price may alternatively define a first amount of a first form of currency and a second amount of a second form of currency. For example one form of currency can be frequent flyer miles that the buyer desires to use and thus one exemplary offer price could be 100 and 10 000 frequent flyer miles .

In such an embodiment the payment identifier may specify one or more financial accounts for paying the various forms of currency. For example a single payment identifier such as a credit card number may specify both i a credit line which may be used to charge various dollar amounts and ii a number of frequent flyer miles associated with the credit card account. Alternatively two or more payment identifiers e.g. a credit card number and a frequent flyer identifier may be used to specify financial accounts each of which could be debited in accordance with the offer price.

The offer is then made available to one seller step . For example the offer may be transmitted via email to a seller server or the seller server may access a database where the central server stores the offer. The seller may be selected explicitly by the buyer. For example the central server may provide a list of available sellers and the buyer may in turn select one seller from the list. Alternatively the seller may be selected based on the type of product specified by the offer. For example if the offer specifies a seat on a flight and only one seller could fulfill such an offer e.g. the only airline to provide such a flight then that seller would be selected.

In response to the offer the seller may accept the offer and the central server receives the acceptance from the seller server step . Payment is then provided to the seller using the payment identifier step . In one embodiment the central server uses the payment identifier to debit the offer price from the financial account and payment is provided to a seller account. In another embodiment the payment identifier may be provided to the seller allowing the seller to directly debit the financial account. Those skilled in the art will realize other methods of rendering payment to the seller in accordance with the present invention.

The payment rendered to the seller is typically the offer price specified by the offer. In addition transaction fee may be rendered to the central server or other party. For example a flat fee e.g. 5 per offer or a commission e.g. 1 of the offer price may be charged to the buyer in addition to the offer price.

The payment identifier essentially guarantees payment to the seller and thus the seller is more willing to expend resources to review and accept such offers. Even if the buyer reneges or attempts to renege e.g. if the buyer indicates withdrawal of the offer after it was accepted the full payment e.g. the offer price may still be rendered in accordance with a pre existing contract between buyer and seller. Alternatively if the buyer reneges or attempts to renege a penalty payment amount may be charged to the financial account. Such a penalty amount may be for example a flat fee e.g. 25 or a predetermined percentage of the offer price e.g. 10 of the offer price . Accordingly in one embodiment it may be desirable to request that the buyer provide authorization to use the payment identifier to provide payment upon acceptance of the offer. Acceptance could be delayed until such authorization is received from the buyer.

Referring to a flow chart illustrates another embodiment of a method for facilitating a transaction between a buyer and one seller. In particular in the illustrated embodiment a buyer device communicates directly with a seller server as illustrated in .

The seller server receives an offer from a buyer step . As described above the offer specifies a type of product e.g. a seat on a flight at least one condition and an offer price specified by the buyer. The central server also receives an associated payment identifier that specifies a financial account step and the payment identifier is verified step . The seller server then determines whether to accept the offer step . Various methods may be used to determine whether to accept the offer as described below. If the offer is not accepted then the seller server sends an appropriate rejection message to the buyer step . Otherwise payment is rendered to the seller by using the payment identifier step and an appropriate acceptance message is sent to the buyer step .

Referring to a flow chart illustrates a method for facilitating a transaction between a buyer and one seller using a counter offer from the seller. As described above an offer from a buyer is received step and the seller server determines whether the offer should be accepted step . If so then as also described above payment is rendered step and an appropriate acceptance message is transmitted to the buyer step .

If the offer is not accepted by the seller then the seller server may create a counter offer that specifies the type of product and a counter offer price step . The counter offer price may be based on the offer price. For example the counter offer price may be a predetermined amount less than the offer price to provide the customer with an incentive to accept. The counter offer may indicate a specific product e.g. seat on flight on Dec. 20 1998 . Alternatively the counter offer may specify conditions e.g. a flight on Dec. 20 1998 from New York to Los Angeles without indicating a specific product.

The counter offer is transmitted to the buyer step and then a response from the buyer is received step . If the response indicates that the buyer accepted the counter offer step then payment is rendered using the payment identifier step .

Referring to a flow chart illustrates a method for selecting a product to fulfill an offer. The seller server determines all products that satisfy the conditions of the offer step . For example if the offer is for a seat on a flight and the offer specifies an origination a destination and a date of departure the seller server would determine all available seats on flights that depart on the specified date of departure from the origination to the destination. Additionally only certain products may be eligible to be used to fulfill an offer. For example only certain products may be allocated for fulfilling offers. Accordingly the remaining products may be reserved for conventional retail sales.

The seller server then determines a minimum acceptable price for each of these products step . The minimum price which is typically lower than the retail price of the product may be based on any of a number of factors. In one embodiment the seller server may determine the minimum price of a product based on the availability of the product. For example if many units of a particular product are unsold e.g. many seats on a particular flight then the minimum price may be lower than if fewer seats were unsold. In another embodiment the seller server may determine the minimum price of a product based on a comparison of predicted sales of the product and actual sales of the product. For example if the actual sales of the product are less than predicted sales of the product e.g. ten seats on a flight are sold at a certain time when it was anticipated that twenty seats would be sold then the minimum price may be lower than if fewer seats were unsold. In still another embodiment the seller server may determine the minimum price of a product based on the expected profit from the product. A combination of factors may be used in determining the minimum price of a product and those skilled in the art will realize various other factors for determining the minimum acceptable price of a product.

The seller server then selects a subset of products in which each product in the subset has a minimum price less than or equal to the offer price step . Such a subset thus defines the products that are acceptable to fulfill the offer. If the subset includes more than one product then a product is selected from the subset and the selected product is used to fulfill the offer step . The step of selecting a product from the subset may be based on any of a number of factors. For example the product may be selected based on i expected profit from the product ii the availability of the product iii a comparison of predicted sales of the product and actual sales of the product and iv whether actual sales of the product are less than predicted sales of the product. To illustrate the seller server may determine for each product an amount by which actual sales of the product are less than predicted sales of the product. Then the seller server could select the product that has the maximal amount by which actual sales of the product are less than predicted sales of the product.

It can be advantageous to perform load balancing in determining which product is selected to fulfill an offer. For example if seats on either of two similar flights would satisfy the conditions of an offer it can be advantageous to use a seat on the emptier flight to fulfill the offer. Otherwise one flight would have a much greater number of unsold seats.

Accordingly in another embodiment the step of selecting a product from the subset may comprise determining whether sales of a first set of products e.g. seats on the first flight are less than sales of a second set of products e.g. seats on the second flight . If sales of the first set are less than sales of the second set then a product from the first set is selected to fulfill the offer.

It can also be advantageous to allow the buyer to choose which product he would like to fulfill his offer. Accordingly in another embodiment the step of selecting a product from the subset may comprise transmitting an indication of the subset of products to the buyer and then receiving from the buyer a selection of one of the plurality of products.

Referring to a flow chart illustrates a method for accepting offers. In particular in the illustrated method acceptance of an offer is delayed to allow competitive offers to be received. Thus the seller may gain by not prematurely accepting an offer when a better offer may be subsequently received.

The seller server receives offers appropriate to a predetermined product until a predetermined time step and does not accept offers until that time. For example the seller server may delay until end of the day or until a predetermined number of offers are received. After the predetermined time is reached the offer having the greatest offer price is selected step and the selected offer is accepted step . Then as described above payment is received using the payment identifier step and an acceptance message is sent to the appropriate buyer that submitted the selected offer step . The method may then continue at step with more offers being received. Any offers that were received but not accepted may be stored and possibly evaluated during the next cycle. For example if in a first cycle one hundred offers are received and only one offer is accepted then in a second cycle another hundred offers may be received. Thus in the second cycle there are one hundred and ninety nine offers to evaluate and the offer having the highest offer price may be accepted.

It can be desirable to prevent the minimum acceptable price of a product from being disclosed. For example competitors of a seller could take advantage of the minimum acceptable price by adjusting their prices accordingly. In addition if buyers knew the minimum acceptable price of a product they would have no incentive to submit offer prices greater than the minimum acceptable price even if they would otherwise be willing to do so.

Referring to a flow chart illustrates a method for concealing a minimum acceptable price of a product. The illustrated method may performed for example for each offer received.

The seller server generates a random number between zero and one step in a manner known in the art. If the random number is not less than 0.01 step then the seller server determines whether to accept the offer using the normal methods of the present invention described herein step . Thus the normal methods are applied approximately ninety nine percent of the time 1 0.01 0.99 99 . Those skilled in the art will realize that the probability of performing the normal methods may be altered as desired as may the method of randomly selecting when to perform the normal methods.

If the random number is in the range from 0.00 to 0.01 then the seller server determines whether to accept the offer without considering the offer price step . In one embodiment the determination of whether to accept the offer may be based solely on product availability. For example if a product exists which may satisfy the offer then the offer may be accepted regardless of the offer price.

In the illustrated embodiment since approximately one percent of all offers are accepted based solely on product availability or based on other criteria besides the offer price offers having extremely small offer prices may still be accepted. Accordingly it would be difficult to ascertain the minimum acceptable price of the product. In addition since such offers may be accepted relatively rarely the loss to the seller of selling below its minimum acceptable price is likely to be insignificant.

As described above the present invention can allow a seller to accurately assess the demand for various products since submitted offers are guaranteed by some form of payment and thus are unlikely to be impulsive or capricious. Consequently the seller may use the demand assessment to its advantage in such tasks as setting the prices of products and setting the future supplies of products.

Referring to a flow chart illustrates a method for assessing demand for a product. As described above the seller server receives a plurality of offers that are appropriate for a product as well as associated payment identifiers step . An offer is appropriate for the product if the product satisfies each condition of the offer. Offers that are appropriate for other products are evaluated in a similar manner for the other products.

The seller server selects offers that were accepted or that are likely to be accepted step . Accepted offers may be advantageously used to assess true demand which is also acceptable to the seller i.e. demand that does not include unreasonably small offer prices .
