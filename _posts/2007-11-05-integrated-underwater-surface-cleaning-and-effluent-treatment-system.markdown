This application is related to U.S. Non Provisional patent application Ser. No. 11 998 978 filed Nov. 5 2007 entitled Underwater Surface Cleaning Vehicle For Integrated Cleaning and Effluent Treatment System which is based on U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 856 472 filing date Nov. 3 2006 hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the claimed invention may be manufactured used licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The following description relates generally to a method and apparatus for underwater hull cleaning and in particular to an integrated underwater hull cleaning and effluent treatment process.

Navy ships are periodically cleaned using open cycle cleaning devices such as for example submerged cleaning and maintenance platform SCAMP technology that utilizes integrated impeller and cleaning brush technology and results in the direct discharge of removed constituents such as for example biological fouling hull coatings and corrosion byproducts into surrounding water. Most antifouling coatings utilize heavy metals such as Cu and Zn as biocides that are released during cleaning operations at levels that can exceed water quality criteria. This has prompted governments to develop standards to manage this discharge or in some cases to prohibit open water cleaning of hulls with coatings that have antifoulants in them without special permission.

Waterborne underwater hull cleaning is critical to the worldwide operation and maintenance of Navy ships and impacts operating capability e.g. speed and maneuverability acoustic signature fuel efficiency and the maintainability and lifecycle of critical systems including underwater hull coatings impress current cathodic protection systems and propulsion systems.

Disclosed are systems and techniques for conducting integrated waterborne underwater hull cleaning using successive onboard vehicle processing and working fluid reuse with shore or pierside treatment of concentrated contaminants including heavy metal toxicants in antifouling paint with subsequent management and disposal of the wastestream by existing infrastructure.

In one aspect the invention is an integrated hull cleaning and treatment system. The system includes a cleaning vehicle for removing fouling from an underwater hull surface of a docked watercraft and for drawing water entrained material away from the cleaning region. The system further includes a land treatment unit for treating liquid waste received from the cleaning vehicle and converting the liquid waste into dewatered solids and treated effluents. According to the invention the land treatment unit has a gravity settling unit a chemical treatment unit a gravity thickening unit and a land intake port for receiving the liquid waste from the cleaning vehicle. In this aspect the invention includes a land intake hose having a first end and a second end the first end attached to the cleaning vehicle and the second end attached to the land intake port of the treatment unit.

In another aspect the invention is an environmentally friendly method of cleaning an underwater hull surface using an integrated hull cleaning and treatment system. According to this method the system includes a cleaning vehicle a land treatment unit and a flexible intake hose attached at one end to the cleaning vehicle and at another end to the land treatment unit. In this aspect the method includes removing with the cleaning vehicle fouling material from an underwater hull surface of a docked watercraft and drawing through the cleaning vehicle a particulate flow of water entrained material removed from the cleaning region. The method further includes conveying via the flexible intake hose liquid waste from the cleaning vehicle to the land treatment unit and converting in the land treatment unit the liquid waste into dewatered solids and treated effluents.

In another aspect the invention is a cleaning vehicle for cleaning an underwater surface the cleaning vehicle having a cleaning deck. In this aspect the cleaning deck includes a deck mouth and one or more circulation pumps downstream of the deck mouth for initiating cleaning deck suction onto the underwater surface and for initiating a particulate flow of water entrained material removed by the cleaning deck. The invention also includes one or more abrasion devices for removing fouling from the underwater surface. The cleaning vehicle further includes a discharge port for discharging the particulate flow of water entrained material to a remotely located treatment unit.

Other objects features and advantages will be apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

An integrated waterborne underwater hull cleaning system incorporates successive onboard vehicle processing and working fluid reuse with integrated treatment of concentrated contaminants including metal toxicants in antifouling paint and subsequent management and disposal of the wastestream by existing infrastructure.

Disclosed is an integrated waterborne underwater hull cleaning and integrated effluent treatment process that mitigates the release of removed constituents to surrounding waters. are exemplary flow diagrams of an integrated hull cleaning and effluent treatment system for performing the above recited functions. As illustrated in the system includes a ship hull having a hull surface the ship hull docked in relatively close proximity to a pier . The system further includes a cleaning vehicle . As shown in the system may include a cleaning vehicle that both cleans and treats cleaning effluents. shows an embodiment in which the vehicle cleans but does not directly treat cleaning effluents.

In the embodiment shown in the cleaning vehicle moves across the hull surface to physically remove fouling and other undesired buildups from hull surface. The removed material which includes fouling and other cleaning material such as antifoulant coatings having heavy metal toxicants along with surrounding water is sucked in through a mouth of the cleaning vehicle by applying a reduced pressure gradient. The resulting particulate flow of liquid waste is discharged directly to the remote treatment unit via the line described above. Regarding the cleaning vehicle shown in it should be noted that this vehicle may not necessarily be a single deck vehicle but may have more than one deck. For example the vehicle of may have a first deck that cleans and a second deck that is provided to control the cleaning process. Regarding the system of it should be noted that although show a ship hull the cleaning vehicle may be used to clean other submerged surfaces.

As stated above the different elements of the pre processing deck are also shown in . shows the deck having a solids processing unit which is a crusher . also shows the crusher motor and crusher control lever for operating the crusher . The crusher crushes and fractures solids removed during cleaning to for example about in or smaller while having minimal impact on flow. Incoming solids to be processed can be significant in size for example as large as 4 inches. also shows a circulation pump which may have a drive of about 30 HP. The pump initiates the flow needed to generate shroud suction the particulate flow of water entrained material and subsequent downstream pressures for solids separation separator fluid discharge or reuse and concentrate transport.

It should be noted that brushes the optionally included nozzles and the deck mouth are of similar structure to similar elements shown in . Cleaning vehicle may comprise a single deck structure or a multiple deck structure. For example the vehicle may have a first deck that cleans and a second deck that is provided to control the cleaning process. In a single deck structure the pump may be situated on the single deck. In a two deck structure the pump may be located on any of the deck structures.

As shown in the overflow of less dense liquid waste from the settling tank is directed to the chemical treatment unit enclosed in dotted lines . As illustrated the chemical treatment unit includes a neutralization chamber a coagulation chamber an injection chamber a maturation chamber and a clarifier . The chemical treatment unit also includes a sand recirculation pump and a hydrocyclone .

In the neutralization chamber neutralizing chemicals such as sodium hydroxide are added to the liquid waste overflow to neutralize the waste. In the chemical co precipitation chamber or coagulation chamber coagulants such as ferric chloride are added and mixed in a preferable rapid mix zone to ensure good coagulant dispersion. In the injection chamber ballasting sand and polymer are added to improve flocculation. Following the addition of sand and polymer in the injection chamber the flow is passed to a slow mix zone maturation chamber to promote stable floc formation. The flocculated mixture is then passed to the clarifier chamber for solid liquid separation. The clarified effluent is collected in the effluent tank . From the effluent tank clarified effluent is pumped by effluent pump via line or hose to either a public owned treatment works or other asset for final processing and discharge. Recirculation pump pumps solids settled at the bottom of the clarifier to the hydrocyclone . In the hydrocyclone the sludge is separated from the sand. The reclaimed sand is reintroduced into the sand and polymer injection chamber while the captured sludge is diverted to the sludge thickening unit for further processing.

In the sludge thickening unit polymers are added to thicken the sludge prior to slow stirring. Pump then pumps the thickened sludge to hoppers for dewatering. Although shows the use of hoppers to perform the dewatering process other dewatering systems may be substituted or used in a complementary manner. For instance a rotary press or other filtration system may be used.

The land treatment unit is designed to operate in both manual and fully automated modes operating in fill start and shut down daily and final sequences. In shutdown mode the intake of liquid waste from the cleaning vehicle is terminated and substituted with relatively clean water which may be surrounding water or hydrant fire main water to conduct final clean processing and flushing of the system. The intake of liquid waste may be stopped by design or due to sub system failure such as the underwater hull cleaning vehicle. The surrounding water or hydrant water enters the pier treatment unit via water intake line . In the shut down mode various tanks or subsystem are systematically eliminated from use cleaned and isolated. The process includes a combination of solids partitioning and separation within the system followed by isolating primary clarifier sludge thickening system and finally the chemical treatment module itself prior to directing final contents of chemical treatment module to bag filters via a drain tank and pump to the discharge riser location. In the shut down mode slurry that had been separated in the clarifier is diverted back to the hopper along line as shown in .

This above described apparatus enables integrated removing capturing containing collecting comminuting separating concentrating discharging reusing and transporting of hull cleaning wastewater from a moving vehicle stationary platform or other submerged partially submerged or floating base. The principal components and process may comprise an advanced waterborne underwater hull cleaning vehicle. An environmentally friendly method of cleaning an underwater hull surface and treating cleaning effluents is outlined below.

Step is the conveying of liquid waste from the cleaning vehicle to the land treatment unit. The liquid waste is transported to the land treatment unit via a flexible hose of about 600 feet. The hose may have a diameter of about 1.5 inches to about 2.5 inches depending on the consistency of the liquid waste. If the cleaning vehicle is one that includes a pre processing unit as outlined with respect to then the water entrained material is processed before it is transported to the land treatment unit. Consequently the liquid waste comprises a processed form of the particulate flow of water entrained material. If the cleaning vehicle is one that does not include a per processing unit as outlined with respect to then because there is no pre treatment of the particulate flow the liquid waste transported to the land treatment unit is actually the particulate flow of water entrained material.

Step is the converting of the liquid waste into dewatered solids and treated effluents. As outlined in the land treatment unit utilizes gravity settling chemical treatment with chemical co precipitation and gravity thickening to produce dewatered solids and cleaner treated effluents. The system may also include rotary press or other technologies to perform solids separation and dewatering functions. Step is the disposing of the dewatered solids into drums or other appropriate containers. Step is the discharging of treated effluents into a holding tank or to a sewage system for further treatment. Steps and are outline in the description of .

Step is the shut down and flushing of the pier treatment unit. As outlined with respect to the explanation of the flushing includes the step of shutting off the supply of liquid waste from the cleaning vehicle. The shutting off of the supply of liquid waste may be intentionally done during shut down or may occur unintentionally during operation due to system malfunction. During shut down alternate supply water is used for flushing that further includes the steps of pumping either surrounding water or hydrant water into the pier treatment unit via the water intake port directing the water into the chemical treatment module and filtering through the one or more bag filters the final treated contents of the unit. Step may also include the discharge of filtered liquids via the drain pump.
