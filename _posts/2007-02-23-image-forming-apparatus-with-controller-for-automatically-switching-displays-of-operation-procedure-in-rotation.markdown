The network I F portion controls various data transmission and reception to and from external apparatuses via a LAN using a network interface 10 100 Base TX . The HDD saves the image data read by the scanner section and an output format set in the image data.

The operation unit is provided with the display device the operation key assembly and the like shown in . The display device is constructed by a touch panel unit obtained by combining a touch panel and an LCD or the like. The display device displays various operation screens and enables the operator to input commands to execute various functions by touching a display surface displayed operation keys . The operation key assembly includes the start key the numeric pad and the like as described above.

The control unit includes a CPU and a display image data storage . The CPU governs the operation control of the composite apparatus . The display image data storage stores various still image data and moving image data to be displayed on the display device .

The CPU includes an operation controller an error detector a display controller and a judging device . The operation controller governs the operation control of the respect parts scanner section image processing section printer section etc. of the composite apparatus . The error detector detects operation errors of the respective parts during the operation of the composite apparatus . Operation errors include for example sheet jams in a sheet conveyance path from the sheet cassettes to the discharge tray the document conveying portion of the document feeding unit and the like and abnormal stops caused by the breakdown of the image forming assembly the transferring assembly and the like.

The display controller is for controlling the operation of the display device . The display controller causes the display device to display operation guiding screens for the operator. For example the display controller reads necessary moving image data from the display image data storage and reproduces them or reads necessary still image data from the display image data storage and displays screens showing an operation procedure of removing the operation error in an animated manner e.g. by continuously displaying a plurality of still images at the same position for animated display if the operation error has been detected by the error detector . The display controller also causes the display device to display a guide screen or the like used to receive the input of instructions on the respective functions such as a copy function and other screens.

The judging device judges whether or not the operator has completed operations to remove the operation error in accordance with signals and the like from sensors provided in the respective parts of the composite apparatus .

Next a first embodiment of a screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error in the composite apparatus is described. is a flow chart showing the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error in the composite apparatus is a diagram showing an example of a display screen showing that copying is in process is a diagram showing an example of a display screen in the event of an operation error caused by a sheet jam and is a transition diagram of display screens of the display device .

In the composite apparatus if the operation controller is causing the respective parts to perform operations in accordance with an operation instruction or the like from the operator inputted in the operation unit e.g. if the operation controller is causing the scanner section the image processing section and the printer section to perform a copying operation the display controller causes the display device to display a display screen showing that copying is in process as shown in Step S . Hereinafter description is given taking the case of the copying operation as an example.

If the error detector detects an operation error caused for example by a sheet jam during the copying operation YES in Step S the display controller reads data which are used to display the operation procedure of removing the operation error caused by the sheet jam on the display device from the display image data storage reproduces the data and causes them to be displayed on the display device Step S . This operation procedure is comprised of a plurality of operations and the data used to display the operation procedure include data of display screens showing the plurality of operations.

At this time the display controller causes screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure of removing the operation error caused by the sheet jam to be switched in rotation and displayed on the display device at intervals of specified periods for example as shown in to of . The display controller causes parts of the composite apparatus shown in the respective screens to be displayed in an animated manner to the operator as if the respective parts of the composite apparatus were moving.

For example the display controller causes the animated display of a state where a main unit cover is opened as shown in of and the animated display of a state where a sheet is taken out from the cassette as shown in of whereby the operator can visually and inspirationally grasp operations needed to be performed to remove the operation error. It should be noted that the display controller repeats the displays from the one shown in of upon finishing the display shown in of . Thus the operator can easily grasp the operations necessary to remove the sheet jam from the beginning to the end by seeing the display screens of the display device .

Here the screen of in to be first shown by the display controller is described in detail. As shown in a sheet jam occurring position a in the display controller causes the display device to display the external appearance of the composite apparatus at the present moment b in and the character explanation of a series of operations to be performed by the operator c in . A part of the character explanation on the operations representing an operation to be performed by the operator at this moment is displayed by the display controller in a format different from the other parts for example by shading. Further the display controller causes all the operations constituting the operation procedure necessary to remove the operation error caused by the sheet jam to be displayed on the display screen d in .

The display controller causes the total number of the operations of the operation procedure for the removal of the operation error caused by the sheet jam and the order of the presently displayed operation in all the operations to be displayed on the respective screens. For example if the total number of the operations of the operation procedure for the removal of the operation error caused by the sheet jam is eight as in this embodiment and the presently displayed operation is the first operation the display controller causes 01 08 to be displayed as shown in e of . By the presence of this display the operator can easily recognize that there are eight operations to be performed for the removal of the sheet jam and the first operation is presently displayed on the screen by seeing the display screen of the display device . The display format of the total number of the operations of the operation procedure for the removal of the operation error caused by the sheet jam and the order of the presently displayed operation in all the operations is not limited to a numerical display like 01 08 and may be another display format. For example the total number of the operations of the operation procedure and the order of the presently displayed operation in all the operations may be graphically displayed for example by means of images.

The display controller causes a part of the displays of all the operations d in corresponding to the screen displayed on the display device to be displayed differently from the preceding and succeeding operations Step S while causing the display device to display the respective screens of to in . For example the display controller causes the first one of the displays of all the operations to be highlighted may be displayed by shading or in a different color and the display format for causing the display to differ from the other ones is not limited when the first screen is displayed as shown in of . In this way the first display is made to stand out more than the other seven displays.

The display controller performs the above display color changing process for example 1 by preparing two kinds of graphics showing screens of the same content and having different colors and displaying the corresponding screen as the operation is completed display image data of different colors are stored in the display image data storage or 2 by rewriting a code for administering the color of the screen and displaying the screen as the operation is completed display controller processes and reproduces data read from the display image data storage .

The display controller continues to cause the display device to perform Steps S and S until the judging device judges that all the operations constituting the operation procedure have been completed by the operator NO in Step S . If the judging device judges that all the operations constituting the operation procedure have been completed by the operator YES in Step S the display controller ends the above display process on the display device .

By the display control as above the operator can accurately grasp which ones of the plurality of operations constituting the operation procedure to remove the operation error have been completed which operation is presently performed and how many operations have to be performed to complete all the operations by looking at the parts d and e of and the like on the display screen of the display device . In a conventional composite apparatus an operation guide for the removal of the operation error is displayed on a display device for an operator but the respective operation guides are separately displayed on one screen even when a plurality of operations have to be performed. Thus it has been difficult for the operator to grasp the progress of the operations for the removal of the operation error. However according to this embodiment such a problem residing in the conventional composite apparatus can be solved.

Next a second embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error in the composite apparatus is described. is a flow chart showing the second embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error in the composite apparatus and is a transition diagram of display screens of the display device . It should be noted that operations similar to those shown in are identified by the same reference numerals and are not described.

In the first embodiment shown in the part of the display of all the operations see d in corresponding to the screen displayed on the display device is displayed differently from the displays of the preceding and succeeding operations when the respective screens of to of are displayed on the display device Step S of . However in the second embodiment the display controller obtains information as to whether or not the respective operations of the operation procedure have been completed from the judging device Step S and causes parts of the display of all the operations see d in corresponding to the screens showing the operations judged to have been completed by the judging device to be displayed in a color different from the other operation s Step S .

For example when the judging device judges that the operator opened the main unit cover to take a sheet out in accordance with a guide 1. OPEN MAIN UNIT COVER AND TAKE SHEET OUT IF ANY displayed on the display device YES in Step S the display controller causes the first to third displayed portions showing the operations already completed by the operator out of the display of all the operations d in to be shown in a color different from the fourth to eighth displays showing the other operations regardless of which screen is being displayed on the display device as shown in to of . Thus the operator can recognize that the operations displayed in the different color have been already completed by seeing the display screen of the display device wherefore the operations already completed and those yet to be completed can be clearly distinguished. Further the operator can easily grasp the progress of the operations which operations have been completed out of a series of operations necessary to remove the operation error .

Next a third embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error in the composite apparatus is described. is a flow chart showing the third embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error is a diagram showing the transition of display screens showing an operation procedure in the event of an operation error caused by a sheet jam and is a diagram showing the transition of the display screens showing the operation procedure in the event of the operation error caused by the sheet jam wherein the display of the operations already completed is changed in color. It should be noted that operations similar to those of the first or second embodiment are not described.

If the judging device judges that one of a plurality of operations constituting the operation procedure has been completed by the operator YES in Step S while the display controller is causing the display device to display the respective screens showing the operation procedure in the event of an error in Step S the display controller changes the color of the display screen showing the operation completed by the operator Step S . For example the display controller changes the display color of the screen showing the already completed operation to sepia or the like and causes the display device to display the screen. At this time the display screens to are repeatedly displayed in rotation by the display controller as shown in . After the color of the display screens to showing the operations already completed by the operator is changed to the one different from the display screens to showing the other operations the display screens to are repeatedly displayed in rotation as shown in . Thus the operator can recognize that the operations displayed in the different color have been already completed by seeing the display screen of the display device wherefore the operations already completed and those yet to be completed can be clearly distinguished. Further the operator can easily grasp the progress of the operations which operations have been completed out of a series of operations necessary to remove the operation error .

The process of changing the display color of the screen by the display controller is performed for example 1 by preparing two kinds of graphics showing screens of the same contents and having different colors and displaying the corresponding screen as the operation is completed display image data of different colors are stored in the display image data storage or 2 by rewriting a code for administering the color of the screen and displaying the screen as the operation is completed display controller processes and reproduces data read from the display image data storage .

The display controller repeats the operations in Steps S to S Step S until the judging device judges that all the operations necessary to remove the operation error caused by the sheet jam have been completed. For example when the judging device judges that the operator opened the main unit cover to take a sheet out in accordance with a guide 1. OPEN MAIN UNIT COVER AND TAKE SHEET OUT IF ANY see displayed on the display device the display controller first causes the display screens to to be displayed in sepia different from the display screens showing the other operations as shown in . Further when the judging device judges that the operator completed an operation of pulling the cassette out to take a sheet out in accordance with guides 2. PULL CASSETTE OUT and 3. TAKE SHEET OUT the display controller causes the display device to display the display screens to also in sepia which is a color different from that of the remaining display screens .

Steps S to S are continued until the judging device judges that the operator has completed all the operations constituting the operation procedure YES in Step S . If the judging device judges that the operator has completed all the operations constituting the operation procedure NO in Step S the display controller ends the process. In other words the display controller ends the animated display of the operation procedure on the display device .

Although the display controller causes the display device to display the display screens showing the operations completed by the operator in the color e.g. sepia different from the one of the display screens showing the operations yet to be completed in this embodiment the present invention is not limited thereto. Any other mode can be adopted provided that the display format of the operations already completed by the operator is different from that of the other operations. is a diagram showing the transition of the display screens of the operation procedure in the event of an operation error caused by a sheet jam wherein already completed operations are displayed in a different format. For example the display controller may superimpose an image of DONE on the display screens showing the operations already completed by the operator as shown in so that these display screens have a display format different from those showing the operations yet to be completed. This process of changing the screen display by the display controller is similar to the above process of changing the screen display color by the display controller .

Next a fourth embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error in the composite apparatus is described. is a flow chart showing the fourth embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error and is a diagram showing the transition of display screens showing an operation procedure in the event of an operation error caused by a sheet jam wherein operations already completed are displayed in a different format. It should be noted that operations in similar to those of the third embodiment shown in are identified by the same reference numerals and not described.

In the screen display switching control of the third embodiment shown in the color of the display screens showing the operations already completed by the operator is changed. In addition the display controller may cause the display device to display the display screens showing the operations already completed by the operator after deleting the displays that became unnecessary to guide the operator Step S .

In this case the display controller causes the display device to display the display screens to in a color e.g. sepia different from that of the remaining display screens Step S and an animated display showing a state where a sheet is taken out from the cassette is deleted the animated display showing the state where a sheet is taken out from the cassette is not made particularly in the display screens as shown in for example if the judging device judges that the operator has completed an operation of pulling the cassette out and taking a sheet out in accordance with guides 2. PULL CASSETTE OUT. and 3. TAKE SHEET OUT . The operator already completed the operation of taking the sheet out from the cassette and it is not necessary to give the operation guide to the operator by this display at this point of time. Thus the display content is simplified by not displaying the unnecessary operation guide whereby the operator can more easily grasp operations still needed to be performed.

The process of changing the screen display by the display controller is performed for example 1 by preparing graphics for screen displays corresponding to the display contents and the respective graphics are used depending on whether or not the operation has been completed or 2 by rewriting a code for administering the color of the screen and the display content and displaying the screen as the operation has been completed.

Next fifth to eighth embodiments of the screen display switching control of a display device in the event of an operation error in a composite apparatus are described. is a control block diagram of a composite apparatus executing the screen display switching controls of the fifth to eighth embodiments. It should be noted that the same construction as in the composite apparatus shown in are not described.

A display device of an operation unit is provided with a frame advance key a frame rewind key and a pause key instruction receiving portion . The frame advance key receives an instruction to switch the display screen of the display device to a next screen. The pause key receives an instruction to pause the display screen of the display device to obtain a still image and an instruction to cancel the pause of the display screen. The frame rewind key receives an instruction to switch the display screen of the display device to one preceding screen. Images of the frame advance key the frame rewind key and the pause key are displayed on the display device by a display controller .

Next the fifth embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error in the composite apparatus is described. is a flow chart showing the fifth embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error is a diagram showing the transition of display screens showing an operation procedure in the event of an operation error caused by a sheet jam and is a diagram showing a display example of detailed explanation. It should be noted that operations similar to those of the first to fourth embodiments are not described.

If an error detector detects an operation error for example caused by a sheet jam during a copying operation YES in Step S the display controller reads data corresponding to an operation procedure necessary to remove the operation error caused by the sheet jam from a display image data storage and reproduces them thereby causing the display device to display this operation procedure Step S . At this time the display controller causes the display device to repeatedly display screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure of removing the operation error caused by the sheet jam in rotation at a predetermined speed for example as shown in to of wherein images of the frame advance key the frame rewind key and the pause key are displayed in each screen.

If the operator operates the frame advance key the pause key or the frame rewind key YES in Step S while the display controller is causing the display device to display the respective display screens of the operation procedure in Step S the display controller performs the following process.

If the operator presses the frame advance key down FRAME ADVANCE KEY in Step S the display controller causes the screen succeeding the one being displayed at this moment to be displayed Step S and resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from a state where this succeeding screen is displayed Step S . For example the display controller causes the display device to display the screen shown in of if the operator presses the frame advance key down while the screen shown in of is displayed on the display device . Then the display controller causes the respective screens to be repeatedly displayed in rotation from a state where the screen shown in of is displayed on the display device .

Further if the operator presses the frame rewind key down FRAME REWIND KEY in Step S the display controller causes the screen preceding the one being displayed at this moment by one frame to be displayed Step S and resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from a state where this preceding screen is displayed Step S . For example the display controller causes the display device to display the screen shown in of if the operator presses the frame rewind key down while the screen shown in of is displayed on the display device . Then the display controller causes the respective screens to be repeatedly displayed in rotation from a state where the screen shown in of is displayed on the display device .

Further if the operator presses the pause key down PAUSE KEY in Step S the display controller specifies an operation guided by the screen displayed on the display device at this moment reads the display data of detailed explanation corresponding to this operation from the display image data storage and causes the display device to display the read data Step S . For example the display controller reads the data of detailed explanation corresponding to the operation operation indicated by a guide OPEN MAIN UNIT COVER AND TAKE SHEET OUT IF ANY i.e. operation of opening the main unit cover and taking a sheet out guided by this display screen from the display image data storage and causes the display device to display a screen as shown in if the operator presses the pause key down while the screen shown in of is displayed on the display device . On this display screen of the detailed explanation a BACK button utilizing a touch sensor function used to input an instruction to return the display on the display device to the initial animated display for guiding the operation procedure is displayed by the display controller .

If the BACK button is pressed down by the operator YES in Step S while the display controller is causing the display device to display the detailed explanation as described above the display controller causes the display screen displayed when the pause key was pressed down by the operator in Step S to be displaced again on the display device Step S and the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure is resumed from this display screen Step S .

Unless the BACK button is pressed down by the operator NO in Step S the display controller causes the display device to display the above detailed explanation until the judging device judges that the operation guided by this detailed explanation has been completed NO in Step S Step S . If the judging device judges that the operation guided by this detailed explanation has been completed YES in Step S the display controller causes the screen showing the operation succeeding the one judged to have been completed to be displayed Step S and resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure Step S . For example if it is assumed that the operation of the operator to open the main unit cover and take a sheet out is guided by the screen of the detailed explanation shown in screen of the detailed explanation corresponding to the screens of to in and the completion of this operation is judged by the judging device at this time the display controller causes the display device to display the screen of in showing the operation succeeding the completed one.

In this control the display controller causes the screen showing the operation succeeding the one judged to have been completed to be displayed Step S if the judging device judges that the operation guided by the detailed explanation has been completed as described above YES in Step S . However the display controller may resume the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from the first screen showing the operation procedure instead of the operation in Step S.

The repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure by the display controller is continued until the judging device judges the completion of all the operations necessary to remove the operation error by this operation procedure YES in Step S and the display controller ends the process when the judging device judges the completion of all the operations necessary to remove the operation error by this operation procedure NO in Step S . In other words the display controller ends the animated display of the operation procedure on the display device .

In this way the operator can obtain further information on the operation being displayed since the detailed explanation on the operation guided by the display screen of the display device is displayed on the display device if the pause key is pressed down. The understanding of this operation can be deepened. If the operator completes the operation guided by this detailed explanation during the display of the detailed explanation the screen showing the operation succeeding the completed one is displayed on the display device wherefore the operator can immediately recognize the operation to be performed next.

Next the sixth embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error in the composite apparatus is described with reference to as well as . is a flow chart showing the sixth embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error. It should be noted that operations in similar to those of the fifth embodiment shown in are identified by the same reference numerals and not described.

In this sixth embodiment if the pause key is pressed down by the operator while the display controller is causing the display device to display the moving images of the operation procedure YES in Step S PAUSE KEY in Step S the display controller detects whether this operation is judged to have been completed or not to have been completed yet by the judging device . The display controller causes the display device to display the detailed description on the operation not completed yet S only if the operation is judged not to have been completed yet NO in Step S .

If the pause key is pressed down by the operator while the display controller is causing the display device to display the moving images of the operation procedure but the operation guided by the display screen at this moment is judged to have been completed by the judging device YES in Step S the display controller causes the screen at this moment to pause and to be displayed on the display device Step S . For example the display controller causes the screen of in to pause and to be displayed on the display device while causing the display device to display the screen shown in of . It should be noted that the display controller causes a replay key utilizing a touch sensor function to be displayed on this paused screen. The replay key cancels the paused state to receive an instruction to resume the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure.

If the replay key is pressed down by the operator YES in Step S while the display controller is causing the display of the display device to pause the display controller resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from this paused screen Step S . Unless the replay key is pressed down by the operator NO in Step S the display controller continues the display of the screen paused in Step S until the judging device judges the completion of all the operations necessary to remove the operation error by this operation procedure YES in Step S and ends the process when the judging device judges the completion of all the operations necessary to remove the operation error by this operation procedure NO in Step S .

According to this control the display controller does not cause the display device to display the detailed explanation on the operation already completed and unnecessary to be performed by the operator even if the operator presses the pause key down. Therefore the operator needs not read the detailed explanation for unnecessary operations.

Next the seventh embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error in the composite apparatus is described with reference to as well as . is a flow chart showing the seventh embodiment of the screen display switching control of the display device in the event of an operation error. It should be noted that operations similar to those of the first to sixth embodiments are not described.

In the seventh embodiment if an instruction to switch the display screen of the display device hereinafter display switching instruction is received by the frame advance key the pause key or the frame rewind key through an operation by the operator while the display controller is causing the display device to display the above moving images the display controller performs the following process in accordance with the content of this display switching instruction.

If the frame rewind key receives an instruction to switch the display screen of the display device to the first preceding screen FRAME REWIND KEY in Step S the display controller switches the screen being displayed at this moment to the first preceding screen and causes the screen after the switch to pause and to be displayed as a still image on the display device Step S . For example if the frame rewind key receives the above instruction from the operator while the display controller is causing the display device to display the screen shown in of the display controller cause the display device to display the screen shown in of and cause the display to pause in this state. Although the display controller causes the screen switch to pause at this screen the animated display on this screen may not pause same holds for Steps S to S .

Further if the frame advance key receives an instruction to switch the display screen of the display device to the first succeeding screen screen advanced by one frame FRAME ADVANCE KEY in Step S the display controller switches the screen being displayed at this moment to the first succeeding screen next screen and causes the screen after the switch to pause and to be displayed as a still image on the display device Step S . For example if the frame advance key receives the above instruction from the operator while the display controller is causing the display device to display the screen shown in of the display controller causes the display device to display the screen shown in of and causes the display to pause in this state.

Further if the pause key receives an instruction to pause the display screen of the display device PAUSE KEY in Step S the display controller causes the screen being displayed at this moment to pause and to be displayed as a still image on the display device Step S . For example if the pause key receives the above instruction from the operator while the display controller is causing the display device to display the screen shown in of the display controller causes the display device to pause at the screen shown in of being displayed at this moment.

If an instruction to cancel the paused display is received through the operation of the pause key by the operator while the display controller is causing the display of the display device to pause by any one of the above processings YES in Step S the display controller resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from this paused screen Step S . Thereafter this process returns to Step S.

If the judging device judges that the operation guided by the display device has been completed by the operator YES in Step S although no instruction to cancel the paused display has been received NO in Step S while the display controller is causing the display of the display device to pause as described above the display controller resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from this paused screen Step S if the judging device judges that all the operations necessary to remove the operation error caused by the sheet jam have not been completed yet YES in Step S . Thereafter this process returns to Step S. It should be noted that the display controller ends this process if the judging device judges that the operation guided by the display device has been completed by the operator YES in Step S and that all the operations necessary to remove the operation error caused by the sheet jam have been completed NO in Step S . In other words the display controller ends the animated display of the operation procedure on the display device .

In this way only by pressing the frame advance key or the frame rewind key down the operator can cause the screen different from the one being displayed at this moment to be displayed as a still image on the display device .

If the operator has pressed the frame advance key down FRAME ADVANCE KEY in Step S the display screen discriminator discriminates whether the operator has pressed for a shorter period or for a longer period Step S . If discriminating that the operator has pressed for a shorter period NO in Step S the display screen discriminator discriminates the screen succeeding the one being displayed at this moment as the screen to be displayed on the display device Step S . The display controller resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from this discriminated screen succeeding screen Step S . For example if the frame advance key is pressed down for a shorter period by the operator while the screen shown in of is being displayed on the display device the display controller causes the display device to display the screen shown in of . The display controller repeatedly displays the respective screens in rotation from the state where the screen in of is displayed on the display device .

On the other hand if discriminating that the operator has pressed for a longer period YES in Step S the display screen discriminator discriminates the operation already completed by the operator based on a judgment result of the judging device and discriminates the screen showing the operation succeeding this completed operation as the screen to be displayed on the display device Step S . The display controller resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from this discriminated screen Step S . For example if the frame advance key is pressed down for a longer period by the operator and the operation guided by 1. OPEN MAIN UNIT COVER AND TAKE SHEET OUT IF ANY displayed on the display device i.e. the operation of the operator to open the main unit cover and to take a sheet out is judged to have been completed by the judging device while the screen shown in of is being displayed on the display device the display controller causes the display device to display the screen shown in of showing the operation succeeding this completed operation. The display controller repeatedly displays the respective screens in rotation from the state where the screen in of is displayed on the display device .

If the operator has pressed the frame rewind key down FRAME REWIND KEY in Step S the display screen discriminator discriminates whether the operator has pressed for a shorter period or for a longer period Step S .

The display controller resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from this discriminated screen first preceding screen Step S . For example if the frame rewind key is pressed down for a shorter period by the operator while the screen shown in of is being displayed on the display device the display controller causes the display device to display the screen shown in of . The display controller repeatedly displays the respective screens in rotation from the state where the screen in of is displayed on the display device .

On the other hand if discriminating that the operator has pressed for a longer period YES in Step S the display screen discriminator discriminates the first screen of the operation procedure being displayed as the screen to be displayed on the display device Step S . The display controller resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from this discriminated screen first screen Step S . For example if the frame rewind key is pressed down for a longer period by the operator while the screen shown in of is being displayed on the display device the display controller causes the display device to display the first screen shown in of . The display controller repeatedly displays the respective screens in rotation from the state where the screen in of is displayed on the display device .

If the operator has pressed the pause key PAUSE KEY in Step S the display controller causes the screen being displayed at this moment to pause i.e. the display screen is not switched to another screen showing another operation and to be displayed as a still image on the display device Step S . For example if the pause key is pressed down by the operator while the display controller is causing the display device to display the screen shown in of the display controller causes the screen shown in of being displayed at this moment to pause and to be displayed on the display device . If the pause key is pressed down again by the operator YES in Step S while the display controller is causing the display of the display device to pause in this way the display controller resumes the repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure from this paused screen Step S .

Unless the pause key is pressed down again by the operator NO in Step S the display controller keeps the paused state until the judging device judges that all the operations necessary to remove the operation error by this operation procedure have been completed YES in Step S . The display controller ends this process if the judging device judges that all the operations have been completed NO in Step S .

The repeated display of the respective screens showing a series of operations constituting the operation procedure by the display controller Step S is continued until the judging device judges that all the operations necessary to remove the operation error by this operation procedure have been completed YES in Step S and the display controller ends this process when the judging device judges that all the operations have been completed NO in Step S .
