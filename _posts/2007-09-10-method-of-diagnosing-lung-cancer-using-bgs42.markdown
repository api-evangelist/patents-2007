Also provided are vectors host cells antibodies and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing said polypeptides. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods for applying these novel BGS 42 polypeptides to the diagnosis treatment and or prevention of various diseases and or disorders related to these polypeptides.

Tubulin a subunit of microtubules is subjected to specific enzymatic post translational modifications including cyclic tyrosine removal and addition at the COOH terminus of the alpha subunit during normal cellular metabolism. Tubulin is normally tyrosinated in cycling cells. It has previously been shown that de tyrosinated tubulin accumulates in cancer cells during tumor progression in nude mice. Tubulin de tyrosination results from the suppression of tubulin tyrosine ligase and leads to an unbalanced activity of another enzyme tubulin carboxypeptidase. Apparently the loss of tyrosinate tubulin represents a strong selective advantage for cancer cells.

The occurrence and significance of tubulin de tyrosination in human breast tumors has been investigated. Cancer cells with de tyrosinated tubulin were observed in 53 of the tumors and were predominant in 19.4 of the tumors tested. Tubulin de tyrosination has also been shown to correlate to a high degree of significance with markers of tumor aggressiveness Mialhe et al. 2001 .

There appears to be three genes described in the literature whose gene products could potentially possess tubulin tyrosine ligase activity HOLLT GENBANK Accession No. gi 6683745 TTLH Human Tubulin tyrosine ligase like protein GENBANK Accession No. gi 20455371 and TTLL human Tubulin tyrosine ligase like protein 1 GENBANK Accession No. gi 20455347 Gene 257 1 109 117 2000 Genome Res. 11 3 422 435 2001 and Nature 402 6761 489 495 1999 . The regulation of these genes in normal cells in addition to transformed cells remains to be determined as does the mechanism of their loss in enzymatic tyrosine ligase activity during tumor progression. It has been proposed that a reversible phosphorylation event of TTL mediated by a protein kinase may be the basis of TTL loss of function Idriss 2001 .

Using the above examples it is clear the availability of a novel cloned tubulin tyrosine ligase protein provides an opportunity for further advancements in the physiological function of tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins and may be useful for the identification of tubulin tyrosine ligase agonists or stimulators which might stimulate and or bias tubulin tyrosine ligase action as well as in the identification of tubulin tyrosine ligase inhibitors. All of which might be therapeutically useful under different circumstances.

Table I provides a summary of the novel polypeptides and their encoding polynucleotides of the present invention.

Table II illustrates the preferred hybridization conditions for the polynucleotides of the present invention. Other hybridization conditions may be known in the art or are described elsewhere herein.

Table III provides a summary of various conservative substitutions encompassed by the present invention.

The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention and the Examples included herein.

The invention provides a novel human sequence that encodes a tubulin tyrosine ligase protein with substantial homology to other tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins. Members of the tubulin tyrosine ligase protein family serve as proliferation inhibitors whereby loss of tubulin tyrosine ligase activity results in cellular proliferation. Tubulin tyrosine ligases have been implicated in a number of diseases and or disorders which include but are not limited to cancer aberrant cellular proliferation and aberrant cellular differentiation. Moreover members of the tubulin tyrosine ligase protein family have also been implicated in having anti proliferative roles as described herein.

In the present invention isolated refers to material removed from its original environment e.g. the natural environment if it is naturally occurring and thus is altered by the hand of man from its natural state. For example an isolated polynucleotide could be part of a vector or a composition of matter or could be contained within a cell and still be isolated because that vector composition of matter or particular cell is not the original environment of the polynucleotide. The term isolated does not refer to genomic or cDNA libraries whole cell total or mRNA preparations genomic DNA preparations including those separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto blots sheared whole cell genomic DNA preparations or other compositions where the art demonstrates no distinguishing features of the polynucleotide sequences of the present invention.

In specific embodiments the polynucleotides of the invention are at least 15 at least 30 at least 50 at least 100 at least 125 at least 500 or at least 1000 continuous nucleotides but are less than or equal to 300 kb 200 kb 100 kb 50 kb 15 kb 10 kb 7.5 kb 5 kb 2.5 kb 2.0 kb or 1 kb in length. In a further embodiment polynucleotides of the invention comprise a portion of the coding sequences as disclosed herein but do not comprise all or a portion of any intron. In another embodiment the polynucleotides comprising coding sequences do not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene i.e. 5 or 3 to the gene of interest in the genome . In other embodiments the polynucleotides of the invention do not contain the coding sequence of more than 1000 500 250 100 50 25 20 15 10 5 4 3 2 or 1 genomic flanking gene s .

In as least one embodiment the polynucleotides comprise the 5 upstream non coding promoter of the BGS 42 gene SEQ ID NO 27 .

As used herein a polynucleotide refers to a molecule having a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO 1 or the cDNA contained within the clone deposited with the ATCC . For example the polynucleotide can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full length cDNA sequence including the 5 and 3 untranslated sequences the coding region with or without a signal sequence the secreted protein coding region as well as fragments epitopes domains and variants of the nucleic acid sequence. Moreover as used herein a polypeptide refers to a molecule having the translated amino acid sequence generated from the polynucleotide as broadly defined.

In the present invention the full length sequence identified as SEQ ID NO 1 was often generated by overlapping sequences contained in one or more clones contig analysis . A representative clone containing all or most of the sequence for SEQ ID NO 1 was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection ATCC . As shown in Table I each clone is identified by a cDNA Clone ID Identifier and the ATCC Deposit Number. The ATCC is located at 10801 University Boulevard Manassas Va. 20110 2209 USA. The ATCC deposit was made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for purposes of patent procedure. The deposited clone is inserted in the pSport1 Life Technologies using the NotI and SalI restriction endonuclease sites as described herein.

Unless otherwise indicated all nucleotide sequences determined by sequencing a DNA molecule herein were determined using an automated DNA sequencer such as the Model 373 preferably a Model 3700 from Applied Biosystems Inc. and all amino acid sequences of polypeptides encoded by DNA molecules determined herein were predicted by translation of a DNA sequence determined above. Therefore as is known in the art for any DNA sequence determined by this automated approach any nucleotide sequence determined herein may contain some errors. Nucleotide sequences determined by automation are typically at least about 90 identical more typically at least about 95 to at least about 99.9 identical to the actual nucleotide sequence of the sequenced DNA molecule. The actual sequence can be more precisely determined by other approaches including manual DNA sequencing methods well known in the art. As is also known in the art a single insertion or deletion in a determined nucleotide sequence compared to the actual sequence will cause a frame shift in translation of the nucleotide sequence such that the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by a determined nucleotide sequence will be completely different from the amino acid sequence actually encoded by the sequenced DNA molecule beginning at the point of such an insertion or deletion.

Using the information provided herein such as the nucleotide sequence in SEQ ID NO 1 a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention encoding the BGS 42 polypeptide may be obtained using standard cloning and screening procedures such as those for cloning cDNAs using mRNA as starting material. Illustrative of the invention the nucleic acid molecule described in SEQ ID NO 1 was discovered in a mixture of human circular brain and testis first strand cDNA library.

A polynucleotide of the present invention also includes those polynucleotides capable of hybridizing under stringent hybridization conditions to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO 1 the complement thereof or the cDNA within the clone deposited with the ATCC . Stringent hybridization conditions refers to an overnight incubation at 42 degree C. in a solution comprising 50 formamide 5 SSC 750 mM NaCl 75 mM trisodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 5 Denhardt s solution 10 dextran sulfate and 20 g ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by washing the filters in 0.1 SSC at about 65 degree C.

Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the polynucleotides of the present invention at lower stringency hybridization conditions. Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency salt conditions or temperature. For example lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 degree C. in a solution comprising 6 SSPE 20 SSPE 3M NaCl 0.2M NaH2PO4 0.02M EDTA pH 7.4 0.5 SDS 30 formamide 100 ug ml salmon sperm blocking DNA followed by washes at 50 degree C. with 1 SSPE 0.1 SDS. In addition to achieve even lower stringency washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations e.g. 5 SSC .

Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt s reagent BLOTTO heparin denatured salmon sperm DNA and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above due to problems with compatibility.

Of course a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA sequences such as any 3 terminal polyA tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing or to a complementary stretch of T or U residues would not be included in the definition of polynucleotide since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly A stretch or the complement thereof e.g. practically any double stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo dT as a primer .

The polynucleotide of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxyribonucleotide which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example polynucleotides can be composed of single and double stranded DNA DNA that is a mixture of single and double stranded regions single and double stranded RNA and RNA that is mixture of single and double stranded regions hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single stranded or more typically double stranded or a mixture of single and double stranded regions. In addition the polynucleotide can be composed of triple stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide may also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. Modified bases include for example tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and RNA thus polynucleotide embraces chemically enzymatically or metabolically modified forms.

The polypeptide of the present invention can be composed of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds i.e. peptide isosteres and may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene encoded amino acids. The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes such as posttranslational processing or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide including the peptide backbone the amino acid side chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched for example as a result of ubiquitination and they may be cyclic with or without branching. Cyclic branched and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation acylation ADP ribosylation amidation covalent attachment of flavin covalent attachment of a heme moiety covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol cross linking cyclization disulfide bond formation demethylation formation of covalent cross links formation of cysteine formation of pyroglutamate formylation gamma carboxylation glycosylation GPI anchor formation hydroxylation iodination methylation myristoylation oxidation pegylation proteolytic processing phosphorylation prenylation racemization selenoylation sulfation transfer RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation and ubiquitination.

An alignment of the BGS 42 polypeptide with these proteins is provided in .

The determined nucleotide sequence of the BGS 42 cDNA in SEQ ID NO 1 contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of about 541 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular weight of about 59.9 kDa. The amino acid sequence of the predicted BGS 42 polypeptide is shown in SEQ ID NO 2 . The BGS 42 protein shown in was determined to share significant identity and similarity to several known tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins.

The BGS 42 polypeptide was predicted to comprise one TTL family domain TTL1 located from about amino acid 73 to about amino acid 365 TTL1 SEQ ID NO 14 of SEQ ID NO 2 . In this context the term about may be construed to mean 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 amino acids beyond the N Terminus and or C terminus of the above referenced TTL family domain polypeptide.

In preferred embodiments the following TTL family domain is encompassed by the present invention EDIDTSADAVEDLTEAEWEDLTQQYYSLVHGDAFISNSRNYFSQCQALLNRIT SVNPQTDIDGLRNIWIIKPAAKSRGRDIVCMDRVEEILELAAADHPLSRDNKW VVQKYIETPLLICDTKFDIRQWFLVTDWNPLTIWFYKESYLRFSTQRFSLDKL DSAIHLCNNAVQKYLKNDVGRSPLLPAHNMWTSTRFQEYLQRQGRGAVWG SVIYPSMKKAIAHAMKVAQDHVEPRKNSFELYGADFVLGRDFRPWLIEINSSP TMHPSTPVTAQLCAQVQEDTIKVAVDRSCDI SEQ ID NO 14 . Polynucleotides encoding this polypeptide are also provided. The present invention also encompasses the use of this BGS 42 TTL family domain polypeptide as an immunogenic and or antigenic epitope as described elsewhere herein.

The BGS 42 polypeptide was also determined to comprise several conserved cysteines at amino acid 155 238 347 363 and or 388 of SEQ ID No 2 . Conservation of cysteines at key amino acid residues is indicative of conserved structural features which may correlate with conservation of protein function and or activity.

The BGS 42 polypeptide was also determined to comprise a conserved cAMP dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site located at amino acid 306 to amino acid 309 of SEQ ID NO 2 . This cAMP dependent protein kinase phosphorylation is found in other tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins and may be essential for either the activation or inhibition of tubulin tyrosine ligase activity.

In preferred embodiments the present invention encompasses a polynucleotide lacking the initiating start codon in addition to the resulting encoded polypeptide of BGS 42. Specifically the present invention encompasses the polynucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 156 thru 1775 of SEQ ID NO 1 and the polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 2 thru 541 of SEQ ID NO 2. Also encompassed are recombinant vectors comprising said encoding sequence and host cells comprising said vector.

The present invention also encompasses a polynucleotide that encodes at least 424 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO 2. Preferably such a polypeptide has tubulin ligase activity. The present invention also encompasses a polynucleotide that encodes about 424 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO 2 wherein the term about may be construed to mean 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 amino acids beyond the N Terminus and or C terminus of the above referenced polypeptide. The present invention also encompasses a polynucleotide comprising at least 1272 contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO 1.

Expression profiling designed to measure the steady state mRNA levels encoding the BGS 42 polypeptide using SYBR green quantitative PCR see showed predominately in the testis tissue. Expression of BGS 42 was also significantly expressed in brain liver and to a lesser extent in other tissues.

Additional expression profiling designed to measure the steady state mRNA levels encoding the BGS 42 polypeptide using SYBR green quantitative PCR in normal versus tumor samples see showed predominate differential expression in lung tissue relative to lung tumor tissue with lung tumor tissue showing a 25 fold decrease in BGS 42 expression relative to normal lung tissues.

Expanded expression profiling designed to measure the steady state mRNA levels encoding the BGS 42 polypeptide using TAQMAN quantitative PCR see showed BGS 42 was expressed predominately in the vas deferens. Expression of BGS 42 was also significantly expressed in lymph gland pituitary placenta and to a lesser extent in other tissues.

Additional expanded expression profiling data was also performed on mRNA isoalted from several testis tumors using TAQMAN quantitative PCR see showed that the testis specific expression of BGS 42 was lost in testis tumor tissue. The observation that BGS 42 is specifically downregulated in tumor samples suggests BGS 42 may play a role in tumor suppression either directly or indirectly. Thus agonists directed against the BGS 42 polynucleotide or polypeptide would be useful for the treatment of tumors particularly lung and testis tumors. In addition BGS 42 polynucleotides may be useful as a diagnostic in identifying potential proliferative and or tumor tissues relative to normal tissues particularly in the detection of lung and testis tumors or proliferative conditions. Such a diagnostic would utilize the observed loss of BGS 42 expression in lung and or testis tumor tissue as an indicia of proliferative state relative to the detectable expression in normal lung and or testis tissues. Moreover such a diagnostic may be useful for the detection of other tumor types by comparing BGS 42 expression in normal versus test tissue with loss of BGS 42 in the test tissue being diagnostic of a proliferative condition.

Based upon the strong homology to members of the tubulin tyrosine ligase protein family the BGS 42 polypeptide is expected to share at least some biological activity with tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins including but limited to HOTTL TTL PIG TTLH Hu and TTLL Hu and more preferably tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins found within testis lymph node pituitary placenta and or vas deferens cells and tissues in addition to the tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins referenced elsewhere herein or otherwise known in the art.

The present invention is also directed to the upstream non coding promoter sequence of the BGS 42 gene SEQ ID NO 27 . The polynucleotide sequence contains a sequence of 2241 nucleotides with nucleotides 2057 to 1 of SEQ ID NO 27 representing the upstream promoter sequence. Analysis of the BGS 42 promoter region led to the identification of three CpG islands located from about nucleotide 1968 to about 1746 from about nucleotide 1232 to about 936 and or from about nucleotide 727 to about 470 of SEQ ID NO 27 as determined using the algorithm described by D. T and P. A. J. PNAS 99 6 3740 5 2002 .

Recent evidence suggests the pattern of DNA methylation at CpG islands around promoter regions are often altered in cancer cells and that a correlation can be established between hyper methylation within a promoter and lack of gene expression Baylin et al. 2001 . The silencing of gene expression is due to the recruitment of histone deacetylase to the methylated DNA. This can have the same effect as other types of tumor suppressor gene inactivation such as loss of homozygosity. The BGS 42 promotor region does indeed possess potential CpG beginning at positions 727 1232 and 1968 relative to the ATG at 1. The altered methylation patterns within these regions might be operating to decrease the transcriptional activity at the BGS42 locus and hence decrease the steady state RNA levels in proliferative tissues. The latter mechanism could explain the observed decrease in BGS 42 expression in lung and testis tumor tissues.

Therefore the upstream non coding promoter sequence of the BGS 42 gene from 2057 to 1 SEQ ID NO 27 is useful for decreasing the expression of a gene sequence in cells particularly proliferative cells when located upstream of a gene in a vector sequence. Alternatively the location of one or more of th CpG islands identified in the BGS 42 promoter sequence are useful for decreasing the expression of a gene sequence in cells particularly proliferative cells when located upstream of a gene in a vector sequence.

The identification of three CpG islands within the BGS 42 promoter sequence in combination with the observed decrease in BGS 42 expression in proliferative tissues suggests a role for BGS42 in the etiology of human cancers and that biological and pharmaceutical approaches to replacing BGS 42 function which include for example the alteration of DNA methylation patterns within the BGS 42 promoter e.g. deletion or alteration of CpG islands in the BGs 42 promoter to decrease the level of methylation and or the inhibition of histone deacetylase recruitment may represent a powerful new strategy for slowing tumor progression. Genomic scale approaches to finding other genes that upon inhibition restore BGS 42 expression and small molecule inhibitors to those gene products may have utility in the treatment of testicular and or lung cancers. In addition monitoring the attenuation of BGS42 gene expression may also provide a marker for tumor aggressiveness and have predictive value in determining therapeutic approaches.

The BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention including agonists and or fragments thereof have uses that include modulating cellular proliferation and or differentiation activity in various cells tissues and organisms and particularly in mammalian testis lymph node pituitary placenta and or vas deferens cells and tissues preferably human tissue.

The strong homology to human tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins combined with the predominate localized expression in vas deferens testis tissue suggests the potential utility for BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides in treating diagnosing prognosing and or preventing testicular in addition to reproductive disorders.

In preferred embodiments BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides including agonists and fragments thereof have uses which include treating diagnosing prognosing and or preventing the following non limiting diseases or disorders of the testis spermatogenesis infertility Klinefelter s syndrome XX male epididymitis genital warts germinal cell aplasia cryptorchidism varicocele immotile cilia syndrome and viral orchitis. The BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides including agonists and fragments thereof may also have uses related to modulating testicular development embryogenesis reproduction and in ameliorating treating and or preventing testicular proliferative disorders e.g. cancers which include for example choriocarcinoma Nonseminoma seminona and testicular germ cell tumors .

Likewise the predominate localized expression in testis tissue also emphasizes the potential utility for BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides in treating diagnosing prognosing and or preventing metabolic diseases and disorders which include the following not limiting examples premature puberty incomplete puberty Kallman syndrome Cushing s syndrome hyperprolactinemia hemochromatosis congenital adrenal hyperplasia FSH deficiency and granulomatous disease for example.

This gene product may also be useful in assays designed to identify binding agents as such agents antagonists are useful as male contraceptive agents. The testes are also a site of active gene expression of transcripts that is expressed particularly at low levels in other tissues of the body. Therefore this gene product may be expressed in other specific tissues or organs where it may play related functional roles in other processes such as hematopoiesis inflammation bone formation and kidney function to name a few possible target indications.

The observed loss of BGS 42 expression in testis tumors relative to normal testis tissue suggests loss of the BGS 42 polypeptide may play a critical role in the development of a transformed phenotype leading to the development of cancers and or a proliferative condition either directly or indirectly. Alternatively the loss of BGS 42 polypeptide expression may play a protective role and could be down regulated in response to a cancerous or proliferative phenotype e.g. as a component of cell cycle regulation to inhibit further cellular damage that may be caused by proliferation . Whether loss of BGS 42 plays a role in directing transformation or plays the role of protecting cells in response to a transformed phenotype its role in testis tumors is likely to be enhanced. Therefore agonists of the BGS 42 polypeptide may be useful in the treatment amelioration and or prevention of a variety of proliferative conditions including but not limited to testis in addition to other cancers or proliferative conditions.

The strong homology to human tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins combined with the localized expression in lung tissue suggests the BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides may be useful in treating diagnosing prognosing and or preventing pulmonary diseases and disorders which include the following not limiting examples ARDS emphysema cystic fibrosis interstitial lung disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease bronchitis lymphangioleiomyomatosis pneumonitis eosinophilic pneumonias granulomatosis pulmonary infarction pulmonary fibrosis pneumoconiosis alveolar hemorrhage neoplasms lung abscesses empyema and increased susceptibility to lung infections e.g. immumocompromised HIV etc. for example.

Moreover polynucleotides and polypeptides including fragments and or antagonists thereof have uses which include directly or indirectly treating preventing diagnosing and or prognosing the following non limiting pulmonary infections pnemonia bacterial pnemonia viral pnemonia for example as caused by Influenza virus Respiratory syncytial virus Parainfluenza virus Adenovirus Coxsackievirus Cytomegalovirus Herpes simplex virus Hantavirus etc. mycobacteria pnemonia for example as caused by etc. mycoplasma pnemonia fungal pnemonia for example as caused by sp. sp. Zygomycetes etc. Legionnaires Disease pnemonia aspiration pnemonia sp. Infections parasitic pnemonia for example as caused by Strongyloides etc. necrotizing pnemonia in addition to any other pulmonary disease and or disorder e.g. non pneumonia implicated by the causative agents listed above or elsewhere herein.

The observed loss of BGS 42 expression in lung tumors relative to normal lung tissue suggests loss of the BGS 42 polypeptide may play a critical role in the development of a transformed phenotype leading to the development of cancers and or a proliferative condition either directly or indirectly. Alternatively the loss of BGS 42 polypeptide expression may play a protective role and could be down regulated in response to a cancerous or proliferative phenotype e.g. as a component of cell cycle regulation to inhibit further cellular damage that may be caused by proliferation . Whether loss of BGS 42 plays a role in directing transformation or plays the role of protecting cells in response to a transformed phenotype its role in lung tumors is likely to be enhanced. Therefore agonists of the BGS 42 polypeptide may be useful in the treatment amelioration and or prevention of a variety of proliferative conditions including but not limited to lung in addition to other cancers or proliferative conditions.

The strong homology to human tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins combined with the predominate localized expression in lymph node tissue suggests the BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides may be useful in treating diagnosing prognosing and or preventing immune diseases and or disorders. Representative uses are described in the Immune Activity and Infectious Disease sections below and elsewhere herein. Briefly the strong expression in immune tissue indicates a role in regulating the proliferation survival differentiation and or activation of hematopoietic cell lineages including blood stem cells.

The BGS 42 polypeptide may also be useful as a preventative agent for immunological disorders including arthritis asthma immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS leukemia rheumatoid arthritis granulomatous disease inflammatory bowel disease sepsis acne neutropenia neutrophilia psoriasis hypersensitivities such as T cell mediated cytotoxicity immune reactions to transplanted organs and tissues such as host versus graft and graft versus host diseases or autoimmunity disorders such as autoimmune infertility lense tissue injury demyelination systemic lupus erythematosis drug induced hemolytic anemia rheumatoid arthritis Sjogren s disease and scleroderma. The BGS 42 polypeptide may be useful for modulating cytokine production antigen presentation or other processes such as for boosting immune responses etc.

Moreover the protein may represent a secreted factor that influences the differentiation or behavior of other blood cells or that recruits hematopoietic cells to sites of injury. Thus this gene product is thought to be useful in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages and in the differentiation and or proliferation of various cell types. Furthermore the protein may also be used to determine biological activity raise antibodies as tissuemarkers to isolate cognate ligands or receptors to identify agents that modulate their interactions in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein as well as antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.

The strong homology to human tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins combined with the localized expression in pituitary gland tissue suggests the BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides may be useful in treating diagnosing prognosing and or preventing endocrine diseases and or disorders which include but are not limited to the following aberrant growth hormone synthesis and or secretion aberrant prolactin synthesis and or secretion aberrant luteinizing hormone synthesis and or secretion aberrant follicle stimulating hormone synthesis and or secretion aberrant thyroid stimulating hormone synthesis and or secretion aberrant adrenocorticotropin synthesis and or secretion aberrant vasopressin secretion aberrant oxytocin secretion aberrant growth aberrant lactation aberrant sexual characteristic development aberrant testosterone synthesis and or secretion aberrant estrogen synthesis and or secretion aberrant water homeostasis hypogonadism Addison s disease hypothyroidism Cushing s disease agromegaly gigantism lethargy osteoporosis aberrant calcium homeostasis aberrant potassium homeostasis reproductive disorders and developmental disorders.

The strong homology to human tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins combined with the localized expression in placenta tissue suggests the BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides may be useful in treating diagnosing prognosing and or preventing female reproductive diseases and or disorders particularly pre term labor.

The BGS 42 polypeptide may also be useful as a preventative agent for immunological disorders including arthritis asthma immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS leukemia rheumatoid arthritis granulomatous disease inflammatory bowel disease sepsis acne neutropenia neutrophilia psoriasis hypersensitivities such as T cell mediated cytotoxicity immune reactions to transplanted organs and tissues such as host versus graft and graft versus host diseases or autoimmunity disorders such as autoimmune infertility lense tissue injury demyelination systemic lupus erythematosis drug induced hemolytic anemia rheumatoid arthritis Sjogren s disease and scleroderma. The BGS 42 polypeptide may be useful for modulating cytokine production antigen presentation or other processes such as for boosting immune responses etc.

Moreover BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides including fragments and agonists thereof may have uses which include treating diagnosing prognosing and or preventing hyperproliferative disorders particularly of the reproductive immune endocrine and metabolic system. Such disorders may include for example cancers and metastasis.

The BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides including fragments and or antagonsists thereof may have uses which include identification of modulators of BGS 42 function including antibodies for detection or neutralization naturally occurring modulators and small molecule modulators. Antibodies to domains of the BGS 42 protein could be used as diagnostic agents of reproductive and inflammatory conditions in patients are useful in monitoring the activation of signal transduction pathways and can be used as a biomarker for the involvement of tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins in disease states and in the evaluation of agonists of tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins in vivo.

BGS 42 polypeptides and polynucleotides have additional uses which include diagnosing diseases related to the over and or under expression of BGS 42 by identifying mutations in the BGS 42 gene by using BGS 42 sequences as probes or by determining BGS 42 protein or mRNA expression levels. BGS 42 polypeptides may be useful for screening compounds that affect the activity of the protein. BGS 42 peptides can also be used for the generation of specific antibodies and as bait in yeast two hybrid screens to find proteins the specifically interact with BGS 42 described elsewhere herein .

Although it is believed the encoded polypeptide may share at least some biological activities with tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins a number of methods of determining the exact biological function of this clone are either known in the art or are described elsewhere herein. Briefly the function of this clone may be determined by applying microarray methodology. Nucleic acids corresponding to the BGS 42 polynucleotides in addition to other clones of the present invention may be arrayed on microchips for expression profiling. Depending on which polynucleotide probe is used to hybridize to the slides a change in expression of a specific gene may provide additional insight into the function of this gene based upon the conditions being studied. For example an observed increase or decrease in expression levels when the polynucleotide probe used comes from diseased testis cells or tissue as compared to normal tissue might indicate a function in modulating reproductive function for example. In the case of BGS 42 testis lymph node pituitary gland and or placenta tissue should be used for example to extract RNA to prepare the probe.

In addition the function of the protein may be assessed by applying quantitative PCR methodology for example. Real time quantitative PCR would provide the capability of following the expression of the BGS 42 gene throughout development for example. Quantitative PCR methodology requires only a nominal amount of tissue from each developmentally important step is needed to perform such experiments. Therefore the application of quantitative PCR methodology to refining the biological function of this polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention. In the case of BGS 42 a disease correlation related to BGS 42 may be made by comparing the mRNA expression level of BGS 42 in normal tissue as compared to diseased tissue particularly diseased tissue isolated from the following testis lymph node pituitary gland and or placenta tissue . Significantly higher or lower levels of BGS 42 expression in the diseased tissue may suggest BGS 42 plays a role in disease progression and antagonists against BGS 42 polypeptides would be useful therapeutically in treating preventing and or ameliorating the disease. Alternatively significantly higher or lower levels of BGS 42 expression in the diseased tissue may suggest BGS 42 plays a defensive role against disease progression and agonists of BGS 42 polypeptides may be useful therapeutically in treating preventing and or ameliorating the disease. Also encompassed by the present invention are quantitative PCR probes corresponding to the polynucleotide sequence provided as SEQ ID NO 1 .

The function of the protein may also be assessed through complementation assays in yeast. For example in the case of the BGS 42 transforming yeast deficient in tubulin tyrosine ligase activity for example and assessing their ability to grow would provide convincing evidence the BGS 42 polypeptide has tubulin tyrosine ligase activity. Additional assay conditions and methods that may be used in assessing the function of the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention are known in the art some of which are disclosed elsewhere herein.

Alternatively the biological function of the encoded polypeptide may be determined by disrupting a homologue of this polypeptide in Mice and or rats and observing the resulting phenotype. Such knock out experiments are known in the art some of which are disclosed elsewhere herein.

Moreover the biological function of this polypeptide may be determined by the application of antisense and or sense methodology and the resulting generation of transgenic mice and or rats. Expressing a particular gene in either sense or antisense orientation in a transgenic mouse or rat could lead to respectively higher or lower expression levels of that particular gene. Altering the endogenous expression levels of a gene can lead to the observation of a particular phenotype that can then be used to derive indications on the function of the gene. The gene can be either over expressed or under expressed in every cell of the organism at all times using a strong ubiquitous promoter or it could be expressed in one or more discrete parts of the organism using a well characterized tissue specific promoter e.g. tubulin tyrosine ligase tissue specific promoter or it can be expressed at a specified time of development using an inducible and or a developmentally regulated promoter.

In the case of BGS 42 transgenic mice or rats if no phenotype is apparent in normal growth conditions observing the organism under diseased conditions reproductive immune endocrine and metabolic disorders in addition to cancers etc. may lead to understanding the function of the gene. Therefore the application of antisense and or sense methodology to the creation of transgenic mice or rats to refine the biological function of the polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention.

The BGS 42 polypeptides of the present invention were determined to comprise several phosphorylation sites based upon the Motif algorithm Genetics Computer Group Inc. . The phosphorylation of such sites may regulate some biological activity of the BGS 42 polypeptide. For example phosphorylation at specific sites may be involved in regulating the proteins ability to associate or bind to other molecules e.g. proteins ligands substrates DNA etc. . In the present case phosphorylation may modulate the ability of the BGS 42 polypeptide to associate with other polypeptides particularly cognate ligand for BGS 42 or its ability to modulate certain cellular signal pathways.

The BGS 42 polypeptide was predicted to comprise seven PKC phosphorylation sites using the Motif algorithm Genetics Computer Group Inc. . In vivo protein kinase C exhibits a preference for the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues. The PKC phosphorylation sites have the following consensus pattern ST x RK where S or T represents the site of phosphorylation and x an intervening amino acid residue. Additional information regarding PKC phosphorylation sites can be found in Woodget J. R. Gould K. L. Hunter T. Eur. J. Biochem. 161 177 184 1986 and Kishimoto A. Nishiyama K. Nakanishi H. Uratsuji Y.

The BGS 42 polypeptide was predicted to comprise seven casein kinase II phosphorylation sites using the Motif algorithm Genetics Computer Group Inc. . Casein kinase II CK 2 is a protein serine threonine kinase whose activity is independent of cyclic nucleotides and calcium. CK 2 phosphorylates many different proteins. The substrate specificity 1 of this enzyme can be summarized as follows 1 Under comparable conditions Ser is favored over Thr. 2 An acidic residue either Asp or Glu must be present three residues from the C terminal of the phosphate acceptor site 3 Additional acidic residues in positions 1 2 4 and 5 increase the phosphorylation rate. Most physiological substrates have at least one acidic residue in these positions 4 Asp is preferred to Glu as the provider of acidic determinants and 5 A basic residue at the N terminal of the acceptor site decreases the phosphorylation rate while an acidic one will increase it.

A consensus pattern for casein kinase II phosphorylations site is as follows ST x 2 DE wherein x represents any amino acid and S or T is the phosphorylation site.

The PMN29 polypeptide was predicted to comprise six N myristoylation sites using the Motif algorithm Genetics Computer Group Inc. . An appreciable number of eukaryotic proteins are acylated by the covalent addition of myristate a C14 saturated fatty acid to their N terminal residue via an amide linkage. The sequence specificity of the enzyme responsible for this modification myristoyl CoA protein N myristoyl transferase NMT has been derived from the sequence of known N myristoylated proteins and from studies using synthetic peptides. The specificity seems to be the following i. The N terminal residue must be glycine ii. In position 2 uncharged residues are allowed iii. Charged residues proline and large hydrophobic residues are not allowed iv. In positions 3 and 4 most if not all residues are allowed v. In position 5 small uncharged residues are allowed Ala Ser Thr Cys Asn and Gly . Serine is favored and vi. In position 6 proline is not allowed.

A consensus pattern for N myristoylation is as follows G EDRKHPFYW x 2 STAGCN P wherein x represents any amino acid and G is the N myristoylation site.

Additional information specific to N myristoylation sites may be found in reference to the following publication Towler D. A. Gordon J. I. Adams S. P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 57 69 99 1988 and Grand R. J. A. Biochem. J. 258 625 638 1989 which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety.

In preferred embodiments the following N myristoylation site polypeptides are encompassed by the present invention QRQGRGAVWGSVIYPS SEQ ID NO 46 PPPFSGSDLCVAGVSV SEQ ID NO 47 LKEEKGLPLALLAPLR SEQ ID NO 48 LAPLRGAAESGGAAQP SEQ ID NO 49 QAPNTGVPVAQPAKSW SEQ ID NO 50 and or EPVLRGLKTAEGALRP SEQ ID NO 51 . Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also provided.

The present invention encompasses the identification of compounds and drugs which stimulate BGS 42 on the one hand i.e. agonists and which inhibit the function of BGS 42 on the other hand i.e. antagonists . In general such screening procedures involve providing appropriate cells which express the polypeptide of the present invention on the surface thereof. Such cells may include for example cells from mammals yeast or . In a preferred embodiment a polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of the present invention may be employed to transfect cells to thereby express the BGS 42 polypeptide. The expressed polypeptide may then be contacted with a test compound to observe binding stimulation or inhibition of a functional response.

Many polynucleotide sequences such as EST sequences are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO 1 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence would be cumbersome. Accordingly preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides consisting of a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a b where a is any integer between 1 to 1824 of SEQ ID NO 1 b is an integer between 15 to 1838 where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO 1 and where b is greater than or equal to a 14.

In one embodiment a BGS 42 polypeptide comprises a portion of the amino sequence depicted in . In another embodiment a BGS 42 polypeptide comprises at least 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 or 20 amino acids of the amino sequence depicted in . In further embodiments the following BGS 42 polypeptide fragments are specifically excluded from the present invention KWVVQKYIE SEQ ID NO 15 RQWFLVTDWNPLT SEQ ID NO 16 SFELYGADFV SEQ ID NO 17 QWFLVTDWNPLT SEQ ID NO 18 NIWIIKPAAKSRGRDIVCMDRVE SEQ ID NO 19 DNKWVVQKYIETP SEQ ID NO 20 DTKFDIRQWFLVTDWNPLTIWFYKESYLRFSTQRFSLDKLDSAIHLCNN SEQ ID NO 21 SSPTMHPSTPVTAQLCAQVQEDTIKV SEQ ID NO 22 CDIGNFELLWRQP SEQ ID NO 23 LPACPCRHVDSQAPNTGVPVAQPAKSWDPNQLNAHPLEPVLR SEQ ID NO 24 and or LKTAEGALRPPPGGKGS SEQ ID NO 25 .

Table I summarizes the information corresponding to each Gene No. described above. The nucleotide sequence identified as NT SEQ ID NO X was assembled from partially homologous overlapping sequences obtained from the cDNA clone ID identified in Table I and in some cases from additional related DNA clones. The overlapping sequences were assembled into a single contiguous sequence of high redundancy usually several overlapping sequences at each nucleotide position resulting in a final sequence identified as SEQ ID NO X.

The cDNA Clone ID was deposited on the date and given the corresponding deposit number listed in ATCC Deposit No 4454. Vector refers to the type of vector contained in the cDNA Clone ID.

 Total NT Seq. Of Clone refers to the total number of nucleotides in the clone contig identified by Gene No. The deposited clone may contain all or most of the sequence of SEQ ID NO X. The nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO X of the putative start codon methionine is identified as 5 NT of Start Codon of ORF. 

The translated amino acid sequence beginning with the methionine is identified as AA SEQ ID NO Y although other reading frames can also be easily translated using known molecular biology techniques. The polypeptides produced by these alternative open reading frames are specifically contemplated by the present invention.

The total number of amino acids within the open reading frame of SEQ ID NO Y is identified as Total AA of ORF .

SEQ ID NO X where X may be any of the polynucleotide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing and the translated SEQ ID NO Y where Y may be any of the polypeptide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing are sufficiently accurate and otherwise suitable for a variety of uses well known in the art and described further herein. For instance SEQ ID NO X is useful for designing nucleic acid hybridization probes that will detect nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID NO X or the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. These probes will also hybridize to nucleic acid molecules in biological samples thereby enabling a variety of forensic and diagnostic methods of the invention. Similarly polypeptides identified from SEQ ID NO Y may be used for example to generate antibodies which bind specifically to proteins containing the polypeptides and the proteins encoded by the cDNA clones identified in Table I.

Nevertheless DNA sequences generated by sequencing reactions can contain sequencing errors. The errors exist as misidentified nucleotides or as insertions or deletions of nucleotides in the generated DNA sequence. The erroneously inserted or deleted nucleotides may cause frame shifts in the reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequence. In these cases the predicted amino acid sequence diverges from the actual amino acid sequence even though the generated DNA sequence may be greater than 99.9 identical to the actual DNA sequence for example one base insertion or deletion in an open reading frame of over 1000 bases .

Accordingly for those applications requiring precision in the nucleotide sequence or the amino acid sequence the present invention provides not only the generated nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO 1 and the predicted translated amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO 2 but also a sample of plasmid DNA containing a cDNA of the invention deposited with the ATCC as set forth in Table I. The nucleotide sequence of each deposited clone can readily be determined by sequencing the deposited clone in accordance with known methods. The predicted amino acid sequence can then be verified from such deposits. Moreover the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by a particular clone can also be directly determined by peptide sequencing or by expressing the protein in a suitable host cell containing the deposited cDNA collecting the protein and determining its sequence.

The present invention also relates to the genes corresponding to SEQ ID NO 1 SEQ ID NO 2 or the deposited clone. The corresponding gene can be isolated in accordance with known methods using the sequence information disclosed herein. Such methods include preparing probes or primers from the disclosed sequence and identifying or amplifying the corresponding gene from appropriate sources of genomic material.

Also provided in the present invention are species homologs allelic variants and or orthologs. The skilled artisan could using procedures well known in the art obtain the polynucleotide sequence corresponding to full length genes including but not limited to the full length coding region allelic variants splice variants orthologs and or species homologues of genes corresponding to SEQ ID NO 1 SEQ ID NO 2 or a deposited clone relying on the sequence from the sequences disclosed herein or the clones deposited with the ATCC . For example allelic variants and or species homologues may be isolated and identified by making suitable probes or primers which correspond to the 5 3 or internal regions of the sequences provided herein and screening a suitable nucleic acid source for allelic variants and or the desired homologue.

The polypeptides of the invention can be prepared in any suitable manner. Such polypeptides include isolated naturally occurring polypeptides recombinantly produced polypeptides synthetically produced polypeptides or polypeptides produced by a combination of these methods. Means for preparing such polypeptides are well understood in the art.

The polypeptides may be in the form of the protein or may be a part of a larger protein such as a fusion protein see below . It is often advantageous to include an additional amino acid sequence which contains secretory or leader sequences pro sequences sequences which aid in purification such as multiple histidine residues or an additional sequence for stability during recombinant production.

The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably provided in an isolated form and preferably are substantially purified. A recombinantly produced version of a polypeptide can be substantially purified using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art such as for example by the one step method described in Smith and Johnson Gene 67 31 40 1988 . Polypeptides of the invention also can be purified from natural synthetic or recombinant sources using protocols described herein or otherwise known in the art such as for example antibodies of the invention raised against the full length form of the protein.

The present invention is also directed to nucleic acid molecules which comprise or alternatively consist of a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 99.1 99.2 99.3 99.4 99.5 99.6 99.7 99.8 or 99.9 identical to for example any of the nucleotide sequences in a b c d e f g or h above.

The present invention encompasses polypeptide sequences which comprise or alternatively consist of an amino acid sequence which is at least about 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 99.1 99.2 99.3 99.4 99.5 99.6 99.7 99.8 or 99.9 identical to the following non limited examples the polypeptide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO 2 the polypeptide sequence encoded by a cDNA provided in the deposited clone and or polypeptide fragments of any of the polypeptides provided herein.

In another embodiment the invention encompasses nucleic acid molecules which comprise or alternatively consist of a polynucleotide which hybridizes under stringent conditions or alternatively under lower stringency conditions to a polynucleotide in a b c d e f g or h above.

The present invention is also directed to polypeptides which comprise or alternatively consist of an amino acid sequence which is at least about 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 99.1 99.2 99.3 99.4 99.5 99.6 99.7 99.8 or 99.9 identical to for example the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence in SEQ ID NO 1 a polypeptide sequence encoded by the cDNA in cDNA plasmid Z and or polypeptide fragments of any of these polypeptides e.g. those fragments described herein .

By a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least for example 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence of the present invention it is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid is identical to the reference sequence except that the nucleotide sequence may include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. In other words to obtain a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence up to 5 of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide or a number of nucleotides up to 5 of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. The query sequence may be an entire sequence referenced in Table I the ORF open reading frame or any fragment specified as described herein.

As a practical matter whether any particular nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is at least about 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 99.1 99.2 99.3 99.4 99.5 99.6 99.7 99.8 or 99.9 identical to a nucleotide sequence of the present invention can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence a sequence of the present invention and a subject sequence also referred to as a global sequence alignment can be determined using the CLUSTALW computer program Thompson J. D. et al. Nucleic Acids Research 2 22 4673 4680 1994 which is based on the algorithm of Higgins D. G. et al. Computer Applications in the Biosciences CABIOS 8 2 189 191 1992 . In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both DNA sequences. An RNA sequence can be compared by converting U s to T s. However the CLUSTALW algorithm automatically converts U s to T s when comparing RNA sequences to DNA sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a CLUSTALW alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity via pairwise alignments are Matrix IUB k tuple 1 Number of Top Diagonals 5 Gap Penalty 3 Gap Open Penalty 10 Gap Extension Penalty 0.1 Scoring Method Percent Window Size 5 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence whichever is shorter. For multiple alignments the following CLUSTALW parameters are preferred Gap Opening Penalty 10 Gap Extension Parameter 0.05 Gap Separation Penalty Range 8 End Gap Separation Penalty Off Identity for Alignment Delay 40 Residue Specific Gaps Off Hydrophilic Residue Gap Off and Transition Weighting 0. The pairwise and multple alignment parameters provided for CLUSTALW above represent the default parameters as provided with the ALIGNX software program Vector NTI suite of programs version 6.0 .

The present invention encompasses the application of a manual correction to the percent identity results in the instance where the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5 or 3 deletions not because of internal deletions. If only the local pairwise percent identity is required no manual correction is needed. However a manual correction may be applied to determine the global percent identity from a global polynucleotide alignment. Percent identity calculations based upon global polynucleotide alignments are often preferred since they reflect the percent identity between the polynucleotide molecules as a whole i.e. including any polynucleotide overhangs not just overlapping regions as opposed to only local matching polynucleotides. Manual corrections for global percent identity determinations are required since the CLUSTALW program does not account for 5 and 3 truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5 or 3 ends relative to the query sequence the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5 and 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched aligned is determined by results of the CLUSTALW sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity calculated by the above CLUSTALW program using the specified parameters to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score may be used for the purposes of the present invention. Only bases outside the 5 and 3 bases of the subject sequence as displayed by the CLUSTALW alignment which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score.

For example a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5 end of the subject sequence and therefore the CLUSTALW alignment does not show a matched alignment of the first 10 bases at 5 end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10 of the sequence number of bases at the 5 and 3 ends not matched total number of bases in the query sequence so 10 is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the CLUSTALW program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90 . In another example a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5 or 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by CLUSTALW is not manually corrected. Once again only bases 5 and 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are required for the purposes of the present invention.

By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least for example 95 identical to a query amino acid sequence of the present invention it is intended that the amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95 identical to a query amino acid sequence up to 5 of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted deleted or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.

As a practical matter whether any particular polypeptide is at least about 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 99.1 99.2 99.3 99.4 99.5 99.6 99.7 99.8 or 99.9 identical to for instance an amino acid sequence referenced in Table 1 SEQ ID NO 2 or to the amino acid sequence encoded by cDNA contained in a deposited clone can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence a sequence of the present invention and a subject sequence also referred to as a global sequence alignment can be determined using the CLUSTALW computer program Thompson J. D. et al. Nucleic Acids Research 2 22 4673 4680 1994 which is based on the algorithm of Higgins D. G. et al. Computer Applications in the Biosciences CABIOS 8 2 189 191 1992 . In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both amino acid sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a CLUSTALW alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity via pairwise alignments are Matrix BLOSUM k tuple 1 Number of Top Diagonals 5 Gap Penalty 3 Gap Open Penalty 10 Gap Extension Penalty 0.1 Scoring Method Percent Window Size 5 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence whichever is shorter. For multiple alignments the following CLUSTALW parameters are preferred Gap Opening Penalty 10 Gap Extension Parameter 0.05 Gap Separation Penalty Range 8 End Gap Separation Penalty Off Identity for Alignment Delay 40 Residue Specific Gaps Off Hydrophilic Residue Gap Off and Transition Weighting 0. The pairwise and multiple alignment parameters provided for CLUSTALW above represent the default parameters as provided with the ALIGNX software program Vector NTI suite of programs version 6.0 .

The present invention encompasses the application of a manual correction to the percent identity results in the instance where the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of N or C terminal deletions not because of internal deletions. If only the local pairwise percent identity is required no manual correction is needed. However a manual correction may be applied to determine the global percent identity from a global polypeptide alignment. Percent identity calculations based upon global polypeptide alignments are often preferred since they reflect the percent identity between the polypeptide molecules as a whole i.e. including any polypeptide overhangs not just overlapping regions as opposed to only local matching polypeptides. Manual corrections for global percent identity determinations are required since the CLUSTALW program does not account for N and C terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N and C termini relative to the query sequence the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N and C terminal of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with a corresponding subject residue as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched aligned is determined by results of the CLUSTALW sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity calculated by the above CLUSTALW program using the specified parameters to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what may be used for the purposes of the present invention. Only residues to the N and C termini of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is only query residue positions outside the farthest N and C terminal residues of the subject sequence.

For example a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N terminus of the subject sequence and therefore the CLUSTALW alignment does not show a matching alignment of the first 10 residues at the N terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10 of the sequence number of residues at the N and C termini not matched total number of residues in the query sequence so 10 is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the CLUSTALW program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90 . In another example a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N or C termini of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by CLUSTALW is not manually corrected. Once again only residue positions outside the N and C terminal ends of the subject sequence as displayed in the CLUSTALW alignment which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are required for the purposes of the present invention.

In addition to the above method of aligning two or more polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences to arrive at a percent identity value for the aligned sequences it may be desirable in some circumstances to use a modified version of the CLUSTALW algorithm which takes into account known structural features of the sequences to be aligned such as for example the SWISS PROT designations for each sequence. The result of such a modified CLUSTALW algorithm may provide a more accurate value of the percent identity for two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences. Support for such a modified version of CLUSTALW is provided within the CLUSTALW algorithm and would be readily appreciated to one of skill in the art of bioinformatics.

The variants may contain alterations in the coding regions non coding regions or both. Especially preferred are polynucleotide variants containing alterations which produce silent substitutions additions or deletions but do not alter the properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide. Nucleotide variants produced by silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code are preferred. Moreover variants in which 5 10 1 5 or 1 2 amino acids are substituted deleted or added in any combination are also preferred. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons e.g. to optimize codon expression for a particular host change codons in the mRNA to those preferred by a bacterial host such as .

Naturally occurring variants are called allelic variants and refer to one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism. Genes II Lewin B. ed. John Wiley Sons New York 1985 . These allelic variants can vary at either the polynucleotide and or polypeptide level and are included in the present invention. Alternatively non naturally occurring variants may be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.

Using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology variants may be generated to improve or alter the characteristics of the polypeptides of the present invention. For instance one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N terminus or C terminus of the protein without substantial loss of biological function. The authors of Ron et al. J. Biol. Chem. 268 2984 2988 1993 reported variant KGF proteins having heparin binding activity even after deleting 3 8 or 27 amino terminal amino acid residues. Similarly Interferon gamma exhibited up to ten times higher activity after deleting 8 10 amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of this protein Dobeli et al. J. Biotechnology 7 199 216 1988 .

Moreover ample evidence demonstrates that variants often retain a biological activity similar to that of the naturally occurring protein. For example Gayle and coworkers J. Biol. Chem . . . 268 22105 22111 1993 conducted extensive mutational analysis of human cytokine IL 1a. They used random mutagenesis to generate over 3 500 individual IL 1a mutants that averaged 2.5 amino acid changes per variant over the entire length of the molecule. Multiple mutations were examined at every possible amino acid position. The investigators found that m ost of the molecule could be altered with little effect on either binding or biological activity . In fact only 23 unique amino acid sequences out of more than 3 500 nucleotide sequences examined produced a protein that significantly differed in activity from wild type.

Furthermore even if deleting one or more amino acids from the N terminus or C terminus of a polypeptide results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions other biological activities may still be retained. For example the ability of a deletion variant to induce and or to bind antibodies which recognize the protein will likely be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the protein are removed from the N terminus or C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N or C terminal residues of a protein retains such immunogenic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.

Alternatively such N terminus or C terminus deletions of a polypeptide of the present invention may in fact result in a significant increase in one or more of the biological activities of the polypeptide s . For example biological activity of many polypeptides are governed by the presence of regulatory domains at either one or both termini. Such regulatory domains effectively inhibit the biological activity of such polypeptides in lieu of an activation event e.g. binding to a cognate ligand or receptor phosphorylation proteolytic processing etc. . Thus by eliminating the regulatory domain of a polypeptide the polypeptide may effectively be rendered biologically active in the absence of an activation event.

Thus the invention further includes polypeptide variants that show substantial biological activity. Such variants include deletions insertions inversions repeats and substitutions selected according to general rules known in the art so as have little effect on activity. For example guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie et al. Science 247 1306 1310 1990 wherein the authors indicate that there are two main strategies for studying the tolerance of an amino acid sequence to change.

The first strategy exploits the tolerance of amino acid substitutions by natural selection during the process of evolution. By comparing amino acid sequences in different species conserved amino acids can be identified. These conserved amino acids are likely important for protein function. In contrast the amino acid positions where substitutions have been tolerated by natural selection indicates that these positions are not critical for protein function. Thus positions tolerating amino acid substitution could be modified while still maintaining biological activity of the protein.

The second strategy uses genetic engineering to introduce amino acid changes at specific positions of a cloned gene to identify regions critical for protein function. For example site directed mutagenesis or alanine scanning mutagenesis introduction of single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule can be used. Cunningham and Wells Science 244 1081 1085 1989 . The resulting mutant molecules can then be tested for biological activity.

As the authors state these two strategies have revealed that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions. The authors further indicate which amino acid changes are likely to be permissive at certain amino acid positions in the protein. For example most buried within the tertiary structure of the protein amino acid residues require nonpolar side chains whereas few features of surface side chains are generally conserved.

The invention encompasses polypeptides having a lower degree of identity but having sufficient similarity so as to perform one or more of the same functions performed by the polypeptide of the present invention. Similarity is determined by conserved amino acid substitution. Such substitutions are those that substitute a given amino acid in a polypeptide by another amino acid of like characteristics e.g. chemical properties . According to Cunningham et al above such conservative substitutions are likely to be phenotypically silent. Additional guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent are found in Bowie et al. Science 247 1306 1310 1990 .

Tolerated conservative amino acid substitutions of the present invention involve replacement of the aliphatic or hydrophobic amino acids Ala Val Leu and Ile replacement of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr replacement of the acidic residues Asp and Glu replacement of the amide residues Asn and Gln replacement of the basic residues Lys Arg and H is replacement of the aromatic residues Phe Tyr and Trp and replacement of the small sized amino acids Ala Ser Thr Met and Gly.

In addition the present invention also encompasses the conservative substitutions provided in Table III below.

Aside from the uses described above such amino acid substitutions may also increase protein or peptide stability. The invention encompasses amino acid substitutions that contain for example one or more non peptide bonds which replace the peptide bonds in the protein or peptide sequence. Also included are substitutions that include amino acid residues other than naturally occurring L amino acids e.g. D amino acids or non naturally occurring or synthetic amino acids e.g. or amino acids.

Both identity and similarity can be readily calculated by reference to the following publications Computational Molecular Biology Lesk A. M. ed. Oxford University Press New York 1988 Biocomputing Informatics and Genome Projects Smith D. W. ed. Academic Press New York 1993 Informatics Computer Analysis of Sequence Data Part 1 Griffin A. M. and Griffin H. G. eds. Humana Press New Jersey 1994 Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology von Heinje G. Academic Press 1987 and Sequence Analysis Primer Gribskov M. and Devereux J. eds. M Stockton Press New York 1991.

In addition the present invention also encompasses substitution of amino acids based upon the probability of an amino acid substitution resulting in conservation of function. Such probabilities are determined by aligning multiple genes with related function and assessing the relative penalty of each substitution to proper gene function. Such probabilities are often described in a matrix and are used by some algorithms e.g. BLAST CLUSTALW GAP etc. in calculating percent similarity wherein similarity refers to the degree by which one amino acid may substitute for another amino acid without lose of function. An example of such a matrix is the PAM250 or BLOSUM62 matrix.

Aside from the canonical chemically conservative substitutions referenced above the invention also encompasses substitutions which are typically not classified as conservative but that may be chemically conservative under certain circumstances. Analysis of enzymatic catalysis for proteases for example has shown that certain amino acids within the active site of some enzymes may have highly perturbed pKa s due to the unique microenvironment of the active site. Such perturbed pKa s could enable some amino acids to substitute for other amino acids while conserving enzymatic structure and function. Examples of amino acids that are known to have amino acids with perturbed pKa s are the Glu 35 residue of Lysozyme the Ile 16 residue of Chymotrypsin the His 159 residue of Papain etc. The conservation of function relates to either anomalous protonation or anomalous deprotonation of such amino acids relative to their canonical non perturbed pKa. The pKa perturbation may enable these amino acids to actively participate in general acid base catalysis due to the unique ionization environment within the enzyme active site. Thus substituting an amino acid capable of serving as either a general acid or general base within the microenvironment of an enzyme active site or cavity as may be the case in the same or similar capacity as the wild type amino acid would effectively serve as a conservative amino substitution.

Besides conservative amino acid substitution variants of the present invention include but are not limited to the following i substitutions with one or more of the non conserved amino acid residues where the substituted amino acid residues may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code or ii substitution with one or more of amino acid residues having a substituent group or iii fusion of the mature polypeptide with another compound such as a compound to increase the stability and or solubility of the polypeptide for example polyethylene glycol or iv fusion of the polypeptide with additional amino acids such as for example an IgG Fc fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence facilitating purification. Such variant polypeptides are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.

For example polypeptide variants containing amino acid substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids may produce proteins with improved characteristics such as less aggregation. Aggregation of pharmaceutical formulations both reduces activity and increases clearance due to the aggregate s immunogenic activity. Pinckard et al. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2 331 340 1967 Robbins et al. Diabetes 36 838 845 1987 Cleland et al. Crit. Rev. Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 10 307 377 1993 . 

Moreover the invention further includes polypeptide variants created through the application of molecular evolution DNA Shuffling methodology to the polynucleotide disclosed as SEQ ID NO 1 the sequence of the clone submitted in a deposit and or the cDNA encoding the polypeptide disclosed as SEQ ID NO 2. Such DNA Shuffling technology is known in the art and more particularly described elsewhere herein e.g. WPC Stemmer PNAS 91 10747 1994 and in the Examples provided herein .

A further embodiment of the invention relates to a polypeptide which comprises the amino acid sequence of the present invention having an amino acid sequence which contains at least one amino acid substitution but not more than 50 amino acid substitutions even more preferably not more than 40 amino acid substitutions still more preferably not more than 30 amino acid substitutions and still even more preferably not more than 20 amino acid substitutions. Of course in order of ever increasing preference it is highly preferable for a peptide or polypeptide to have an amino acid sequence which comprises the amino acid sequence of the present invention which contains at least one but not more than 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acid substitutions. In specific embodiments the number of additions substitutions and or deletions in the amino acid sequence of the present invention or fragments thereof e.g. the mature form and or other fragments described herein is 1 5 5 10 5 25 5 50 10 50 or 50 150 conservative amino acid substitutions are preferable.

The present invention is directed to polynucleotide fragments of the polynucleotides of the invention in addition to polypeptides encoded therein by said polynucleotides and or fragments.

In the present invention a polynucleotide fragment refers to a short polynucleotide having a nucleic acid sequence which is a portion of that contained in a deposited clone or encoding the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA in a deposited clone is a portion of that shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or the complementary strand thereto or is a portion of a polynucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2. The nucleotide fragments of the invention are preferably at least about 15 nt and more preferably at least about 20 nt still more preferably at least about 30 nt and even more preferably at least about 40 nt at least about 50 nt at least about 75 nt or at least about 150 nt in length. A fragment at least 20 nt in length for example is intended to include 20 or more contiguous bases from the cDNA sequence contained in a deposited clone or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1. In this context about includes the particularly recited value a value larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 nucleotides at either terminus or at both termini. These nucleotide fragments have uses that include but are not limited to as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course larger fragments e.g. 50 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 450 475 500 525 550 575 600 650 700 750 850 900 950 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500 1600 1700 1800 1900 2000 nucleotides are preferred.

Moreover representative examples of polynucleotide fragments of the invention include for example fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of a sequence from about nucleotide number 1 50 51 100 101 150 151 200 201 250 251 300 301 350 351 400 401 450 451 500 501 550 551 600 651 700 701 750 751 800 800 850 851 900 901 950 951 1000 1001 1050 1051 1100 1101 1150 1151 1200 1201 1250 1251 1300 1301 1350 1351 1400 1401 1450 1451 1500 1501 1550 1551 1600 1601 1650 1651 1700 1701 1750 1751 1800 1801 1850 1851 1900 1901 1950 1951 2000 or 2001 to the end of SEQ ID NO 1 or the complementary strand thereto or the cDNA contained in a deposited clone. In this context about includes the particularly recited ranges and ranges larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 nucleotides at either terminus or at both termini. Preferably these fragments encode a polypeptide which has biological activity. More preferably these polynucleotides can be used as probes or primers as discussed herein. Also encompassed by the present invention are polynucleotides which hybridize to these nucleic acid molecules under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency conditions as are the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides.

In the present invention a polypeptide fragment refers to an amino acid sequence which is a portion of that contained in SEQ ID NO 2 or encoded by the cDNA contained in a deposited clone. Protein polypeptide fragments may be free standing or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or region most preferably as a single continuous region. Representative examples of polypeptide fragments of the invention include for example fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of from about amino acid number 1 20 21 40 41 60 61 80 81 100 102 120 121 140 141 160 or 161 to the end of the coding region. Moreover polypeptide fragments can be about 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 or 150 amino acids in length. In this context about includes the particularly recited ranges or values and ranges or values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids at either extreme or at both extremes. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

Preferred polypeptide fragments include the full length protein. Further preferred polypeptide fragments include the full length protein having a continuous series of deleted residues from the amino or the carboxy terminus or both. For example any number of amino acids ranging from 1 60 can be deleted from the amino terminus of the full length polypeptide. Similarly any number of amino acids ranging from 1 30 can be deleted from the carboxy terminus of the full length protein. Furthermore any combination of the above amino and carboxy terminus deletions are preferred. Similarly polynucleotides encoding these polypeptide fragments are also preferred.

Also preferred are polypeptide and polynucleotide fragments characterized by structural or functional domains such as fragments that comprise alpha helix and alpha helix forming regions beta sheet and beta sheet forming regions turn and turn forming regions coil and coil forming regions hydrophilic regions hydrophobic regions alpha amphipathic regions beta amphipathic regions flexible regions surface forming regions substrate binding region and high antigenic index regions. Polypeptide fragments of SEQ ID NO 2 falling within conserved domains are specifically contemplated by the present invention. Moreover polynucleotides encoding these domains are also contemplated.

Other preferred polypeptide fragments are biologically active fragments. Biologically active fragments are those exhibiting activity similar but not necessarily identical to an activity of the polypeptide of the present invention. The biological activity of the fragments may include an improved desired activity or a decreased undesirable activity. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptide fragments are also encompassed by the invention.

In a preferred embodiment the functional activity displayed by a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide fragment of the invention may be one or more biological activities typically associated with the full length polypeptide of the invention. Illustrative of these biological activities includes the fragments ability to bind to at least one of the same antibodies which bind to the full length protein the fragments ability to interact with at lease one of the same proteins which bind to the full length the fragments ability to elicit at least one of the same immune responses as the full length protein i.e. to cause the immune system to create antibodies specific to the same epitope etc. the fragments ability to bind to at least one of the same polynucleotides as the full length protein the fragments ability to bind to a receptor of the full length protein the fragments ability to bind to a ligand of the full length protein and the fragments ability to multimerize with the full length protein. However the skilled artisan would appreciate that some fragments may have biological activities which are desirable and directly inapposite to the biological activity of the full length protein. The functional activity of polypeptides of the invention including fragments variants derivatives and analogs thereof can be determined by numerous methods available to the skilled artisan some of which are described elsewhere herein.

The present invention encompasses polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of an epitope of the polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 or an epitope of the polypeptide sequence encoded by a polynucleotide sequence contained in ATCC deposit No. 4454 or encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the complement of the sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 or contained in ATCC deposit No. 4454 under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions as defined supra. The present invention further encompasses polynucleotide sequences encoding an epitope of a polypeptide sequence of the invention such as for example the sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO 1 polynucleotide sequences of the complementary strand of a polynucleotide sequence encoding an epitope of the invention and polynucleotide sequences which hybridize to the complementary strand under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions defined supra.

The term epitopes as used herein refers to portions of a polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably in a human. In a preferred embodiment the present invention encompasses a polypeptide comprising an epitope as well as the polynucleotide encoding this polypeptide. An immunogenic epitope as used herein is defined as a portion of a protein that elicits an antibody response in an animal as determined by any method known in the art for example by the methods for generating antibodies described infra. See for example Geysen et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 3998 4002 1983 . The term antigenic epitope as used herein is defined as a portion of a protein to which an antibody can immunospecifically bind its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art for example by the immunoassays described herein. Immunospecific binding excludes non specific binding but does not necessarily exclude cross reactivity with other antigens. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.

Fragments which function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. See e.g. Houghten Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 5131 5135 1985 further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 631 211 .

In the present invention antigenic epitopes preferably contain a sequence of at least 4 at least 5 at least 6 at least 7 more preferably at least 8 at least 9 at least 10 at least 11 at least 12 at least 13 at least 14 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 and most preferably between about 15 to about 30 amino acids. Preferred polypeptides comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes are at least 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 100 amino acid residues in length or longer. Additional non exclusive preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein as well as portions thereof. Antigenic epitopes are useful for example to raise antibodies including monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the epitope. Preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein as well as any combination of two three four five or more of these antigenic epitopes. Antigenic epitopes can be used as the target molecules in immunoassays. See for instance Wilson et al. Cell 37 767 778 1984 Sutcliffe et al. Science 219 660 666 1983 .

Similarly immunogenic epitopes can be used for example to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art. See for instance Sutcliffe et al. supra Wilson et al. supra Chow et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 910 914 and Bittle et al. J. Gen. Virol. 66 2347 2354 1985 . Preferred immunogenic epitopes include the immunogenic epitopes disclosed herein as well as any combination of two three four five or more of these immunogenic epitopes. The polypeptides comprising one or more immunogenic epitopes may be presented for eliciting an antibody response together with a carrier protein such as an albumin to an animal system such as rabbit or mouse or if the polypeptide is of sufficient length at least about 25 amino acids the polypeptide may be presented without a carrier. However immunogenic epitopes comprising as few as 8 to 10 amino acids have been shown to be sufficient to raise antibodies capable of binding to at the very least linear epitopes in a denatured polypeptide e.g. in Western blotting .

Epitope bearing polypeptides of the present invention may be used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art including but not limited to in vivo immunization in vitro immunization and phage display methods. See e.g. Sutcliffe et al. supra Wilson et al. supra and Bittle et al. J. Gen. Virol. 66 2347 2354 1985 . If in vivo immunization is used animals may be immunized with free peptide however anti peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling the peptide to a macromolecular carrier such as keyhole limpet hemacyanin KLH or tetanus toxoid. For instance peptides containing cysteine residues may be coupled to a carrier using a linker such as maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester MBS while other peptides may be coupled to carriers using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Animals such as rabbits rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier coupled peptides for instance by intraperitoneal and or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100 g of peptide or carrier protein and Freund s adjuvant or any other adjuvant known for stimulating an immune response. Several booster injections may be needed for instance at intervals of about two weeks to provide a useful titer of anti peptide antibody which can be detected for example by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of anti peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti peptide antibodies for instance by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.

As one of skill in the art will appreciate and as discussed above the polypeptides of the present invention comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope can be fused to other polypeptide sequences. For example the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins IgA IgE IgG IgM or portions thereof CH1 CH2 CH3 or any combination thereof and portions thereof resulting in chimeric polypeptides. Such fusion proteins may facilitate purification and may increase half life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See e.g. EP 394 827 Traunecker et al. Nature 331 84 86 1988 . Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens e.g. insulin conjugated to an FcRn binding partner such as IgG or Fc fragments see e.g. PCT Publications WO 96 22024 and WO 99 04813 . IgG Fusion proteins that have a disulfide linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion disulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric polypeptides or fragments thereof alone. See e.g. Fountoulakis et al. J. Biochem. 270 3958 3964 1995 . Nucleic acids encoding the above epitopes can also be recombined with a gene of interest as an epitope tag e.g. the hemagglutinin HA tag or flag tag to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines Janknecht et al. 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 8972 897 . In this system the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the gene is translationally fused to an amino terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni2 nitriloacetic acid agarose column and histidine tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole containing buffers.

Additional fusion proteins of the invention may be generated through the techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling . DNA shuffling may be employed to modulate the activities of polypeptides of the invention such methods can be used to generate polypeptides with altered activity as well as agonists and antagonists of the polypeptides. See generally U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 605 793 5 811 238 5 830 721 5 834 252 and 5 837 458 and Patten et al. Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8 724 33 1997 Harayama Trends Biotechnol. 16 2 76 82 1998 Hansson et al. J. Mol. Biol. 287 265 76 1999 and Lorenzo and Blasco Biotechniques 24 2 308 13 1998 each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . In one embodiment alteration of polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO 1 and the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments by homologous or site specific recombination to generate variation in the polynucleotide sequence. In another embodiment polynucleotides of the invention or the encoded polypeptides may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error prone PCR random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. In another embodiment one or more components motifs sections parts domains fragments etc. of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention may be recombined with one or more components motifs sections parts domains fragments etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.

Further polypeptides of the invention relate to antibodies and T cell antigen receptors TCR which immunospecifically bind a polypeptide polypeptide fragment or variant of SEQ ID NO 2 and or an epitope of the present invention as determined by immunoassays well known in the art for assaying specific antibody antigen binding . Antibodies of the invention include but are not limited to polyclonal monoclonal monovalent bispecific heteroconjugate multispecific human humanized or chimeric antibodies single chain antibodies Fab fragments F ab fragments fragments produced by a Fab expression library anti idiotypic anti Id antibodies including e.g. anti Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention and epitope binding fragments of any of the above. The term antibody as used herein refers to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules i.e. molecules that contain an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen. The immunoglobulin molecules of the invention can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD IgA and IgY class e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2 or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. Moreover the term antibody Ab or monoclonal antibody Mab is meant to include intact molecules as well as antibody fragments such as for example Fab and F ab 2 fragments which are capable of specifically binding to protein. Fab and F ab 2 fragments lack the Fc fragment of intact antibody clear more rapidly from the circulation of the animal or plant and may have less non specific tissue binding than an intact antibody Wahl et al. J. Nucl. Med. 24 316 325 1983 . Thus these fragments are preferred as well as the products of a FAB or other immunoglobulin expression library. Moreover antibodies of the present invention include chimeric single chain and humanized antibodies.

Most preferably the antibodies are human antigen binding antibody fragments of the present invention and include but are not limited to Fab Fab and F ab 2 Fd single chain Fvs scFv single chain antibodies disulfide linked Fvs sdFv and fragments comprising either a VL or VH domain. Antigen binding antibody fragments including single chain antibodies may comprise the variable region s alone or in combination with the entirety or a portion of the following hinge region CH1 CH2 and CH3 domains. Also included in the invention are antigen binding fragments also comprising any combination of variable region s with a hinge region CH1 CH2 and CH3 domains. The antibodies of the invention may be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably the antibodies are human murine e.g. mouse and rat donkey ship rabbit goat guinea pig camel horse or chicken. As used herein human antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulin and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins as described infra and for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 939 598 by Kucherlapati et al.

The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific bispecific trispecific or of greater multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of a polypeptide of the present invention or may be specific for both a polypeptide of the present invention as well as for a heterologous epitope such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material. See e.g. PCT publications WO 93 17715 WO 92 08802 WO 91 00360 WO 92 05793 Tutt et al. J. Immunol. 147 60 69 1991 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 474 893 4 714 681 4 925 648 5 573 920 5 601 819 Kostelny et al. J.

Antibodies of the present invention may be described or specified in terms of the epitope s or portion s of a polypeptide of the present invention which they recognize or specifically bind. The epitope s or polypeptide portion s may be specified as described herein e.g. by N terminal and C terminal positions by size in contiguous amino acid residues or listed in the Tables and Figures. Antibodies which specifically bind any epitope or polypeptide of the present invention may also be excluded. Therefore the present invention includes antibodies that specifically bind polypeptides of the present invention and allows for the exclusion of the same.

As discussed in more detail below the antibodies of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N or C terminus or chemically conjugated including covalently and non covalently conjugations to polypeptides or other compositions.

See e.g. PCT publications WO 92 08495 WO 91 14438 WO 89 12624 U.S. Pat. No. 5 314 995 and EP 396 387.

The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are modified i.e. by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from generating an anti idiotypic response. For example but not by way of limitation the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified e.g. by glycosylation acetylation pegylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage acetylation formylation metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin etc. Additionally the derivative may contain one or more non classical amino acids.

The antibodies of the present invention may comprise polyclonal antibodies. Methods of preparing polyclonal antibodies are known to the skilled artisan Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2ed. 1988 and Current Protocols Chapter 2 which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . In a preferred method a preparation of the BGS 42 protein is prepared and purified to render it substantially free of natural contaminants. Such a preparation is then introduced into an animal in order to produce polyclonal antisera of greater specific activity. For example a polypeptide of the invention can be administered to various host animals including but not limited to rabbits mice rats etc. to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. The administration of the polypeptides of the present invention may entail one or more injections of an immunizing agent and if desired an adjuvant. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species and include but are not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art. For the purposes of the invention immunizing agent may be defined as a polypeptide of the invention including fragments variants and or derivatives thereof in addition to fusions with heterologous polypeptides and other forms of the polypeptides described herein.

Typically the immunizing agent and or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections though they may also be given intramuscularly and or through IV . The immunizing agent may include polypeptides of the present invention or a fusion protein or variants thereof. Depending upon the nature of the polypeptides i.e. percent hydrophobicity percent hydrophilicity stability net charge isoelectric point etc. it may be useful to conjugate the immunizing agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized. Such conjugation includes either chemical conjugation by derivitizing active chemical functional groups to both the polypeptide of the present invention and the immunogenic protein such that a covalent bond is formed or through fusion protein based methodology or other methods known to the skilled artisan. Examples of such immunogenic proteins include but are not limited to keyhole limpet hemocyanin serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species including but not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanin dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and . Additional examples of adjuvants which may be employed includes the MPL TDM adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate . The immunization protocol may be selected by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation.

The antibodies of the present invention may comprise monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared using hybridoma methods such as those described by Kohler and Milstein Nature 256 495 1975 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 376 110 by Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2ed. 1988 by Hammerling et al. Monoclonal Antibodies and T Cell Hybridomas Elsevier N.Y. pp. 563 681 1981 K hler et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 6 511 1976 K hler et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 6 292 1976 or other methods known to the artisan. Other examples of methods which may be employed for producing monoclonal antibodies includes but are not limited to the human B cell hybridoma technique Kosbor et al. 1983 Immunology Today 4 72 Cole et al. 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 2026 2030 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al. 1985 Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 . Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG IgM IgE IgA IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAb of this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo. Production of high titers of mAbs in vivo makes this the presently preferred method of production.

In a hybridoma method a mouse a humanized mouse a mouse with a human immune system hamster or other appropriate host animal is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.

The immunizing agent will typically include polypeptides of the present invention or a fusion protein thereof. Preferably the immunizing agent consists of an BGS 42 polypeptide or more preferably with a BGS 42 polypeptide expressing cell. Such cells may be cultured in any suitable tissue culture medium however it is preferable to culture cells in Earle s modified Eagle s medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum inactivated at about 56 degrees C. and supplemented with about 10 g l of nonessential amino acids about 1 000 U ml of penicillin and about 100 ug ml of streptomycin. Generally either peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs are used if cells of human origin are desired or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding Monoclonal Antibodies Principles and Practice Academic Press 1986 pp. 59 103 . Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells particularly myeloma cells of rodent bovine and human origin. Usually rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells may be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused immortalized cells. For example if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines which can be obtained for instance from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. More preferred are the parent myeloma cell line SP2O as provided by the ATCC . As inferred throughout the specification human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor J. Immunol. 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 pp. 51 63 .

The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoabsorbant assay ELISA . Such techniques are known in the art and within the skill of the artisan. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollart Anal. Biochem. 107 220 1980 .

After the desired hybridoma cells are identified the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding supra and or according to Wands et al. Gastroenterology 80 225 232 1981 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium and RPMI 1640. Alternatively the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A sepharose hydroxyapatite chromatography gel exclusion chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

The skilled artisan would acknowledge that a variety of methods exist in the art for the production of monoclonal antibodies and thus the invention is not limited to their sole production in hydridomas. For example the monoclonal antibodies may be made by recombinant DNA methods such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567. In this context the term monoclonal antibody refers to an antibody derived from a single eukaryotic phage or prokaryotic clone. The DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies or such chains from human humanized or other sources . The hydridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transformed into host cells such as Simian COS cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also may be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Morrison et al supra or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody.

The antibodies may be monovalent antibodies. Methods for preparing monovalent antibodies are well known in the art. For example one method involves recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light chain and modified heavy chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy chain crosslinking. Alternatively the relevant cysteine residues are substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to prevent crosslinking.

In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof particularly Fab fragments can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma recombinant and phage display technologies or a combination thereof. For example monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught for example in Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in Monoclonal Antibodies and T Cell Hybridomas 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties . The term monoclonal antibody as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term monoclonal antibody refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone including any eukaryotic prokaryotic or phage clone and not the method by which it is produced.

Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art and are discussed in detail in the Examples described herein. In a non limiting example mice can be immunized with a polypeptide of the invention or a cell expressing such peptide. Once an immune response is detected e.g. antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC . Hybridomas are selected and cloned byclimited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of the invention. Ascites fluid which generally contains high levels of antibodies can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.

Accordingly the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention wherein preferably the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of the invention.

Antibody fragments which recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques. For example Fab and F ab 2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules using enzymes such as papain to produce Fab fragments or pepsin to produce F ab 2 fragments . F ab 2 fragments contain the variable region the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.

For example the antibodies of the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library e.g. human or murine . Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen e.g. using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al. J. Immunol. Methods 182 41 50 1995 Ames et al. J. Immunol. Methods 184 177 186 1995 Kettleborough et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 24 952 958 1994 Persic et al. Gene 187 9 18 1997 Burton et al.

As described in the above references after phage selection the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies including human antibodies or any other desired antigen binding fragment and expressed in any desired host including mammalian cells insect cells plant cells yeast and bacteria e.g. as described in detail below. For example techniques to recombinantly produce Fab Fab and F ab 2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92 22324 Mullinax et al. BioTechniques 12 6 864 869 1992 and Sawai et al. AJRI 34 26 34 1995 and Better et al. Science 240 1041 1043 1988 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties . Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 946 778 and 5 258 498 Huston et al.

For some uses including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays it may be preferable to use chimeric humanized or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g. Morrison Science 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. BioTechniques 4 214 1986 Gillies et al. 1989 J. Immunol. Methods 125 191 202 Cabilly et al. Taniguchi et al. EP 171496 Morrison et al. EP 173494 Neuberger et al. WO 8601533 Robinson et al. WO 8702671 Boulianne et al. Nature 312 643 1984 Neuberger et al. Nature 314 268 1985 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 807 715 4 816 567 and 4 816397 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from the non human species and a framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See e.g. Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 1988 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including for example CDR grafting EP 239 400 PCT publication WO 91 09967 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 225 539 5 530 101 and 5 585 089 veneering or resurfacing EP 592 106 EP 519 596 Padlan Molecular Immunology 28 4 5 489 498 1991 Studnicka et al. Protein Engineering 7 6 805 814 1994 Roguska. et al. PNAS 91 969 973 1994 and chain shuffling U.S. Pat. No. 5 565 332 . Generally a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the methods of Winter and co workers Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Reichmann et al. Nature 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. Science 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possible some FR residues are substituted from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 329 1988 1 and Presta Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 1992 .

Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 444 887 and 4 716 111 and PCT publications WO 98 46645 WO 98 50433 WO 98 24893 WO 98 16654 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 and WO 91 10741 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The techniques of Cole et al. and Boerder et al. are also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies Cole et al. Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Riss 1985 and Boerner et al. J. Immunol. 147 1 86 95 1991 .

Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively the human variable region constant region and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar Int. Rev. Immunol. 13 65 93 1995 . For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies see e.g. PCT publications WO 98 24893 WO 92 01047 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 European Patent No. 0 598 877 U.S. Pat.

In addition companies such as Abgenix Inc. Freemont Calif. Genpharm San Jose Calif. and Medarex Inc. Princeton N.J. can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.

Similarly human antibodies can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals e.g. mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge human antibody production is observed which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects including gene rearrangement assembly and creation of an antibody repertoire. This approach is described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 807 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 661 106 and in the following scientific publications Marks et al.

Immunol. 13 65 93 1995 .

Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as guided selection. In this approach a selected non human monoclonal antibody e.g. a mouse antibody is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. Jespers et al. Bio technology 12 899 903 1988 .

Further antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention can in turn be utilized to generate anti idiotype antibodies that mimic polypeptides of the invention using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. See e.g. Greenspan Bona FASEB J. 7 5 437 444 1989 and Nissinoff J. Immunol. 147 8 2429 2438 1991 . For example antibodies which bind to and competitively inhibit polypeptide multimerization and or binding of a polypeptide of the invention to a ligand can be used to generate anti idiotypes that mimic the polypeptide multimerization and or binding domain and as a consequence bind to and neutralize polypeptide and or its ligand. Such neutralizing anti idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti idiotypes can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize polypeptide ligand. For example such anti idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind a polypeptide of the invention and or to bind its ligands receptors and thereby block its biological activity.

Such anti idiotypic antibodies capable of binding to the BGS 42 polypeptide can be produced in a two step procedure. Such a method makes use of the fact that antibodies are themselves antigens and therefore it is possible to obtain an antibody that binds to a second antibody. In accordance with this method protein specific antibodies are used to immunize an animal preferably a mouse. The splenocytes of such an animal are then used to produce hybridoma cells and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify clones that produce an antibody whose ability to bind to the protein specific antibody can be blocked by the polypeptide. Such antibodies comprise anti idiotypic antibodies to the protein specific antibody and can be used to immunize an animal to induce formation of further protein specific antibodies.

The antibodies of the present invention may be bispecific antibodies. Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal Preferably human or humanized antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present invention one of the binding specificities may be directed towards a polypeptide of the present invention the other may be for any other antigen and preferably for a cell surface protein receptor receptor subunit tissue specific antigen virally derived protein virally encoded envelope protein bacterially derived protein or bacterial surface protein etc.

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two heavy chains have different specificities Milstein and Cuello Nature 305 537 539 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 published 13 May 1993 and in Traunecker et al. EMBO J. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

Antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites can be fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transformed into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. Meth. In Enzym. 121 210 1986 .

Heteroconjugate antibodies are also contemplated by the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for the treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 20373 and EP03089 . It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry including those involving crosslinking agents. For example immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioester bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl 4 mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980.

The invention further provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention and fragments thereof. The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent or lower stringency hybridization conditions e.g. as defined supra to polynucleotides that encode an antibody preferably that specifically binds to a polypeptide of the invention preferably an antibody that binds to a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2.

The polynucleotides may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined by any method known in the art. For example if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. BioTechniques 17 242 1994 which briefly involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

Alternatively a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source e.g. an antibody cDNA library or a cDNA library generated from or nucleic acid preferably poly A RNA isolated from any tissue or cells expressing the antibody such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3 and 5 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify e.g. a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.

Once the nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the antibody is determined the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences e.g. recombinant DNA techniques site directed mutagenesis PCR etc. see for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 1990 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence for example to create amino acid substitutions deletions and or insertions.

In a specific embodiment the amino acid sequence of the heavy and or light chain variable domains may be inspected to identify the sequences of the complementarity determining regions CDRs by methods that are well know in the art e.g. by comparison to known amino acid sequences of other heavy and light chain variable regions to determine the regions of sequence hypervariability. Using routine recombinant DNA techniques one or more of the CDRs may be inserted within framework regions e.g. into human framework regions to humanize a non human antibody as described supra. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions and preferably human framework regions see e.g. Chothia et al. J. Mol. Biol. 278 457 479 1998 for a listing of human framework regions . Preferably the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds a polypeptide of the invention. Preferably as discussed supra one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions and preferably the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art.

In addition techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies Morrison et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81 851 855 1984 Neuberger et al. Nature 312 604 608 1984 Takeda et al. Nature 314 452 454 1985 by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. As described supra a chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region e.g. humanized antibodies.

Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 Bird Science 242 423 42 1988 Huston et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 5879 5883 1988 and Ward et al. Nature 334 544 54 1989 can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used Skerra et al. Science 242 1038 1041 1988 .

More preferably a clone encoding an antibody of the present invention may be obtained according to the method described in the Example section herein.

The antibodies of the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies in particular by chemical synthesis or preferably by recombinant expression techniques.

Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention or fragment derivative or analog thereof e.g. a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention or a single chain antibody of the invention requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody or portion thereof preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain of the invention has been obtained the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention or a heavy or light chain thereof or a heavy or light chain variable domain operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule see e.g. PCT Publication WO 86 05807 PCT Publication WO 89 01036 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 464 and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.

The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention or a heavy or light chain thereof or a single chain antibody of the invention operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double chained antibodies vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule as detailed below.

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing antibody coding sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing antibody coding sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 3T3 cells harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter . Preferably bacterial cells such as and more preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies Foecking et al. Gene 45 101 1986 Cockett et al. Bio Technology 8 2 1990 .

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. EMBO J. 2 1791 1983 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye Nucleic Acids Res. 13 3101 3109 1985 Van Heeke Schuster J. Biol. Chem. 24 5503 5509 1989 and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non essential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts. e.g. see Logan Shenk Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 355 359 1984 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see Bittner et al. Methods in Enzymol. 153 51 544 1987 .

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK Hela COS MDCK 293 3T3 W138 and in particular breast cancer cell lines such as for example BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT20 and T47D and normal mammary gland cell line such as for example CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. Cell 11 223 1977 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48 202 1992 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. Cell 22 817 1980 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 357 1980 O Hare et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78 1527 1981 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone and such methods are described for example in Ausubel et al. eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY 1993 Kriegler Gene Transfer and Expression A Laboratory Manual Stockton Press NY 1990 and in Chapters 12 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds Current Protocols in Human Genetics John Wiley Sons NY 1994 Colberre Garapin et al. J. Mol. Biol. 150 1 1981 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning Vol. 3. Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3 257 1983 .

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used which encodes and is capable of expressing both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot Nature 322 52 1986 Kohler Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 2197 1980 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by an animal chemically synthesized or recombinantly expressed it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In addition the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification.

The present invention encompasses antibodies recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated including both covalently and non covalently conjugations to a polypeptide or portion thereof preferably at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 or 100 amino acids of the polypeptide of the present invention to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct but may occur through linker sequences. The antibodies may be specific for antigens other than polypeptides or portion thereof preferably at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 or 100 amino acids of the polypeptide of the present invention. For example antibodies may be used to target the polypeptides of the present invention to particular cell types either in vitro or in vivo by fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibodies specific for particular cell surface receptors. Antibodies fused or conjugated to the polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art. See e.g. Harbor et al. supra and PCT publication WO 93 21232 EP 439 095 Naramura et al. Immunol. Lett. 39 91 99 1994 U.S. Pat. No. 5 474 981 Gillies et al. PNAS 89 1428 1432 1992 Fell et al. J. Immunol. 146 2446 2452 1991 which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.

The present invention further includes compositions comprising the polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to antibody domains other than the variable regions. For example the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to an antibody Fc region or portion thereof. The antibody portion fused to a polypeptide of the present invention may comprise the constant region hinge region CH1 domain CH2 domain and CH3 domain or any combination of whole domains or portions thereof. The polypeptides may also be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to form multimers. For example Fc portions fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can form dimers through disulfide bonding between the Fc portions. Higher multimeric forms can be made by fusing the polypeptides to portions of IgA and IgM. Methods for fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibody portions are known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 336 603 5 622 929 5 359 046 5 349 053 5 447 851 5 112 946 EP 307 434 EP 367 166 PCT publications WO 96 04388 WO 91 06570 Ashkenazi et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 10535 10539 1991 Zheng et al. J. Immunol. 154 5590 5600 1995 and Vil et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 11337 11341 1992 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties .

As discussed supra the polypeptides corresponding to a polypeptide polypeptide fragment or a variant of SEQ ID NO 2 may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to increase the in vivo half life of the polypeptides or for use in immunoassays using methods known in the art. Further the polypeptides corresponding to SEQ ID NO 2 may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to facilitate purification. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. EP 394 827 Traunecker et al. Nature 331 84 86 1988 . The polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to an antibody having disulfide linked dimeric structures due to the IgG may also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. Fountoulakis et al. J. Biochem. 270 3958 3964 1995 . In many cases the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis and thus can result in for example improved pharmacokinetic properties. EP A 232 262 . Alternatively deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed detected and purified would be desired. For example the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery for example human proteins such as hIL 5 have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL 5. See Bennett et al. J. Molecular Recognition 8 52 58 1995 Johanson et al. J. Biol. Chem. 270 9459 9471 1995 .

Moreover the antibodies or fragments thereof the present invention can be fused to marker sequences such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector QIAGEN Inc. 9259 Eton Avenue Chatsworth Calif. 91311 among others many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 821 824 1989 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include but are not limited to the HA tag which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein Wilson et al. Cell 37 767 1984 and the flag tag.

The present invention further encompasses antibodies or fragments thereof conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. The antibodies can be used diagnostically to for example monitor the development or progression of a tumor as part of a clinical testing procedure to e.g. determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes prosthetic groups fluorescent materials luminescent materials bioluminescent materials radioactive materials positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the antibody or fragment thereof or indirectly through an intermediate such as for example a linker known in the art using techniques known in the art. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 741 900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase beta galactosidase or acetylcholinesterase examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin biotin and avidin biotin examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone fluorescein fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin an example of a luminescent material includes luminol examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase luciferin and aequorin and examples of suitable radioactive material include 125I 131I 111In or 99Tc.

Further an antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin e.g. a cytostatic or cytocidal agent a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion e.g. alpha emitters such as for example 213Bi. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include paclitaxol cytochalasin B gramicidin D ethidium bromide emetine mitomycin etoposide tenoposide vincristine vinblastine colchicin doxorubicin daunorubicin dihydroxy anthracin dione mitoxantrone mithramycin actinomycin D 1 dehydrotestosterone glucocorticoids procaine tetracaine lidocaine propranolol and puromycin and analogs or homologues thereof. Therapeutic agents include but are not limited to antimetabolites e.g. methotrexate 6 mercaptopurine 6 thioguanine cytarabine 5 fluorouracil decarbazine alkylating agents e.g. mechlorethamine thioepa chlorambucil melphalan carmustine BSNU and lomustine CCNU cyclophosphamide busulfan dibromomannitol streptozotocin mitomycin C and cis dichlorodiamine platinum II DDP cisplatin anthracyclines e.g. daunorubicin formerly daunomycin and doxorubicin antibiotics e.g. dactinomycin formerly actinomycin bleomycin mithramycin and anthramycin AMC and anti mitotic agents e.g. vincristine and vinblastine .

The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response the therapeutic agent or drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include for example a toxin such as abrin ricin A pseudomonas exotoxin or diphtheria toxin a protein such as tumor necrosis factor a interferon interferon nerve tubulin tyrosine ligase protein platelet derived tubulin tyrosine ligase protein tissue plasminogen activator an apoptotic agent e.g. TNF alpha TNF beta AIM I See International Publication No. WO 97 33899 AIM II See International Publication No. WO 97 34911 Fas Ligand Takahashi et al. Int. Immunol. 6 1567 1574 1994 VEGI See International Publication No. WO 99 23105 a thrombotic agent or an anti angiogenic agent e.g. angiostatin or endostatin or biological response modifiers such as for example lymphokines interleukin 1 IL 1 interleukin 2 IL 2 interleukin 6 IL 6 granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF or other tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins.

Antibodies may also be attached to solid supports which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include but are not limited to glass cellulose polyacrylamide nylon polystyrene polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.

Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known see e.g. Arnon et al. Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy Reisfeld et al. eds. pp. 243 56 Alan R. Liss Inc. 1985 Hellstrom et al.

Alternatively an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

An antibody with or without a therapeutic moiety conjugated to it administered alone or in combination with cytotoxic factor s and or cytokine s can be used as a therapeutic.

The present invention also encompasses the creation of synthetic antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention. One example of synthetic antibodies is described in Radrizzani M. et al. Medicina Aires 59 6 753 8 1999 . Recently a new class of synthetic antibodies has been described and are referred to as molecularly imprinted polymers MIPs Semorex Inc. . Antibodies peptides and enzymes are often used as molecular recognition elements in chemical and biological sensors. However their lack of stability and signal transduction mechanisms limits their use as sensing devices. Molecularly imprinted polymers MIPs are capable of mimicking the function of biological receptors but with less stability constraints. Such polymers provide high sensitivity and selectivity while maintaining excellent thermal and mechanical stability. MIPs have the ability to bind to small molecules and to target molecules such as organics and proteins with equal or greater potency than that of natural antibodies. These super MIPs have higher affinities for their target and thus require lower concentrations for efficacious binding.

During synthesis the MIPs are imprinted so as to have complementary size shape charge and functional groups of the selected target by using the target molecule itself such as a polypeptide antibody etc. or a substance having a very similar structure as its print or template. MIPs can be derivatized with the same reagents afforded to antibodies. For example fluorescent super MIPs can be coated onto beads or wells for use in highly sensitive separations or assays or for use in high throughput screening of proteins.

Moreover MIPs based upon the structure of the polypeptide s of the present invention may be useful in screening for compounds that bind to the polypeptide s of the invention. Such a MIP would serve the role of a synthetic receptor by mimicking the native architecture of the polypeptide. In fact the ability of a MIP to serve the role of a synthetic receptor has already been demonstrated for the estrogen receptor Ye L. Yu Y. Mosbach K Analyst. 126 6 760 5 2001 Dickert F L. Hayden O. Halikias K P Analyst. 126 6 766 71 2001 . A synthetic receptor may either be mimicked in its entirety e.g. as the entire protein or mimicked as a series of short peptides corresponding to the protein Rachkov A. Minoura N Biochim Biophys Acta. 1544 1 2 255 66 2001 . Such a synthetic receptor MIPs may be employed in any one or more of the screening methods described elsewhere herein.

MIPs have also been shown to be useful in sensing the presence of its mimicked molecule Cheng Z. Wang E. Yang X Biosens Bioelectron. 16 3 179 85 2001 Jenkins A L. Yin R. Jensen J. L Analyst. 126 6 798 802 2001 Jenkins A L. Yin R. Jensen J. L Analyst. 126 6 798 802 2001 . For example a MIP designed using a polypeptide of the present invention may be used in assays designed to identify and potentially quantitate the level of said polypeptide in a sample. Such a MIP may be used as a substitute for any component described in the assays or kits provided herein e.g. ELISA etc. .

A number of methods may be employed to create MIPs to a specific receptor ligand polypeptide peptide organic molecule. Several preferred methods are described by Esteban et al in J. Anal Chem. 370 7 795 802 2001 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety in addition to any references cited therein. Additional methods are known in the art and are encompassed by the present invention such as for example Hart B R. Shea K J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123 9 2072 3 2001 and Quaglia M. Chenon K. Hall A J. De Lorenzi E. Sellergren B J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123 10 2146 54 2001 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.

The antibodies of the present invention have various utilities. For example such antibodies may be used in diagnostic assays to detect the presence or quantification of the polypeptides of the invention in a sample. Such a diagnostic assay may be comprised of at least two steps. The first subjecting a sample with the antibody wherein the sample is a tissue e.g. human animal etc. biological fluid e.g. blood urine sputum semen amniotic fluid saliva etc. biological extract e.g. tissue or cellular homogenate etc. a protein microchip e.g. See Arenkov P et al. Anal Biochem. 278 2 123 131 2000 or a chromatography column etc. And a second step involving the quantification of antibody bound to the substrate. Alternatively the method may additionally involve a first step of attaching the antibody either covalently electrostatically or reversibly to a solid support and a second step of subjecting the bound antibody to the sample as defined above and elsewhere herein.

Various diagnostic assay techniques are known in the art such as competitive binding assays direct or indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays conducted in either heterogeneous or homogenous phases Zola Monoclonal Antibodies A Manual of Techniques CRC Press Inc. 1987 pp 147 158 . The antibodies used in the diagnostic assays can be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety should be capable of producing either directly or indirectly a detectable signal. For example the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope such as 2H 14C 32P or 125I a florescent or chemiluminescent compound such as fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine or luciferin or an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase beta galactosidase green fluorescent protein or horseradish peroxidase. Any method known in the art for conjugating the antibody to the detectable moiety may be employed including those methods described by Hunter et al. Nature 144 945 1962 Dafvid et al. Biochem. 13 1014 1974 Pain et al. J. Immunol. Metho. 40 219 1981 and Nygren J. Histochem. And Cytochem. 30 407 1982 .

Antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention are useful for the affinity purification of such polypeptides from recombinant cell culture or natural sources. In this process the antibodies against a particular polypeptide are immobilized on a suitable support such as a SEPHADEX resin or filter paper using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody then is contacted with a sample containing the polypeptides to be purified and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except for the desired polypeptides which are bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally the support is washed with another suitable solvent that will release the desired polypeptide from the antibody.

The antibodies of the invention may be utilized for immunophenotyping of cell lines and biological samples. The translation product of the gene of the present invention may be useful as a cell specific marker or more specifically as a cellular marker that is differentially expressed at various stages of differentiation and or maturation of particular cell types. Monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific epitope or combination of epitopes will allow for the screening of cellular populations expressing the marker. Various techniques can be utilized using monoclonal antibodies to screen for cellular populations expressing the marker s and include magnetic separation using antibody coated magnetic beads panning with antibody attached to a solid matrix i.e. plate and flow cytometry See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 985 660 and Morrison et al. Cell 96 737 49 1999 .

These techniques allow for the screening of particular populations of cells such as might be found with hematological malignancies i.e. minimal residual disease MRD in acute leukemic patients and non self cells in transplantations to prevent Graft versus Host Disease GVHD . Alternatively these techniques allow for the screening of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of undergoing proliferation and or differentiation as might be found in human umbilical cord blood.

The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for immunospecific binding by any method known in the art. The immunoassays which can be used include but are not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below but are not intended by way of limitation .

Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer 1 NP 40 or Triton X 100 1 sodium deoxycholate 0.1 SDS 0.15 M NaCl 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2 1 Trasylol supplemented with protein phosphatase and or protease inhibitors e.g. EDTA PMSF aprotinin sodium vanadate adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate incubating for a period of time e.g. 1 4 hours at 4 C. adding protein A and or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate incubating for about an hour or more at 4 C. washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by e.g. western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background e.g. pre clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads . For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.16.1.

Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel e.g. 8 20 SDS PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose PVDF or nylon blocking the membrane in blocking solution e.g. PBS with 3 BSA or non fat milk washing the membrane in washing buffer e.g. PBS Tween 20 blocking the membrane with primary antibody the antibody of interest diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in washing buffer blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody which recognizes the primary antibody e.g. an anti human antibody conjugated to an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase or radioactive molecule e.g. 32P or 125I diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in wash buffer and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.8.1.

ELISAs comprise preparing antigen coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase to the well and incubating for a period of time and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound instead a second antibody which recognizes the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further instead of coating the well with the antigen the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 11.2.1.

The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off rate of an antibody antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen e.g. 3H or 125I with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound e.g. 3H or 125I in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody.

The present invention is further directed to antibody based therapies which involve administering antibodies of the invention to an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably a human patient for treating one or more of the disclosed diseases disorders or conditions. Therapeutic compounds of the invention include but are not limited to antibodies of the invention including fragments analogs and derivatives thereof as described herein and nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention including fragments analogs and derivatives thereof and anti idiotypic antibodies as described herein . The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat inhibit or prevent diseases disorders or conditions associated with aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention including but not limited to any one or more of the diseases disorders or conditions described herein. The treatment and or prevention of diseases disorders or conditions associated with aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention includes but is not limited to alleviating symptoms associated with those diseases disorders or conditions. Antibodies of the invention may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein.

A summary of the ways in which the antibodies of the present invention may be used therapeutically includes binding polynucleotides or polypeptides of the present invention locally or systemically in the body or by direct cytotoxicity of the antibody e.g. as mediated by complement CDC or by effector cells ADCC . Some of these approaches are described in more detail below. Armed with the teachings provided herein one of ordinary skill in the art will know how to use the antibodies of the present invention for diagnostic monitoring or therapeutic purposes without undue experimentation.

The antibodies of this invention may be advantageously utilized in combination with other monoclonal or chimeric antibodies or with lymphokines or hematopoietic tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins such as e.g. IL 2 IL 3 and IL 7 for example which serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the antibodies.

The antibodies of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other types of treatments e.g. radiation therapy chemotherapy hormonal therapy immunotherapy and anti tumor agents . Generally administration of products of a species origin or species reactivity in the case of antibodies that is the same species as that of the patient is preferred. Thus in a preferred embodiment human antibodies fragments derivatives analogs or nucleic acids are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.

It is preferred to use high affinity and or potent in vivo inhibiting and or neutralizing antibodies against polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention fragments or regions thereof for both immunoassays directed to and therapy of disorders related to polynucleotides or polypeptides including fragments thereof of the present invention. Such antibodies fragments or regions will preferably have an affinity for polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention including fragments thereof. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5 10 2 M 10 2 M 5 10 3 M 10 3 M 5 10 4 M 10 4 M 5 10 5M 10 5M 5 10 6 M 10 6 M 5 10 7 M 10 7 M 5 10 8 M 10 8 M 5 10 9 M 10 9 M 5 10 10 M 10 10 M 5 10 11 M 10 11 M 5 10 12 M 10 12 M 5 10 13 M 10 13 M 5 10 14 M 10 14 M 5 10 15 M and 10 15 M.

Antibodies directed against polypeptides of the present invention are useful for inhibiting allergic reactions in animals. For example by administering a therapeutically acceptable dose of an antibody or antibodies of the present invention or a cocktail of the present antibodies or in combination with other antibodies of varying sources the animal may not elicit an allergic response to antigens.

Likewise one could envision cloning the gene encoding an antibody directed against a polypeptide of the present invention said polypeptide having the potential to elicit an allergic and or immune response in an organism and transforming the organism with said antibody gene such that it is expressed e.g. constitutively inducibly etc. in the organism. Thus the organism would effectively become resistant to an allergic response resulting from the ingestion or presence of such an immune allergic reactive polypeptide. Moreover such a use of the antibodies of the present invention may have particular utility in preventing and or ameliorating autoimmune diseases and or disorders as such conditions are typically a result of antibodies being directed against endogenous proteins. For example in the instance where the polypeptide of the present invention is responsible for modulating the immune response to auto antigens transforming the organism and or individual with a construct comprising any of the promoters disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art in addition to a polynucleotide encoding the antibody directed against the polypeptide of the present invention could effective inhibit the organisms immune system from eliciting an immune response to the auto antigen s . Detailed descriptions of therapeutic and or gene therapy applications of the present invention are provided elsewhere herein.

Alternatively antibodies of the present invention could be produced in a plant e.g. cloning the gene of the antibody directed against a polypeptide of the present invention and transforming a plant with a suitable vector comprising said gene for constitutive expression of the antibody within the plant and the plant subsequently ingested by an animal thereby conferring temporary immunity to the animal for the specific antigen the antibody is directed towards See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 914 123 and 6 034 298 .

In another embodiment antibodies of the present invention preferably polyclonal antibodies more preferably monoclonal antibodies and most preferably single chain antibodies can be used as a means of inhibiting gene expression of a particular gene or genes in a human mammal and or other organism. See for example International Publication Number WO 00 05391 published Feb. 3 2000 to Dow Agrosciences LLC. The application of such methods for the antibodies of the present invention are known in the art and are more particularly described elsewhere herein.

In yet another embodiment antibodies of the present invention may be useful for multimerizing the polypeptides of the present invention. For example certain proteins may confer enhanced biological activity when present in a multimeric state i.e. such enhanced activity may be due to the increased effective concentration of such proteins whereby more protein is available in a localized location .

In a specific embodiment nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding antibodies or functional derivatives thereof are administered to treat inhibit or prevent a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention the nucleic acids produce their encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect.

Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.

For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy see Goldspiel et al. Clinical Pharmacy 12 488 505 1993 Wu and Wu Biotherapy 3 87 95 1991 Tolstoshev Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32 573 596 1993 Mulligan Science 260 926 932 1993 and Morgan and Anderson Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62 191 217 1993 May TIBTECH 11 5 155 215 1993 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY 1993 and Kriegler Gene Transfer and Expression A Laboratory Manual Stockton Press NY 1990 .

In a preferred aspect the compound comprises nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody said nucleic acid sequences being part of expression vectors that express the antibody or fragments or chimeric proteins or heavy or light chains thereof in a suitable host. In particular such nucleic acid sequences have promoters operably linked to the antibody coding region said promoter being inducible or constitutive and optionally tissue specific. In another particular embodiment nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids Koller and Smithies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 . In specific embodiments the expressed antibody molecule is a single chain antibody alternatively the nucleic acid sequences include sequences encoding both the heavy and light chains or fragments thereof of the antibody.

Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid carrying vectors or indirect in which case cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known respectively as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art e.g. by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular e.g. by infection using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors see U.S. Pat. No. 4 980 286 or by direct injection of naked DNA or by use of microparticle bombardment e.g. a gene gun Biolistic Dupont or coating with lipids or cell surface receptors or transfecting agents encapsulation in liposomes microparticles or microcapsules or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu and Wu J. Biol. Chem. 262 4429 4432 1987 which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors etc. In another embodiment nucleic acid ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression by targeting a specific receptor see e.g. PCT Publications WO 92 06180 WO 92 22635 WO92 20316 WO93 14188 WO 93 20221 . Alternatively the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination Koller and Smithies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 .

In a specific embodiment viral vectors that contains nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody of the invention are used. For example a retroviral vector can be used see Miller et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 581 599 1993 . These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al. Biotherapy 6 291 302 1994 which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are Clowes et al. J. Clin. Invest. 93 644 651 1994 Kiem et al. Blood 83 1467 1473 1994 Salmons and Gunzberg Human Gene Therapy 4 129 141 1993 and Grossman and Wilson Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3 110 114 1993 .

Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus based delivery systems are liver the central nervous system endothelial cells and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3 499 503 1993 present a review of adenovirus based gene therapy. Bout et al. Human Gene Therapy 5 3 10 1994 demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al. Science 252 431 434 1991 Rosenfeld et al. Cell 68 143 155 1992 Mastrangeli et al. J. Clin. Invest. 91 225 234 1993 PCT Publication WO94 12649 and Wang et al. Gene Therapy 2 775 783 1995 . In a preferred embodiment adenovirus vectors are used.

Adeno associated virus AAV has also been proposed for use in gene therapy Walsh et al. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204 289 300 1993 U.S. Pat. No. 5 436 146 .

Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation lipofection calcium phosphate mediated transfection or viral infection. Usually the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.

In this embodiment the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art including but not limited to transfection electroporation microinjection infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences cell fusion chromosome mediated gene transfer microcell mediated gene transfer spheroplast fusion etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells see e.g. Loeffler and Behr Meth. Enzymol. 217 599 618 1993 Cohen et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 618 644 1993 Cline Pharmac. Ther. 29 69 92m 1985 and may be used in accordance with the present invention provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.

The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells e.g. hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect patient state etc. and can be determined by one skilled in the art.

Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired available cell type and include but are not limited to epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes fibroblasts muscle cells hepatocytes blood cells such as Tlymphocytes Blymphocytes monocytes macrophages neutrophils eosinophils megakaryocytes granulocytes various stem or progenitor cells in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells e.g. as obtained from bone marrow umbilical cord blood peripheral blood fetal liver etc.

In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention see e.g. PCT Publication WO 94 08598 Stemple and Anderson Cell 71 973 985 1992 Rheinwald Meth. Cell Bio. 21A 229 1980 and Pittelkow and Scott Mayo Clinic Proc. 61 771 1986 .

Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills capsules powders sustained release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound preferably in purified form together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.

In a preferred embodiment the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form for example as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.

The compounds of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric phosphoric acetic oxalic tartaric acids etc. and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium potassium ammonium calcium ferric hydroxides isopropylamine triethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine etc.

The amount of the compound of the invention which will be effective in the treatment inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and the seriousness of the disease or disorder and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.

For antibodies the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg kg to 100 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Preferably the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg kg and 20 mg kg of the patient s body weight more preferably 1 mg kg to 10 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Generally human antibodies have a longer half life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration e.g. into the brain of the antibodies by modifications such as for example lipidation.

The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container s can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture use or sale for human administration.

Labeled antibodies and derivatives and analogs thereof which specifically bind to a polypeptide of interest can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect diagnose or monitor diseases disorders and or conditions associated with the aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention. The invention provides for the detection of aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest comprising a assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and b comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of aberrant expression.

The invention provides a diagnostic assay for diagnosing a disorder comprising a assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and b comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a particular disorder. With respect to cancer the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.

Antibodies of the invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art e.g. see Jalkanen et al. J. Cell. Biol. 101 976 985 1985 Jalkanen et al. J. Cell. Biol. 105 3087 3096 1987 . Other antibody based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and the radioimmunoassay RIA . Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels such as glucose oxidase radioisotopes such as iodine 125I 121I carbon 14C sulfur 35S tritium 3H indium 112In and technetium 99Tc luminescent labels such as luminol and fluorescent labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine and biotin.

One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest in an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment diagnosis comprises a administering for example parenterally subcutaneously or intraperitoneally to a subject an effective amount of a labeled molecule which specifically binds to the polypeptide of interest b waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where the polypeptide is expressed and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level c determining background level and d detecting the labeled molecule in the subject such that detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of the polypeptide of interest. Background level can be determined by various methods including comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.

It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety for a human subject the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99 mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al. Immunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments. Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes eds. Masson Publishing Inc. 1982 .

Depending on several variables including the type of label used and the mode of administration the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.

In an embodiment monitoring of the disease or disorder is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease or disease for example one month after initial diagnosis six months after initial diagnosis one year after initial diagnosis etc.

Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include but are not limited to computed tomography CT whole body scan such as position emission tomography PET magnetic resonance imaging MRI and sonography.

In a specific embodiment the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument Thurston et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 441 050 . In another embodiment the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patent using positron emission tomography. In yet another embodiment the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging MRI .

The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment a kit comprises an antibody of the invention preferably a purified antibody in one or more containers. In a specific embodiment the kits of the present invention contain a substantially isolated polypeptide comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with an antibody included in the kit. Preferably the kits of the present invention further comprise a control antibody which does not react with the polypeptide of interest. In another specific embodiment the kits of the present invention contain a means for detecting the binding of an antibody to a polypeptide of interest e.g. the antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate such as a fluorescent compound an enzymatic substrate a radioactive compound or a luminescent compound or a second antibody which recognizes the first antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate .

In another specific embodiment of the present invention the kit is a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antibodies specific against proliferative and or cancerous polynucleotides and polypeptides. Such a kit may include a control antibody that does not react with the polypeptide of interest. Such a kit may include a substantially isolated polypeptide antigen comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with at least one anti polypeptide antigen antibody. Further such a kit includes means for detecting the binding of said antibody to the antigen e.g. the antibody may be conjugated to a fluorescent compound such as fluorescein or rhodamine which can be detected by flow cytometry . In specific embodiments the kit may include a recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized polypeptide antigen. The polypeptide antigen of the kit may also be attached to a solid support.

In a more specific embodiment the detecting means of the above described kit includes a solid support to which said polypeptide antigen is attached. Such a kit may also include a non attached reporter labeled anti human antibody. In this embodiment binding of the antibody to the polypeptide antigen can be detected by binding of the said reporter labeled antibody.

In an additional embodiment the invention includes a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antigens of the polypeptide of the invention. The diagnostic kit includes a substantially isolated antibody specifically immunoreactive with polypeptide or polynucleotide antigens and means for detecting the binding of the polynucleotide or polypeptide antigen to the antibody. In one embodiment the antibody is attached to a solid support. In a specific embodiment the antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The detecting means of the kit may include a second labeled monoclonal antibody. Alternatively or in addition the detecting means may include a labeled competing antigen.

In one diagnostic configuration test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having a surface bound antigen obtained by the methods of the present invention. After binding with specific antigen antibody to the reagent and removing unbound serum components by washing the reagent is reacted with reporter labeled anti human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti antigen antibody on the solid support. The reagent is again washed to remove unbound labeled antibody and the amount of reporter associated with the reagent is determined. Typically the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric luminescent or colorimetric substrate Sigma St. Louis Mo. .

The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material such as polymeric beads dip sticks 96 well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein typically through a free amine group to a chemically reactive group on the solid support such as an activated carboxyl hydroxyl or aldehyde group. Alternatively streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen s .

Thus the invention provides an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface bound recombinant antigens and a reporter labeled anti human antibody for detecting surface bound anti antigen antibody.

Any polypeptide of the present invention can be used to generate fusion proteins. For example the polypeptide of the present invention when fused to a second protein can be used as an antigenic tag. Antibodies raised against the polypeptide of the present invention can be used to indirectly detect the second protein by binding to the polypeptide. Moreover because certain proteins target cellular locations based on trafficking signals the polypeptides of the present invention can be used as targeting molecules once fused to other proteins.

Examples of domains that can be fused to polypeptides of the present invention include not only heterologous signal sequences but also other heterologous functional regions. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct but may occur through linker sequences.

Moreover fusion proteins may also be engineered to improve characteristics of the polypeptide of the present invention. For instance a region of additional amino acids particularly charged amino acids may be added to the N terminus of the polypeptide to improve stability and persistence during purification from the host cell or subsequent handling and storage. Peptide moieties may be added to the polypeptide to facilitate purification. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide. Similarly peptide cleavage sites can be introduced in between such peptide moieties which could additionally be subjected to protease activity to remove said peptide s from the protein of the present invention. The addition of peptide moieties including peptide cleavage sites to facilitate handling of polypeptides are familiar and routine techniques in the art.

Moreover polypeptides of the present invention including fragments and specifically epitopes can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins IgA IgE IgG IgM or portions thereof CH1 CH2 CH3 and any combination thereof including both entire domains and portions thereof resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half life in vivo. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. EP A 394 827 Traunecker et al. Nature 331 84 86 1988 . Fusion proteins having disulfide linked dimeric structures due to the IgG can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. Fountoulakis et al. J. Biochem. 270 3958 3964 1995 . 

Similarly EP A O 464 533 Canadian counterpart 2045869 discloses fusion proteins comprising various portions of the constant region of immunoglobulin molecules together with another human protein or part thereof. In many cases the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis and thus can result in for example improved pharmacokinetic properties. EP A 0232 262. Alternatively deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed detected and purified would be desired. For example the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery for example human proteins such as hIL 5 have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL 5. See D. Bennett et al. J. Molecular Recognition 8 52 58 1995 K. Johanson et al. J. Biol. Chem. 270 9459 9471 1995 . 

Moreover the polypeptides of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences also referred to as tags . Due to the availability of antibodies specific to such tags purification of the fused polypeptide of the invention and or its identification is significantly facilitated since antibodies specific to the polypeptides of the invention are not required. Such purification may be in the form of an affinity purification whereby an anti tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix e.g. anti tag antibody attached to the matrix of a flow thru column that binds to the epitope tag is present. In preferred embodiments the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector QIAGEN Inc. 9259 Eton Avenue Chatsworth Calif. 91311 among others many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 821 824 1989 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Another peptide tag useful for purification the HA tag corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein. Wilson et al. Cell 37 767 1984 .

The skilled artisan would acknowledge the existence of other tags which could be readily substituted for the tags referred to supra for purification and or identification of polypeptides of the present invention Jones C. et al. J Chromatogr A. 707 1 3 22 1995 . For example the c myc tag and the 8F9 3C7 6E10 G4m B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto Evan et al. Molecular and Cellular Biology 5 3610 3616 1985 the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D gD tag and its antibody Paborsky et al.

USA 87 6363 6397 1990 the FITC epitope Zymed Inc. the GFP epitope Zymed Inc. and the Rhodamine epitope Zymed Inc. .

The present invention also encompasses the attachment of up to nine codons encoding a repeating series of up to nine arginine amino acids to the coding region of a polynucleotide of the present invention. The invention also encompasses chemically derivitizing a polypeptide of the present invention with a repeating series of up to nine arginine amino acids. Such a tag when attached to a polypeptide has recently been shown to serve as a universal pass allowing compounds access to the interior of cells without additional derivitization or manipulation Wender P. et al. unpublished data .

Protein fusions involving polypeptides of the present invention including fragments and or variants thereof can be used for the following non limiting examples subcellular localization of proteins determination of protein protein interactions via immunoprecipitation purification of proteins via affinity chromatography functional and or structural characterization of protein. The present invention also encompasses the application of hapten specific antibodies for any of the uses referenced above for epitope fusion proteins. For example the polypeptides of the present invention could be chemically derivatized to attach hapten molecules e.g. DNP Zymed Inc. . Due to the availability of monoclonal antibodies specific to such haptens the protein could be readily purified using immunoprecipation for example.

Polypeptides of the present invention including fragments and or variants thereof in addition to antibodies directed against such polypeptides fragments and or variants may be fused to any of a number of known and yet to be determined toxins such as ricin saporin Mashiba H et al. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1999 886 233 5 or HC toxin Tonukari N J et al. Plant Cell. 2000 February 12 2 237 248 for example. Such fusions could be used to deliver the toxins to desired tissues for which a ligand or a protein capable of binding to the polypeptides of the invention exists.

The invention encompasses the fusion of antibodies directed against polypeptides of the present invention including variants and fragments thereof to said toxins for delivering the toxin to specific locations in a cell to specific tissues and or to specific species. Such bifunctional antibodies are known in the art though a review describing additional advantageous fusions including citations for methods of production can be found in P. J. Hudson Curr. Opp. In. 1 mm. 11 548 557 1999 this publication in addition to the references cited therein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. In this context the term toxin may be expanded to include any heterologous protein a small molecule radionucleotides cytotoxic drugs liposomes adhesion molecules glycoproteins ligands cell or tissue specific ligands enzymes of bioactive agents biological response modifiers anti fungal agents hormones steroids vitamins peptides peptide analogs anti allergenic agents anti tubercular agents anti viral agents antibiotics anti protozoan agents chelates radioactive particles radioactive ions X ray contrast agents monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies and genetic material. In view of the present disclosure one skilled in the art could determine whether any particular toxin could be used in the compounds of the present invention. Examples of suitable toxins listed above are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the toxins that may be used in the present invention.

Thus any of these above fusions can be engineered using the polynucleotides or the polypeptides of the present invention.

The present invention also relates to vectors containing the polynucleotide of the present invention host cells and the production of polypeptides by recombinant techniques. The vector may be for example a phage plasmid viral or retroviral vector. Retroviral vectors may be replication competent or replication defective. In the latter case viral propagation generally will occur only in complementing host cells.

The polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for propagation in a host. Generally a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate such as a calcium phosphate precipitate or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus it may be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells.

The polynucleotide insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter such as the phage lambda PL promoter the lac trp phoA and tac promoters the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs to name a few. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan. The expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation termination and in the transcribed region a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating codon at the beginning and a termination codon UAA UGA or UAG appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated.

As indicated the expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase G418 or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in and other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include but are not limited to bacterial cells such as and cells fungal cells such as yeast cells e.g. or ATCC Accession No. 201178 insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 cells animal cells such as CHO COS 293 and Bowes melanoma cells and plant cells. Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above described host cells are known in the art.

Among vectors preferred for use in bacteria include pQE70 pQE60 and pQE 9 available from QIAGEN Inc. PBLUESCRIPT vectors Phagescript vectors pNH8A pNH16a pNH18A pNH46A available from Stratagene Cloning Systems Inc. and ptrc99a pKK223 3 pKK233 3 pDR540 pRIT5 available from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are pWLNEO pSV2CAT pOG44 pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene and pSVK3 pBPV pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia. Preferred expression vectors for use in yeast systems include but are not limited to pYES2 pYD1 pTEF1 Zeo pYES2 GS pPICZ pGAPZ pGAPZalph pPIC9 pPIC3.5 pHIL D2 pHIL S1 pPIC3.5K pPIC9K and PAO815 all available from Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.

Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection DEAE dextran mediated transfection cationic lipid mediated transfection electroporation transduction infection or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals such as Davis et al. Basic Methods In Molecular Biology 1986 . It is specifically contemplated that the polypeptides of the present invention may in fact be expressed by a host cell lacking a recombinant vector.

A polypeptide of this invention can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by well known methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation acid extraction anion or cation exchange chromatography phosphocellulose chromatography hydrophobic interaction chromatography affinity chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably high performance liquid chromatography HPLC is employed for purification.

Polypeptides of the present invention and preferably the secreted form can also be recovered from products purified from natural sources including bodily fluids tissues and cells whether directly isolated or cultured products of chemical synthetic procedures and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host including for example bacterial yeast higher plant insect and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or may be non glycosylated. In addition polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue in some cases as a result of host mediated processes. Thus it is well known in the art that the N terminal methionine encoded by the translation initiation codon generally is removed with high efficiency from any protein after translation in all eukaryotic cells. While the N terminal methionine on most proteins also is efficiently removed in most prokaryotes for some proteins this prokaryotic removal process is inefficient depending on the nature of the amino acid to which the N terminal methionine is covalently linked.

In one embodiment the yeast is used to express the polypeptide of the present invention in a eukaryotic system. is a methylotrophic yeast which can metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source. A main step in the methanol metabolization pathway is the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde using O2. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol oxidase. In order to metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source must generate high levels of alcohol oxidase due in part to the relatively low affinity of alcohol oxidase for O2. Consequently in a growth medium depending on methanol as a main carbon source the promoter region of one of the two alcohol oxidase genes AOX1 is highly active. In the presence of methanol alcohol oxidase produced from the AOX1 gene comprises up to approximately 30 of the total soluble protein in . See Ellis S. B. et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 5 1111 21 1985 Koutz P. J et al. Yeast 5 167 77 1989 Tschopp J. F. et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 15 3859 76 1987 . Thus a heterologous coding sequence such as for example a polynucleotide of the present invention under the transcriptional regulation of all or part of the AOX1 regulatory sequence is expressed at exceptionally high levels in yeast grown in the presence of methanol.

In one example the plasmid vector pPIC9K is used to express DNA encoding a polypeptide of the invention as set forth herein in a Pichea yeast system essentially as described in Protocols Methods in Molecular Biology D. R. Higgins and J. Cregg eds. The Humana Press Totowa N.J. 1998. This expression vector allows expression and secretion of a protein of the invention by virtue of the strong AOX1 promoter linked to the alkaline phosphatase PHO secretory signal peptide i.e. leader located upstream of a multiple cloning site.

Many other yeast vectors could be used in place of pPIC9K such as pYES2 pYD1 pTEF1 Zeo pYES2 GS pPICZ pGAPZ pGAPZalpha pPIC9 pPIC3.5 pHIL D2 pHIL S1 pPIC3.5K and PAO815 as one skilled in the art would readily appreciate as long as the proposed expression construct provides appropriately located signals for transcription translation secretion if desired and the like including an in frame AUG as required.

In another embodiment high level expression of a heterologous coding sequence such as for example a polynucleotide of the present invention may be achieved by cloning the heterologous polynucleotide of the invention into an expression vector such as for example pGAPZ or pGAPZalpha and growing the yeast culture in the absence of methanol.

In addition to encompassing host cells containing the vector constructs discussed herein the invention also encompasses primary secondary and immortalized host cells of vertebrate origin particularly mammalian origin that have been engineered to delete or replace endogenous genetic material e.g. coding sequence and or to include genetic material e.g. heterologous polynucleotide sequences that is operably associated with the polynucleotides of the invention and which activates alters and or amplifies endogenous polynucleotides. For example techniques known in the art may be used to operably associate heterologous control regions e.g. promoter and or enhancer and endogenous polynucleotide sequences via homologous recombination resulting in the formation of a new transcription unit see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 670 issued Jun. 24 1997 U.S. Pat. No. 5 733 761 issued Mar. 31 1998 International Publication No. WO 96 29411 published Sep. 26 1996 International Publication No. WO 94 12650 published Aug. 4 1994 Koller et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 and Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties .

In addition polypeptides of the invention can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art e.g. see Creighton 1983 Proteins Structures and Molecular Principles W.H. Freeman Co. N.Y. and Hunkapiller et al. Nature 310 105 111 1984 . For example a polypeptide corresponding to a fragment of a polypeptide sequence of the invention can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore if desired nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the polypeptide sequence. Non classical amino acids include but are not limited to to the D isomers of the common amino acids 2 4 diaminobutyric acid a amino isobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid Abu 2 amino butyric acid g Abu e Ahx 6 amino hexanoic acid Aib 2 amino isobutyric acid 3 amino propionic acid ornithine norleucine norvaline hydroxyproline sarcosine citrulline homocitrulline cysteic acid t butylglycine t butylalanine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine b alanine fluoro amino acids designer amino acids such as b methyl amino acids Ca methyl amino acids Na methyl amino acids and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore the amino acid can be D dextrorotary or L levorotary .

The invention encompasses polypeptides which are differentially modified during or after translation e.g. by glycosylation acetylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide trypsin chymotrypsin papain V8 protease NaBH4 acetylation formylation oxidation reduction metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin etc.

Additional post translational modifications encompassed by the invention include for example e.g. N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains processing of N terminal or C terminal ends attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone chemical modifications of N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains and addition or deletion of an N terminal methionine residue as a result of prokaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label such as an enzymatic fluorescent isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein the addition of epitope tagged peptide fragments e.g. FLAG HA GST thioredoxin maltose binding protein etc. attachment of affinity tags such as biotin and or streptavidin the covalent attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone N or C terminal processing of the polypeptides ends e.g. proteolytic processing deletion of the N terminal methionine residue etc.

Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of the polypeptides of the invention which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility stability and circulating time of the polypeptide or decreased immunogenicity see U.S. Pat. No. 4 179 337 . The chemical moieties for derivitization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol ethylene glycol propylene glycol copolymers carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one two three or more attached chemical moieties.

The invention further encompasses chemical derivitization of the polypeptides of the present invention preferably where the chemical is a hydrophilic polymer residue. Exemplary hydrophilic polymers including derivatives may be those that include polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more hydroxy groups polyhydroxy polymers including for example poly vinyl alcohol polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more amino groups polyamine polymers including for example peptides polypeptides proteins and lipoproteins such as albumin and natural lipoproteins polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more carboxy groups polycarboxy polymers including for example carboxymethylcellulose alginic acid and salts thereof such as sodium and calcium alginate glycosaminoglycans and salts thereof including salts of hyaluronic acid phosphorylated and sulfonated derivatives of carbohydrates genetic material such as interleukin 2 and interferon and phosphorothioate oligomers and polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more saccharide moieties polysaccharide polymers including for example carbohydrates.

The molecular weight of the hydrophilic polymers may vary and is generally about 50 to about 5 000 000 with polymers having a molecular weight of about 100 to about 50 000 being preferred. The polymers may be branched or unbranched. More preferred polymers have a molecular weight of about 150 to about 10 000 with molecular weights of 200 to about 8 000 being even more preferred.

For polyethylene glycol the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa the term about indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol some molecules will weigh more some less than the stated molecular weight for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used depending on the desired therapeutic profile e.g. the duration of sustained release desired the effects if any on biological activity the ease in handling the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog .

Additional preferred polymers which may be used to derivatize polypeptides of the invention include for example poly ethylene glycol PEG poly vinylpyrrolidine polyoxomers polysorbate and poly vinyl alcohol with PEG polymers being particularly preferred. Preferred among the PEG polymers are PEG polymers having a molecular weight of from about 100 to about 10 000. More preferably the PEG polymers have a molecular weight of from about 200 to about 8 000 with PEG 2 000 PEG 5 000 and PEG 8 000 which have molecular weights of 2 000 5 000 and 8 000 respectively being even more preferred. Other suitable hydrophilic polymers in addition to those exemplified above will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure. Generally the polymers used may include polymers that can be attached to the polypeptides of the invention via alkylation or acylation reactions.

The polyethylene glycol molecules or other chemical moieties should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art e.g. EP 0 401 384 herein incorporated by reference coupling PEG to G CSF see also Malik et al. Exp. Hematol. 20 1028 1035 1992 reporting pegylation of GM CSF using tresyl chloride . For example polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group such as a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N terminal amino acid residues those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C terminal amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group such as attachment at the N terminus or lysine group.

One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules by molecular weight branching etc. the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein polypeptide molecules in the reaction mix the type of pegylation reaction to be performed and the method of obtaining the selected N terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N terminally pegylated preparation i.e. separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary may be by purification of the N terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups lysine versus the N terminus available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.

As with the various polymers exemplified above it is contemplated that the polymeric residues may contain functional groups in addition for example to those typically involved in linking the polymeric residues to the polypeptides of the present invention. Such functionalities include for example carboxyl amine hydroxy and thiol groups. These functional groups on the polymeric residues can be further reacted if desired with materials that are generally reactive with such functional groups and which can assist in targeting specific tissues in the body including for example diseased tissue. Exemplary materials which can be reacted with the additional functional groups include for example proteins including antibodies carbohydrates peptides glycopeptides glycolipids lectins and nucleosides.

Exemplary saccharides which can be derived include for example monosaccharides or sugar alcohols such as erythrose threose ribose arabinose xylose lyxose fructose sorbitol mannitol and sedoheptulose with preferred monosaccharides being fructose mannose xylose arabinose mannitol and sorbitol and disaccharides such as lactose sucrose maltose and cellobiose. Other saccharides include for example inositol and ganglioside head groups. Other suitable saccharides in addition to those exemplified above will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure. Generally saccharides which may be used for derivitization include saccharides that can be attached to the polypeptides of the invention via alkylation or acylation reactions.

Polymers useful as stabilizing materials may be of natural semi synthetic modified natural or synthetic origin. Exemplary natural polymers include naturally occurring polysaccharides such as for example arabinans fructans fucans galactans galacturonans glucans mannans xylans such as for example inulin levan fucoidan carrageenan galatocarolose pectic acid pectins including amylose pullulan glycogen amylopectin cellulose dextran dextrin dextrose glucose polyglucose polydextrose pustulan chitin agarose keratin chondroitin dermatan hyaluronic acid alginic acid xanthin gum starch and various other natural homopolymer or heteropolymers such as those containing one or more of the following aldoses ketoses acids or amines erythose threose ribose arabinose xylose lyxose allose altrose glucose dextrose mannose gulose idose galactose talose erythrulose ribulose xylulose psicose fructose sorbose tagatose mannitol sorbitol lactose sucrose trehalose maltose cellobiose glycine serine threonine cysteine tyrosine asparagine glutamine aspartic acid glutamic acid lysine arginine histidine glucuronic acid gluconic acid glucaric acid gal acturonic acid mannuronic acid glucosamine galactosamine and neuraminic acid and naturally occurring derivatives thereof.

Moreover the invention encompasses additional modifications of the polypeptides of the present invention. Such additional modifications are known in the art and are specifically provided in addition to methods of derivitization etc. in U.S. Pat. No. 6 028 066 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety herein.

The polypeptides of the invention may be in monomers or multimers i.e. dimers trimers tetramers and higher multimers . Accordingly the present invention relates to monomers and multimers of the polypeptides of the invention their preparation and compositions preferably Therapeutics containing them. In specific embodiments the polypeptides of the invention are monomers dimers trimers or tetramers. In additional embodiments the multimers of the invention are at least dimers at least trimers or at least tetramers.

Multimers encompassed by the invention may be homomers or heteromers. As used herein the term homomer refers to a multimer containing only polypeptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 or encoded by the cDNA contained in a deposited clone including fragments variants splice variants and fusion proteins corresponding to these polypeptides as described herein . These homomers may contain polypeptides having identical or different amino acid sequences. In a specific embodiment a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing only polypeptides having an identical amino acid sequence. In another specific embodiment a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing polypeptides having different amino acid sequences. In specific embodiments the multimer of the invention is a homodimer e.g. containing polypeptides having identical or different amino acid sequences or a homotrimer e.g. containing polypeptides having identical and or different amino acid sequences . In additional embodiments the homomeric multimer of the invention is at least a homodimer at least a homotrimer or at least a homotetramer.

As used herein the term heteromer refers to a multimer containing one or more heterologous polypeptides i.e. polypeptides of different proteins in addition to the polypeptides of the invention. In a specific embodiment the multimer of the invention is a heterodimer a heterotrimer or a heterotetramer. In additional embodiments the heteromeric multimer of the invention is at least a heterodimer at least a heterotrimer or at least a heterotetramer.

Multimers of the invention may be the result of hydrophobic hydrophilic ionic and or covalent associations and or may be indirectly linked by for example liposome formation. Thus in one embodiment multimers of the invention such as for example homodimers or homotrimers are formed when polypeptides of the invention contact one another in solution. In another embodiment heteromultimers of the invention such as for example heterotrimers or heterotetramers are formed when polypeptides of the invention contact antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention including antibodies to the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein of the invention in solution. In other embodiments multimers of the invention are formed by covalent associations with and or between the polypeptides of the invention. Such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide sequence e.g. that recited in the sequence listing or contained in the polypeptide encoded by a deposited clone . In one instance the covalent associations are cross linking between cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequences which interact in the native i.e. naturally occurring polypeptide. In another instance the covalent associations are the consequence of chemical or recombinant manipulation. Alternatively such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein of the invention.

In one example covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a fusion protein of the invention see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 . In a specific example the covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in an Fc fusion protein of the invention as described herein . In another specific example covalent associations of fusion proteins of the invention are between heterologous polypeptide sequence from another protein that is capable of forming covalently associated multimers such as for example osteoprotegerin see e.g. International Publication NO WO 98 49305 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In another embodiment two or more polypeptides of the invention are joined through peptide linkers. Examples include those peptide linkers described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 073 627 hereby incorporated by reference . Proteins comprising multiple polypeptides of the invention separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology.

Another method for preparing multimer polypeptides of the invention involves use of polypeptides of the invention fused to a leucine zipper or isoleucine zipper polypeptide sequence. Leucine zipper and isoleucine zipper domains are polypeptides that promote multimerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA binding proteins Landschulz et al. Science 240 1759 1988 and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble multimeric proteins of the invention are those described in PCT application WO 94 10308 hereby incorporated by reference. Recombinant fusion proteins comprising a polypeptide of the invention fused to a polypeptide sequence that dimerizes or trimerizes in solution are expressed in suitable host cells and the resulting soluble multimeric fusion protein is recovered from the culture supernatant using techniques known in the art.

Trimeric polypeptides of the invention may offer the advantage of enhanced biological activity. Preferred leucine zipper moieties and isoleucine moieties are those that preferentially form trimers. One example is a leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D SPD as described in Hoppe et al. FEBS Letters 344 191 1994 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08 446 922 hereby incorporated by reference. Other peptides derived from naturally occurring trimeric proteins may be employed in preparing trimeric polypeptides of the invention.

In another example proteins of the invention are associated by interactions between FLAG polypeptide sequence contained in fusion proteins of the invention containing FLAG polypeptide sequence. In a further embodiment associations proteins of the invention are associated by interactions between heterologous polypeptide sequence contained in FLAG fusion proteins of the invention and anti FLAG antibody.

The multimers of the invention may be generated using chemical techniques known in the art. For example polypeptides desired to be contained in the multimers of the invention may be chemically cross linked using linker molecules and linker molecule length optimization techniques known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Additionally multimers of the invention may be generated using techniques known in the art to form one or more inter molecule cross links between the cysteine residues located within the sequence of the polypeptides desired to be contained in the multimer see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Further polypeptides of the invention may be routinely modified by the addition of cysteine or biotin to the C terminus or N terminus of the polypeptide and techniques known in the art may be applied to generate multimers containing one or more of these modified polypeptides see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Additionally techniques known in the art may be applied to generate liposomes containing the polypeptide components desired to be contained in the multimer of the invention see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Alternatively multimers of the invention may be generated using genetic engineering techniques known in the art. In one embodiment polypeptides contained in multimers of the invention are produced recombinantly using fusion protein technology described herein or otherwise known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In a specific embodiment polynucleotides coding for a homodimer of the invention are generated by ligating a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention to a sequence encoding a linker polypeptide and then further to a synthetic polynucleotide encoding the translated product of the polypeptide in the reverse orientation from the original C terminus to the N terminus lacking the leader sequence see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In another embodiment recombinant techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are applied to generate recombinant polypeptides of the invention which contain a transmembrane domain or hydrophobic or signal peptide and which can be incorporated by membrane reconstitution techniques into liposomes see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

In addition the polynucleotide insert of the present invention could be operatively linked to artificial or chimeric promoters and transcription factors. Specifically the artificial promoter could comprise or alternatively consist of any combination of cis acting DNA sequence elements that are recognized by trans acting transcription factors. Preferably the cis acting DNA sequence elements and trans acting transcription factors are operable in mammals. Further the trans acting transcription factors of such artificial promoters could also be artificial or chimeric in design themselves and could act as activators or repressors to said artificial promoter.

Each of the polynucleotides identified herein can be used in numerous ways as reagents. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques.

The polynucleotides of the present invention are useful for chromosome identification. There exists an ongoing need to identify new chromosome markers since few chromosome marking reagents based on actual sequence data repeat polymorphisms are presently available. Each polynucleotide of the present invention can be used as a chromosome marker.

Briefly sequences can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers preferably 15 25 bp from the sequences shown in SEQ ID NO 1. Primers can be selected using computer analysis so that primers do not span more than one predicted exon in the genomic DNA. These primers are then used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes. Only those hybrids containing the human gene corresponding to the SEQ ID NO 1 will yield an amplified fragment.

Similarly somatic hybrids provide a rapid method of PCR mapping the polynucleotides to particular chromosomes. Three or more clones can be assigned per day using a single thermal cycler. Moreover sublocalization of the polynucleotides can be achieved with panels of specific chromosome fragments. Other gene mapping strategies that can be used include in situ hybridization prescreening with labeled flow sorted chromosomes and preselection by hybridization to construct chromosome specific cDNA libraries.

Precise chromosomal location of the polynucleotides can also be achieved using fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH of a metaphase chromosomal spread. This technique uses polynucleotides as short as 500 or 600 bases however polynucleotides 2 000 4 000 bp are preferred. For a review of this technique see Verma et al. Human Chromosomes a Manual of Basic Techniques Pergamon Press New York 1988 .

For chromosome mapping the polynucleotides can be used individually to mark a single chromosome or a single site on that chromosome or in panels for marking multiple sites and or multiple chromosomes . Preferred polynucleotides correspond to the noncoding regions of the cDNAs because the coding sequences are more likely conserved within gene families thus increasing the chance of cross hybridization during chromosomal mapping.

Once a polynucleotide has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location the physical position of the polynucleotide can be used in linkage analysis. Linkage analysis establishes coinheritance between a chromosomal location and presentation of a particular disease. Disease mapping data are known in the art. Assuming 1 megabase mapping resolution and one gene per 20 kb a cDNA precisely localized to a chromosomal region associated with the disease could be one of 50 500 potential causative genes.

Thus once coinheritance is established differences in the polynucleotide and the corresponding gene between affected and unaffected organisms can be examined. First visible structural alterations in the chromosomes such as deletions or translocations are examined in chromosome spreads or by PCR. If no structural alterations exist the presence of point mutations are ascertained. Mutations observed in some or all affected organisms but not in normal organisms indicates that the mutation may cause the disease. However complete sequencing of the polypeptide and the corresponding gene from several normal organisms is required to distinguish the mutation from a polymorphism. If a new polymorphism is identified this polymorphic polypeptide can be used for further linkage analysis.

Furthermore increased or decreased expression of the gene in affected organisms as compared to unaffected organisms can be assessed using polynucleotides of the present invention. Any of these alterations altered expression chromosomal rearrangement or mutation can be used as a diagnostic or prognostic marker.

Thus the invention also provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a disorder involving measuring the expression level of polynucleotides of the present invention in cells or body fluid from an organism and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard level of polynucleotide expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is indicative of a disorder.

By measuring the expression level of a polynucleotide of the present invention is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the polypeptide of the present invention or the level of the mRNA encoding the polypeptide in a first biological sample either directly e.g. by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level or relatively e.g. by comparing to the polypeptide level or mRNA level in a second biological sample . Preferably the polypeptide level or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard polypeptide level or mRNA level the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of organisms not having a disorder. As will be appreciated in the art once a standard polypeptide level or mRNA level is known it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.

By biological sample is intended any biological sample obtained from an organism body fluids cell line tissue culture or other source which contains the polypeptide of the present invention or mRNA. As indicated biological samples include body fluids such as the following non limiting examples sputum amniotic fluid urine saliva breast milk secretions interstitial fluid blood serum spinal fluid etc. which contain the polypeptide of the present invention and other tissue sources found to express the polypeptide of the present invention. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from organisms are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.

The method s provided above may Preferably be applied in a diagnostic method and or kits in which polynucleotides and or polypeptides are attached to a solid support. In one exemplary method the support may be a gene chip or a biological chip as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 837 832 5 874 219 and 5 856 174. Further such a gene chip with polynucleotides of the present invention attached may be used to identify polymorphisms between the polynucleotide sequences with polynucleotides isolated from a test subject. The knowledge of such polymorphisms i.e. their location as well as their existence would be beneficial in identifying disease loci for many disorders including proliferative diseases and conditions. Such a method is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 858 659 and 5 856 104. The US patents referenced supra are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.

The present invention encompasses polynucleotides of the present invention that are chemically synthesized or reproduced as peptide nucleic acids PNA or according to other methods known in the art. The use of PNAs would serve as the preferred form if the polynucleotides are incorporated onto a solid support or gene chip. For the purposes of the present invention a peptide nucleic acid PNA is a polyamide type of DNA analog and the monomeric units for adenine guanine thymine and cytosine are available commercially Perceptive Biosystems . Certain components of DNA such as phosphorus phosphorus oxides or deoxyribose derivatives are not present in PNAs. As disclosed by P. E. Nielsen M. Egholm R. H. Berg and O. Buchardt Science 254 1497 1991 and M. Egholm O. Buchardt L. Christensen C. Behrens S. M. Freier D. A. Driver R. H. Berg S. K. Kim B. Norden and P. E. Nielsen Nature 365 666 1993 PNAs bind specifically and tightly to complementary DNA strands and are not degraded by nucleases. In fact PNA binds more strongly to DNA than DNA itself does. This is probably because there is no electrostatic repulsion between the two strands and also the polyamide backbone is more flexible. Because of this PNA DNA duplexes bind under a wider range of stringency conditions than DNA DNA duplexes making it easier to perform multiplex hybridization. Smaller probes can be used than with DNA due to the stronger binding characteristics of PNA DNA hybrids. In addition it is more likely that single base mismatches can be determined with PNA DNA hybridization because a single mismatch in a PNA DNA 15 mer lowers the melting point T.sub.m by 8 20 C. vs. 4 16 C. for the DNA DNA 15 mer duplex. Also the absence of charge groups in PNA means that hybridization can be done at low ionic strengths and reduce possible interference by salt during the analysis.

In addition to the foregoing a polynucleotide can be used to control gene expression through triple helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA. Antisense techniques are discussed for example in Okano J. Neurochem. 56 560 1991 Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Triple helix formation is discussed in for instance Lee et al. Nucleic Acids Research 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. Science 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. Science 251 1360 1991 . Both methods rely on binding of the polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. For these techniques preferred polynucleotides are usually oligonucleotides 20 to 40 bases in length and complementary to either the region of the gene involved in transcription triple helix see Lee et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. Science 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. Science 251 1360 1991 or to the mRNA itself antisense Okano J. Neurochem. 56 560 1991 Oligodeoxy nucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Triple helix formation optimally results in a shut off of RNA transcription from DNA while antisense RNA hybridization blocks translation of an mRNA molecule into polypeptide. Both techniques are effective in model systems and the information disclosed herein can be used to design antisense or triple helix polynucleotides in an effort to treat or prevent disease.

The present invention encompasses the addition of a nuclear localization signal operably linked to the 5 end 3 end or any location therein to any of the oligonucleotides antisense oligonucleotides triple helix oligonucleotides ribozymes PNA oligonucleotides and or polynucleotides of the present invention. See for example G. Cutrona et al. Nat. Biotech. 18 300 303 2000 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Polynucleotides of the present invention are also useful in gene therapy. One goal of gene therapy is to insert a normal gene into an organism having a defective gene in an effort to correct the genetic defect. The polynucleotides disclosed in the present invention offer a means of targeting such genetic defects in a highly accurate manner. Another goal is to insert a new gene that was not present in the host genome thereby producing a new trait in the host cell. In one example polynucleotide sequences of the present invention may be used to construct chimeric RNA DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to said sequences specifically designed to induce host cell mismatch repair mechanisms in an organism upon systemic injection for example Bartlett R. J. et al. Nat. Biotech 18 615 622 2000 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Such RNA DNA oligonucleotides could be designed to correct genetic defects in certain host strains and or to introduce desired phenotypes in the host e.g. introduction of a specific polymorphism within an endogenous gene corresponding to a polynucleotide of the present invention that may ameliorate and or prevent a disease symptom and or disorder etc. . Alternatively the polynucleotide sequence of the present invention may be used to construct duplex oligonucleotides corresponding to said sequence specifically designed to correct genetic defects in certain host strains and or to introduce desired phenotypes into the host e.g. introduction of a specific polymorphism within an endogenous gene corresponding to a polynucleotide of the present invention that may ameliorate and or prevent a disease symptom and or disorder etc . Such methods of using duplex oligonucleotides are known in the art and are encompassed by the present invention see EP1007712 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

The polynucleotides are also useful for identifying organisms from minute biological samples. The United States military for example is considering the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP for identification of its personnel. In this technique an individual s genomic DNA is digested with one or more restriction enzymes and probed on a Southern blot to yield unique bands for identifying personnel. This method does not suffer from the current limitations of Dog Tags which can be lost switched or stolen making positive identification difficult. The polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as additional DNA markers for RFLP.

The polynucleotides of the present invention can also be used as an alternative to RFLP by determining the actual base by base DNA sequence of selected portions of an organisms genome. These sequences can be used to prepare PCR primers for amplifying and isolating such selected DNA which can then be sequenced. Using this technique organisms can be identified because each organism will have a unique set of DNA sequences. Once an unique ID database is established for an organism positive identification of that organism living or dead can be made from extremely small tissue samples. Similarly polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as polymorphic markers in addition to the identification of transformed or non transformed cells and or tissues.

There is also a need for reagents capable of identifying the source of a particular tissue. Such need arises for example when presented with tissue of unknown origin. Appropriate reagents can comprise for example DNA probes or primers specific to particular tissue prepared from the sequences of the present invention. Panels of such reagents can identify tissue by species and or by organ type. In a similar fashion these reagents can be used to screen tissue cultures for contamination. Moreover as mentioned above such reagents can be used to screen and or identify transformed and non transformed cells and or tissues.

In the very least the polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as molecular weight markers on Southern gels as diagnostic probes for the presence of a specific mRNA in a particular cell type as a probe to subtract out known sequences in the process of discovering novel polynucleotides for selecting and making oligomers for attachment to a gene chip or other support to raise anti DNA antibodies using DNA immunization techniques and as an antigen to elicit an immune response.

Each of the polypeptides identified herein can be used in numerous ways. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques.

A polypeptide of the present invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using antibody based techniques. For example protein expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods. Jalkanen M. et al. J. Cell. Biol. 101 976 985 1985 Jalkanen M. et al. J. Cell. Biol. 105 3087 3096 1987 . Other antibody based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and the radioimmunoassay RIA . Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels such as glucose oxidase and radioisotopes such as iodine 125I 121I carbon 14C sulfur 35S tritium 3H indium 112In and technetium 99 mTc and fluorescent labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine and biotin.

In addition to assaying protein levels in a biological sample proteins can also be detected in vivo by imaging. Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of protein include those detectable by X radiography NMR or ESR. For X radiography suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin such as deuterium which may be incorporated into the antibody by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma.

A protein specific antibody or antibody fragment which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety such as a radioisotope for example 131I 112In 99 mTc a radio opaque substance or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance is introduced for example parenterally subcutaneously or intraperitoneally into the mammal. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety for a human subject the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99 mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al. Immunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments. Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes eds. Masson Publishing Inc. 1982 . 

Thus the invention provides a diagnostic method of a disorder which involves a assaying the expression of a polypeptide of the present invention in cells or body fluid of an individual b comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a disorder. With respect to cancer the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.

Moreover polypeptides of the present invention can be used to treat prevent and or diagnose disease. For example patients can be administered a polypeptide of the present invention in an effort to replace absent or decreased levels of the polypeptide e.g. insulin to supplement absent or decreased levels of a different polypeptide e.g. hemoglobin S for hemoglobin B SOD catalase DNA repair proteins to inhibit the activity of a polypeptide e.g. an oncogene or tumor suppressor to activate the activity of a polypeptide e.g. by binding to a receptor to reduce the activity of a membrane bound receptor by competing with it for free ligand e.g. soluble TNF receptors used in reducing inflammation or to bring about a desired response e.g. blood vessel growth inhibition enhancement of the immune response to proliferative cells or tissues .

Similarly antibodies directed to a polypeptide of the present invention can also be used to treat prevent and or diagnose disease. For example administration of an antibody directed to a polypeptide of the present invention can bind and reduce overproduction of the polypeptide. Similarly administration of an antibody can activate the polypeptide such as by binding to a polypeptide bound to a membrane receptor .

At the very least the polypeptides of the present invention can be used as molecular weight markers on SDS PAGE gels or on molecular sieve gel filtration columns using methods well known to those of skill in the art. Polypeptides can also be used to raise antibodies which in turn are used to measure protein expression from a recombinant cell as a way of assessing transformation of the host cell. Moreover the polypeptides of the present invention can be used to test the following biological activities.

Another aspect of the present invention is to gene therapy methods for treating or preventing disorders diseases and conditions. The gene therapy methods relate to the introduction of nucleic acid DNA RNA and antisense DNA or RNA sequences into an animal to achieve expression of a polypeptide of the present invention. This method requires a polynucleotide which codes for a polypeptide of the invention that operatively linked to a promoter and any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the polypeptide by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques are known in the art see for example WO90 11092 which is herein incorporated by reference.

Thus for example cells from a patient may be engineered with a polynucleotide DNA or RNA comprising a promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide of the invention ex vivo with the engineered cells then being provided to a patient to be treated with the polypeptide. Such methods are well known in the art. For example see Belldegrun et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 85 207 216 1993 Ferrantini et al. Cancer Research 53 107 1112 1993 Ferrantini et al. J. Immunology 153 4604 4615 1994 Kaido T. et al. Int. J. Cancer 60 221 229 1995 Ogura et al. Cancer Research 50 5102 5106 1990 Santodonato et al. Human Gene Therapy 7 1 10 1996 Santodonato et al. Gene Therapy 4 1246 1255 1997 and Zhang et al. Cancer Gene Therapy 3 31 38 1996 which are herein incorporated by reference. In one embodiment the cells which are engineered are arterial cells. The arterial cells may be reintroduced into the patient through direct injection to the artery the tissues surrounding the artery or through catheter injection.

As discussed in more detail below the polynucleotide constructs can be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal such as injection into the interstitial space of tissues heart muscle skin lung liver and the like . The polynucleotide constructs may be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.

In one embodiment the polynucleotide of the invention is delivered as a naked polynucleotide. The term naked polynucleotide DNA or RNA refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist promote or facilitate entry into the cell including viral sequences viral particles liposome formulations lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. However the polynucleotides of the invention can also be delivered in liposome formulations and lipofectin formulations and the like can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 593 972 5 589 466 and 5 580 859 which are herein incorporated by reference.

The polynucleotide vector constructs of the invention used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Appropriate vectors include pWLNEO pSV2CAT pOG44 pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene pSVK3 pBPV pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia and pEF1 V5 pcDNA3.1 and pRc CMV2 available from Invitrogen. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.

Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of polynucleotide sequence of the invention. Suitable promoters include adenoviral promoters such as the adenoviral major late promoter or heterologous promoters such as the cytomegalovirus CMV promoter the respiratory syncytial virus RSV promoter inducible promoters such as the MMT promoter the metallothionein promoter heat shock promoters the albumin promoter the ApoAI promoter human globin promoters viral thymidine kinase promoters such as the Herpes Simplex thymidine kinase promoter retroviral LTRs the b actin promoter and human growth hormone promoters. The promoter also may be the native promoter for the polynucleotides of the invention.

Unlike other gene therapy techniques one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.

The polynucleotide construct of the invention can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the an animal including of muscle skin brain lung liver spleen bone marrow thymus heart lymph blood bone cartilage pancreas kidney gall bladder stomach intestine testis ovary uterus rectum nervous system eye gland and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular fluid mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers collagen fibers of fibrous tissues or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent non dividing cells which are differentiated although delivery and expression may be achieved in non differentiated or less completely differentiated cells such as for example stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides.

For the naked nucleic acid sequence injection an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 mg kg body weight to about 50 mg kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg kg to about 20 mg kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg kg to about 5 mg kg. Of course as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration.

The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However other parenteral routes may also be used such as inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition naked DNA constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.

The naked polynucleotides are delivered by any method known in the art including but not limited to direct needle injection at the delivery site intravenous injection topical administration catheter infusion and so called gene guns . These delivery methods are known in the art.

The constructs may also be delivered with delivery vehicles such as viral sequences viral particles liposome formulations lipofectin precipitating agents etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.

In certain embodiments the polynucleotide constructs of the invention are complexed in a liposome preparation. Liposomal preparations for use in the instant invention include cationic positively charged anionic negatively charged and neutral preparations. However cationic liposomes are particularly preferred because a tight charge complex can be formed between the cationic liposome and the polyanionic nucleic acid. Cationic liposomes have been shown to mediate intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA Felgner et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 7413 7416 1987 which is herein incorporated by reference mRNA Malone et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 6077 6081 1989 which is herein incorporated by reference and purified transcription factors Debs et al. J. Biol. Chem. 265 10189 10192 1990 which is herein incorporated by reference in functional form.

Cationic liposomes are readily available. For example N 1 2 3 dioleyloxy propyl N N N triethylammonium DOTMA liposomes are particularly useful and are available under the trademark LIPOFECTIN from GIBCO BRL Grand Island N.Y. See also Felgner et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 7413 7416 1987 which is herein incorporated by reference . Other commercially available liposomes include transfectace DDAB DOPE and DOTAP DOPE Boehringer .

Other cationic liposomes can be prepared from readily available materials using techniques well known in the art. See e.g. PCT Publication NO WO 90 11092 which is herein incorporated by reference for a description of the synthesis of DOTAP 1 2 bis oleoyloxy 3 trimethylammonio propane liposomes. Preparation of DOTMA liposomes is explained in the literature see e.g. Felgner et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 7413 7417 which is herein incorporated by reference. Similar methods can be used to prepare liposomes from other cationic lipid materials.

Similarly anionic and neutral liposomes are readily available such as from Avanti Polar Lipids Birmingham Ala. or can be easily prepared using readily available materials. Such materials include phosphatidyl choline cholesterol phosphatidyl ethanolamine dioleoylphosphatidyl choline DOPC dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol DOPG dioleoylphoshatidyl ethanolamine DOPE among others. These materials can also be mixed with the DOTMA and DOTAP starting materials in appropriate ratios. Methods for making liposomes using these materials are well known in the art.

For example commercially dioleoylphosphatidyl choline DOPC dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol DOPG and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine DOPE can be used in various combinations to make conventional liposomes with or without the addition of cholesterol. Thus for example DOPG DOPC vesicles can be prepared by drying 50 mg each of DOPG and DOPC under a stream of nitrogen gas into a sonication vial. The sample is placed under a vacuum pump overnight and is hydrated the following day with deionized water. The sample is then sonicated for 2 hours in a capped vial using a Heat Systems model 350 sonicator equipped with an inverted cup bath type probe at the maximum setting while the bath is circulated at 15EC. Alternatively negatively charged vesicles can be prepared without sonication to produce multilamellar vesicles or by extrusion through nucleopore membranes to produce unilamellar vesicles of discrete size. Other methods are known and available to those of skill in the art.

The liposomes can comprise multilamellar vesicles MLVs small unilamellar vesicles SUVs or large unilamellar vesicles LUVs with SUVs being preferred. The various liposome nucleic acid complexes are prepared using methods well known in the art. See e.g. Straubinger et al. Methods of Immunology 101 512 527 1983 which is herein incorporated by reference. For example MLVs containing nucleic acid can be prepared by depositing a thin film of phospholipid on the walls of a glass tube and subsequently hydrating with a solution of the material to be encapsulated. SUVs are prepared by extended sonication of MLVs to produce a homogeneous population of unilamellar liposomes. The material to be entrapped is added to a suspension of preformed MLVs and then sonicated. When using liposomes containing cationic lipids the dried lipid film is resuspended in an appropriate solution such as sterile water or an isotonic buffer solution such as 10 mM Tris NaCl sonicated and then the preformed liposomes are mixed directly with the DNA. The liposome and DNA form a very stable complex due to binding of the positively charged liposomes to the cationic DNA. SUVs find use with small nucleic acid fragments. LUVs are prepared by a number of methods well known in the art. Commonly used methods include Ca2 EDTA chelation Papahadjopoulos et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 394 483 1975 Wilson et al. Cell 17 77 1979 ether injection Deamer et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 443 629 1976 Ostro et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 76 836 1977 Fraley et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76 3348 1979 detergent dialysis Enoch et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76 145 1979 and reverse phase evaporation REV Fraley et al. J. Biol. Chem. 255 10431 1980 Szoka et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75 145 1978 Schaefer Ridder et al. Science 215 166 1982 which are herein incorporated by reference.

Generally the ratio of DNA to liposomes will be from about 10 1 to about 1 10. Preferably the ration will be from about 5 1 to about 1 5. More preferably the ration will be about 3 1 to about 1 3. Still more preferably the ratio will be about 1 1.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 589 466 5 693 622 5 580 859 5 703 055 and international publication NO WO 94 9469 which are herein incorporated by reference provide methods for delivering DNA cationic lipid complexes to mammals.

In certain embodiments cells are engineered ex vivo or in vivo using a retroviral particle containing RNA which comprises a sequence encoding polypeptides of the invention. Retroviruses from which the retroviral plasmid vectors may be derived include but are not limited to Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus spleen necrosis virus Rous sarcoma Virus Harvey Sarcoma Virus avian leukosis virus gibbon ape leukemia virus human immunodeficiency virus Myeloproliferative Sarcoma Virus and mammary tumor virus.

The retroviral plasmid vector is employed to transduce packaging cell lines to form producer cell lines. Examples of packaging cells which may be transfected include but are not limited to the PE501 PA317 R 2 R AM PA12 T19 14X VT 19 17 H2 RCRE RCRIP GP E 86 GP envAm12 and DAN cell lines as described in Miller Human Gene Therapy 1 5 14 1990 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The vector may transduce the packaging cells through any means known in the art. Such means include but are not limited to electroporation the use of liposomes and CaPO4 precipitation. In one alternative the retroviral plasmid vector may be encapsulated into a liposome or coupled to a lipid and then administered to a host.

The producer cell line generates infectious retroviral vector particles which include polynucleotide encoding polypeptides of the invention. Such retroviral vector particles then may be employed to transduce eukaryotic cells either in vitro or in vivo. The transduced eukaryotic cells will express polypeptides of the invention.

In certain other embodiments cells are engineered ex vivo or in vivo with polynucleotides of the invention contained in an adenovirus vector. Adenovirus can be manipulated such that it encodes and expresses polypeptides of the invention and at the same time is inactivated in terms of its ability to replicate in a normal lytic viral life cycle. Adenovirus expression is achieved without integration of the viral DNA into the host cell chromosome thereby alleviating concerns about insertional mutagenesis. Furthermore adenoviruses have been used as live enteric vaccines for many years with an excellent safety profile Schwartzet al. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 109 233 238 1974 . Finally adenovirus mediated gene transfer has been demonstrated in a number of instances including transfer of alpha 1 antitrypsin and CFTR to the lungs of cotton rats Rosenfeld et al. Science 252 431 434 1991 Rosenfeld et al. Cell 68 143 155 1992 . Furthermore extensive studies to attempt to establish adenovirus as a causative agent in human cancer were uniformly negative Green et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76 6606 1979 .

Suitable adenoviral vectors useful in the present invention are described for example in Kozarsky and Wilson Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 3 499 503 1993 Rosenfeld et al. Cell 68 143 155 1992 Engelhardt et al. Human Genet. Ther. 4 759 769 1993 Yang et al. Nature Genet. 7 362 369 1994 Wilson et al. Nature 365 691 692 1993 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 652 224 which are herein incorporated by reference. For example the adenovirus vector Ad2 is useful and can be grown in human 293 cells. These cells contain the E1 region of adenovirus and constitutively express E1a and E1b which complement the defective adenoviruses by providing the products of the genes deleted from the vector. In addition to Ad2 other varieties of adenovirus e.g. Ad3 Ad5 and Ad7 are also useful in the present invention.

Preferably the adenoviruses used in the present invention are replication deficient. Replication deficient adenoviruses require the aid of a helper virus and or packaging cell line to form infectious particles. The resulting virus is capable of infecting cells and can express a polynucleotide of interest which is operably linked to a promoter but cannot replicate in most cells. Replication deficient adenoviruses may be deleted in one or more of all or a portion of the following genes E1a E1b E3 E4 E2a or L1 through L5.

In certain other embodiments the cells are engineered ex vivo or in vivo using an adeno associated virus AAV . AAVs are naturally occurring defective viruses that require helper viruses to produce infectious particles Muzyczka Curr. Topics in Microbiol. Immunol. 158 97 1992 . It is also one of the few viruses that may integrate its DNA into non dividing cells. Vectors containing as little as 300 base pairs of AAV can be packaged and can integrate but space for exogenous DNA is limited to about 4.5 kb. Methods for producing and using such AAVs are known in the art. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 139 941 5 173 414 5 354 678 5 436 146 5 474 935 5 478 745 and 5 589 377.

For example an appropriate AAV vector for use in the present invention will include all the sequences necessary for DNA replication encapsidation and host cell integration. The polynucleotide construct containing polynucleotides of the invention is inserted into the AAV vector using standard cloning methods such as those found in Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Press 1989 . The recombinant AAV vector is then transfected into packaging cells which are infected with a helper virus using any standard technique including lipofection electroporation calcium phosphate precipitation etc. Appropriate helper viruses include adenoviruses cytomegaloviruses vaccinia viruses or herpes viruses. Once the packaging cells are transfected and infected they will produce infectious AAV viral particles which contain the polynucleotide construct of the invention. These viral particles are then used to transduce eukaryotic cells either ex vivo or in vivo. The transduced cells will contain the polynucleotide construct integrated into its genome and will express the desired gene product.

Another method of gene therapy involves operably associating heterologous control regions and endogenous polynucleotide sequences e.g. encoding the polypeptide sequence of interest via homologous recombination see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 670 issued Jun. 24 1997 International Publication NO WO 96 29411 published Sep. 26 1996 International Publication NO WO 94 12650 published Aug. 4 1994 Koller et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 and Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 . This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells but which is not normally expressed in the cells or is expressed at a lower level than desired.

Polynucleotide constructs are made using standard techniques known in the art which contain the promoter with targeting sequences flanking the promoter. Suitable promoters are described herein. The targeting sequence is sufficiently complementary to an endogenous sequence to permit homologous recombination of the promoter targeting sequence with the endogenous sequence. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5 end of the desired endogenous polynucleotide sequence so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination.

The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5 and 3 ends. Preferably the 3 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5 end of the amplified promoter and the 5 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3 end of the amplified promoter. The amplified promoter and targeting sequences are digested and ligated together.

The promoter targeting sequence construct is delivered to the cells either as naked polynucleotide or in conjunction with transfection facilitating agents such as liposomes viral sequences viral particles whole viruses lipofection precipitating agents etc. described in more detail above. The P promoter targeting sequence can be delivered by any method included direct needle injection intravenous injection topical administration catheter infusion particle accelerators etc. The methods are described in more detail below.

The promoter targeting sequence construct is taken up by cells. Homologous recombination between the construct and the endogenous sequence takes place such that an endogenous sequence is placed under the control of the promoter. The promoter then drives the expression of the endogenous sequence.

The polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the present invention may be administered along with other polynucleotides encoding angiogenic proteins. Angiogenic proteins include but are not limited to acidic and basic fibroblast tubulin tyrosine ligase proteins VEGF 1 VEGF 2 VEGF C VEGF 3 VEGF B epidermal tubulin tyrosine ligase protein alpha and beta platelet derived endothelial cell tubulin tyrosine ligase protein platelet derived tubulin tyrosine ligase protein tumor necrosis factor alpha hepatocyte tubulin tyrosine ligase protein insulin like tubulin tyrosine ligase protein colony stimulating factor macrophage colony stimulating factor granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and nitric oxide synthase.

Preferably the polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention contains a secretory signal sequence that facilitates secretion of the protein. Typically the signal sequence is positioned in the coding region of the polynucleotide to be expressed towards or at the 5 end of the coding region. The signal sequence may be homologous or heterologous to the polynucleotide of interest and may be homologous or heterologous to the cells to be transfected. Additionally the signal sequence may be chemically synthesized using methods known in the art.

Any mode of administration of any of the above described polynucleotides constructs can be used so long as the mode results in the expression of one or more molecules in an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic effect. This includes direct needle injection systemic injection catheter infusion biolistic injectors particle accelerators i.e. gene guns gelfoam sponge depots other commercially available depot materials osmotic pumps e.g. Alza minipumps oral or suppositorial solid tablet or pill pharmaceutical formulations and decanting or topical applications during surgery. For example direct injection of naked calcium phosphate precipitated plasmid into rat liver and rat spleen or a protein coated plasmid into the portal vein has resulted in gene expression of the foreign gene in the rat livers. Kaneda et al. Science 243 375 1989 .

A preferred method of local administration is by direct injection. Preferably a recombinant molecule of the present invention complexed with a delivery vehicle is administered by direct injection into or locally within the area of arteries. Administration of a composition locally within the area of arteries refers to injecting the composition centimeters and preferably millimeters within arteries.

Another method of local administration is to contact a polynucleotide construct of the present invention in or around a surgical wound. For example a patient can undergo surgery and the polynucleotide construct can be coated on the surface of tissue inside the wound or the construct can be injected into areas of tissue inside the wound.

Therapeutic compositions useful in systemic administration include recombinant molecules of the present invention complexed to a targeted delivery vehicle of the present invention. Suitable delivery vehicles for use with systemic administration comprise liposomes comprising ligands for targeting the vehicle to a particular site.

Preferred methods of systemic administration include intravenous injection aerosol oral and percutaneous topical delivery. Intravenous injections can be performed using methods standard in the art. Aerosol delivery can also be performed using methods standard in the art see for example Stribling et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 189 11277 11281 1992 which is incorporated herein by reference . Oral delivery can be performed by complexing a polynucleotide construct of the present invention to a carrier capable of withstanding degradation by digestive enzymes in the gut of an animal. Examples of such carriers include plastic capsules or tablets such as those known in the art. Topical delivery can be performed by mixing a polynucleotide construct of the present invention with a lipophilic reagent e.g. DMSO that is capable of passing into the skin.

Determining an effective amount of substance to be delivered can depend upon a number of factors including for example the chemical structure and biological activity of the substance the age and weight of the animal the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity and the route of administration. The frequency of treatments depends upon a number of factors such as the amount of polynucleotide constructs administered per dose as well as the health and history of the subject. The precise amount number of doses and timing of doses will be determined by the attending physician or veterinarian. Therapeutic compositions of the present invention can be administered to any animal preferably to mammals and birds. Preferred mammals include humans dogs cats mice rats rabbits sheep cattle horses and pigs with humans being particularly preferred.

The polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention can be used in assays to test for one or more biological activities. If these polynucleotides and polypeptides do exhibit activity in a particular assay it is likely that these molecules may be involved in the diseases associated with the biological activity. Thus the polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists could be used to treat the associated disease.

The polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may be useful in treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases disorders and or conditions of the immune system by activating or inhibiting the proliferation differentiation or mobilization chemotaxis of immune cells. Immune cells develop through a process called hematopoiesis producing myeloid platelets red blood cells neutrophils and macrophages and lymphoid B and T lymphocytes cells from pluripotent stem cells. The etiology of these immune diseases disorders and or conditions may be genetic somatic such as cancer or some autoimmune diseases disorders and or conditions acquired e.g. by chemotherapy or toxins or infectious. Moreover a polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention can be used as a marker or detector of a particular immune system disease or disorder.

A polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may be useful in treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases disorders and or conditions of hematopoietic cells. A polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention could be used to increase differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells including the pluripotent stem cells in an effort to treat or prevent those diseases disorders and or conditions associated with a decrease in certain or many types hematopoietic cells. Examples of immunologic deficiency syndromes include but are not limited to blood protein diseases disorders and or conditions e.g. agammaglobulinemia dysgammaglobulinemia ataxia telangiectasia common variable immunodeficiency Digeorge Syndrome HIV infection HTLV BLV infection leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome lymphopenia phagocyte bactericidal dysfunction severe combined immunodeficiency SCIDs Wiskott Aldrich Disorder anemia thrombocytopenia or hemoglobinuria.

Moreover a polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention could also be used to modulate hemostatic the stopping of bleeding or thrombolytic activity clot formation . For example by increasing hemostatic or thrombolytic activity a polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention could be used to treat or prevent blood coagulation diseases disorders and or conditions e.g. afibrinogenemia factor deficiencies arterial thrombosis venous thrombosis etc. blood platelet diseases disorders and or conditions e.g. thrombocytopenia or wounds resulting from trauma surgery or other causes. Alternatively a polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention that can decrease hemostatic or thrombolytic activity could be used to inhibit or dissolve clotting. Polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention are may also be useful for the detection prognosis treatment and or prevention of heart attacks infarction strokes scarring fibrinolysis uncontrolled bleeding uncontrolled coagulation uncontrolled complement fixation and or inflammation.

A polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may also be useful in treating preventing and or diagnosing autoimmune diseases disorders and or conditions. Many autoimmune diseases disorders and or conditions result from inappropriate recognition of self as foreign material by immune cells. This inappropriate recognition results in an immune response leading to the destruction of the host tissue. Therefore the administration of a polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention that inhibits an immune response particularly the proliferation differentiation or chemotaxis of T cells may be an effective therapy in preventing autoimmune diseases disorders and or conditions.

Examples of autoimmune diseases disorders and or conditions that can be treated prevented and or diagnosed or detected by the present invention include but are not limited to Addison s Disease hemolytic anemia antiphospholipid syndrome rheumatoid arthritis dermatitis allergic encephalomyelitis glomerulonephritis Goodpasture s Syndrome Graves Disease Multiple Sclerosis Myasthenia Gravis Neuritis Ophthalmia Bullous Pemphigoid Pemphigus Polyendocrinopathies Purpura Reiter s Disease Stiff Man Syndrome Autoimmune Thyroiditis Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Autoimmune Pulmonary Inflammation Guillain Barre Syndrome insulin dependent diabetes mellitis and autoimmune inflammatory eye disease.

Similarly allergic reactions and conditions such as asthma particularly allergic asthma or other respiratory problems may also be treated prevented and or diagnosed by polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention. Moreover these molecules can be used to treat anaphylaxis hypersensitivity to an antigenic molecule or blood group incompatibility.

A polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to treat prevent and or diagnose organ rejection or graft versus host disease GVHD . Organ rejection occurs by host immune cell destruction of the transplanted tissue through an immune response. Similarly an immune response is also involved in GVHD but in this case the foreign transplanted immune cells destroy the host tissues. The administration of a polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention that inhibits an immune response particularly the proliferation differentiation or chemotaxis of T cells may be an effective therapy in preventing organ rejection or GVHD.

Similarly a polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to modulate inflammation. For example the polypeptide or polynucleotide or agonists or antagonist may inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of cells involved in an inflammatory response. These molecules can be used to treat prevent and or diagnose inflammatory conditions both chronic and acute conditions including chronic prostatitis granulomatous prostatitis and malacoplakia inflammation associated with infection e.g. septic shock sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome SIRS ischemia reperfusion injury endotoxin lethality arthritis complement mediated hyperacute rejection nephritis cytokine or chemokine induced lung injury inflammatory bowel disease Crohn s disease or resulting from over production of cytokines e.g. TNF or IL 1. 

A polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the invention can be used to treat prevent and or diagnose hyperproliferative diseases disorders and or conditions including neoplasms. A polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may inhibit the proliferation of the disorder through direct or indirect interactions. Alternatively a polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the present invention may proliferate other cells which can inhibit the hyperproliferative disorder.

For example by increasing an immune response particularly increasing antigenic qualities of the hyperproliferative disorder or by proliferating differentiating or mobilizing T cells hyperproliferative diseases disorders and or conditions can be treated prevented and or diagnosed. This immune response may be increased by either enhancing an existing immune response or by initiating a new immune response. Alternatively decreasing an immune response may also be a method of treating preventing and or diagnosing hyperproliferative diseases disorders and or conditions such as a chemotherapeutic agent.

In order to specifically deliver or transfect cells which are abnormally proliferating and spare non dividing cells it is preferable to utilize a retrovirus or adenoviral as described in the art and elsewhere herein delivery system known to those of skill in the art. Since host DNA replication is required for retroviral DNA to integrate and the retrovirus will be unable to self replicate due to the lack of the retrovirus genes needed for its life cycle. Utilizing such a retroviral delivery system for polynucleotides of the present invention will target said gene and constructs to abnormally proliferating cells and will spare the non dividing normal cells.

The naturally occurring balance between endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis is one in which inhibitory influences predominate. Rastinejad et al. Cell 56 345 355 1989 . In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal physiological conditions such as wound healing organ regeneration embryonic development and female reproductive processes angiogenesis is stringently regulated and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis such as that characterizing solid tumor growth these regulatory controls fail. Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many neoplastic and non neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases arthritis some types of eye diseases disorders and or conditions and psoriasis. See e.g. reviews by Moses et al. Biotech. 9 630 634 1991 Folkman et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 333 1757 1763 1995 Auerbach et al. J. Microvasc. Res. 29 401 411 1985 Folkman Advances in Cancer Research eds. Klein and Weinhouse Academic Press New York pp. 175 203 1985 Patz Am. J. Opthalmol. 94 715 743 1982 and Folkman et al. Science 221 719 725 1983 . In a number of pathological conditions the process of angiogenesis contributes to the disease state. For example significant data have accumulated which suggest that the growth of solid tumors is dependent on angiogenesis. Folkman and Klagsbrun Science 235 442 447 1987 .

The present invention provides for treatment of diseases disorders and or conditions associated with neovascularization by administration of the polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention as well as agonists or antagonists of the present invention. Malignant and metastatic conditions which can be treated with the polynucleotides and polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of the invention include but are not limited to malignancies solid tumors and cancers described herein and otherwise known in the art for a review of such disorders see Fishman et al. Medicine 2d Ed. J. B. Lippincott Co. Philadelphia 1985 . Thus the present invention provides a method of treating preventing and or diagnosing an angiogenesis related disease and or disorder comprising administering to an individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a polynucleotide polypeptide antagonist and or agonist of the invention. For example polynucleotides polypeptides antagonists and or agonists may be utilized in a variety of additional methods in order to therapeutically treat or prevent a cancer or tumor.

Within yet other aspects polynucleotides polypeptides antagonists and or agonists may be utilized to treat superficial forms of bladder cancer by for example intravesical administration. Polynucleotides polypeptides antagonists and or agonists may be delivered directly into the tumor or near the tumor site via injection or a catheter. Of course as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate the appropriate mode of administration will vary according to the cancer to be treated. Other modes of delivery are discussed herein.

Polynucleotides polypeptides antagonists and or agonists may be useful in treating preventing and or diagnosing other diseases disorders and or conditions besides cancers which involve angiogenesis. These diseases disorders and or conditions include but are not limited to benign tumors for example hemangiomas acoustic neuromas neurofibromas trachomas and pyogenic granulomas artheroscleric plaques ocular angiogenic diseases for example diabetic retinopathy retinopathy of prematurity macular degeneration corneal graft rejection neovascular glaucoma retrolental fibroplasia rubeosis retinoblastoma uvietis and Pterygia abnormal blood vessel growth of the eye rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis delayed wound healing endometriosis vasculogenesis granulations hypertrophic scars keloids nonunion fractures scleroderma trachoma vascular adhesions myocardial angiogenesis coronary collaterals cerebral collaterals arteriovenous malformations ischemic limb angiogenesis Osler Webber Syndrome plaque neovascularization telangiectasia hemophiliac joints angiofibroma fibromuscular dysplasia wound granulation Crohn s disease and atherosclerosis.

For example within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating preventing and or diagnosing hypertrophic scars and keloids comprising the step of administering a polynucleotide polypeptide antagonist and or agonist of the invention to a hypertrophic scar or keloid.

Within one embodiment of the present invention polynucleotides polypeptides antagonists and or agonists are directly injected into a hypertrophic scar or keloid in order to prevent the progression of these lesions. This therapy is of particular value in the prophylactic treatment of conditions which are known to result in the development of hypertrophic scars and keloids e.g. burns and is preferably initiated after the proliferative phase has had time to progress approximately 14 days after the initial injury but before hypertrophic scar or keloid development. As noted above the present invention also provides methods for treating preventing and or diagnosing neovascular diseases of the eye including for example corneal neovascularization neovascular glaucoma proliferative diabetic retinopathy retrolental fibroplasia and macular degeneration.

Moreover Ocular diseases disorders and or conditions associated with neovascularization which can be treated prevented and or diagnosed with the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention including agonists and or antagonists include but are not limited to neovascular glaucoma diabetic retinopathy retinoblastoma retrolental fibroplasia uveitis retinopathy of prematurity macular degeneration corneal graft neovascularization as well as other eye inflammatory diseases ocular tumors and diseases associated with choroidal or iris neovascularization.

Thus within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating or preventing neovascular diseases of the eye such as corneal neovascularization including corneal graft neovascularization comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound as described above to the cornea such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. Briefly the cornea is a tissue which normally lacks blood vessels. In certain pathological conditions however capillaries may extend into the cornea from the pericorneal vascular plexus of the limbus. When the cornea becomes vascularized it also becomes clouded resulting in a decline in the patient s visual acuity. Visual loss may become complete if the cornea completely opacitates. A wide variety of diseases disorders and or conditions can result in corneal neovascularization including for example corneal infections e.g. trachoma herpes simplex keratitis leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis immunological processes e.g. graft rejection and Stevens Johnson s syndrome alkali burns trauma inflammation of any cause toxic and nutritional deficiency states and as a complication of wearing contact lenses.

Within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention may be prepared for topical administration in saline combined with any of the preservatives and antimicrobial agents commonly used in ocular preparations and administered in eyedrop form. The solution or suspension may be prepared in its pure form and administered several times daily. Alternatively anti angiogenic compositions prepared as described above may also be administered directly to the cornea. Within preferred embodiments the anti angiogenic composition is prepared with a muco adhesive polymer which binds to cornea. Within further embodiments the anti angiogenic factors or anti angiogenic compositions may be utilized as an adjunct to conventional steroid therapy. Topical therapy may also be useful prophylactically in corneal lesions which are known to have a high probability of inducing an angiogenic response such as chemical burns . In these instances the treatment likely in combination with steroids may be instituted immediately to help prevent subsequent complications.

Within other embodiments the compounds described above may be injected directly into the corneal stroma by an opthalmologist under microscopic guidance. The preferred site of injection may vary with the morphology of the individual lesion but the goal of the administration would be to place the composition at the advancing front of the vasculature i.e. interspersed between the blood vessels and the normal cornea . In most cases this would involve perilimbic corneal injection to protect the cornea from the advancing blood vessels. This method may also be utilized shortly after a corneal insult in order to prophylactically prevent corneal neovascularization. In this situation the material could be injected in the perilimbic cornea interspersed between the corneal lesion and its undesired potential limbic blood supply. Such methods may also be utilized in a similar fashion to prevent capillary invasion of transplanted corneas. In a sustained release form injections might only be required 2 3 times per year. A steroid could also be added to the injection solution to reduce inflammation resulting from the injection itself.

Within another aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating or preventing neovascular glaucoma comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a polynucleotide polypeptide antagonist and or agonist to the eye such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. In one embodiment the compound may be administered topically to the eye in order to treat or prevent early forms of neovascular glaucoma. Within other embodiments the compound may be implanted by injection into the region of the anterior chamber angle. Within other embodiments the compound may also be placed in any location such that the compound is continuously released into the aqueous humor. Within another aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating or preventing proliferative diabetic retinopathy comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a polynucleotide polypeptide antagonist and or agonist to the eyes such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited.

Within other aspects of the present invention compositions e.g. in the form of a spray may be delivered via endoscopic procedures in order to coat tumors or inhibit angiogenesis in a desired locale. Within yet other aspects of the present invention surgical meshes which have been coated with anti angiogenic compositions of the present invention may be utilized in any procedure wherein a surgical mesh might be utilized. For example within one embodiment of the invention a surgical mesh laden with an anti angiogenic composition may be utilized during abdominal cancer resection surgery e.g. subsequent to colon resection in order to provide support to the structure and to release an amount of the anti angiogenic factor.

Within further aspects of the present invention methods are provided for treating tumor excision sites comprising administering a polynucleotide polypeptide agonist and or agonist to the resection margins of a tumor subsequent to excision such that the local recurrence of cancer and the formation of new blood vessels at the site is inhibited.

A polypeptide of the present invention may be used to screen for molecules that bind to the polypeptide or for molecules to which the polypeptide binds. The binding of the polypeptide and the molecule may activate agonist increase inhibit antagonist or decrease activity of the polypeptide or the molecule bound. Examples of such molecules include antibodies oligonucleotides proteins e.g. receptors or small molecules.

Preferably the molecule is closely related to the natural ligand of the polypeptide e.g. a fragment of the ligand or a natural substrate a ligand a structural or functional mimetic. See Coligan et al. Current Protocols in Immunology 1 2 Chapter 5 1991 . Similarly the molecule can be closely related to the natural receptor to which the polypeptide binds or at least a fragment of the receptor capable of being bound by the polypeptide e.g. active site . In either case the molecule can be rationally designed using known techniques.

Preferably the screening for these molecules involves producing appropriate cells which express the polypeptide either as a secreted protein or on the cell membrane. Preferred cells include cells from mammals yeast or . Cells expressing the polypeptide or cell membrane containing the expressed polypeptide are then preferably contacted with a test compound potentially containing the molecule to observe binding stimulation or inhibition of activity of either the polypeptide or the molecule.

The assay may simply test binding of a candidate compound to the polypeptide wherein binding is detected by a label or in an assay involving competition with a labeled competitor. Further the assay may test whether the candidate compound results in a signal generated by binding to the polypeptide.

Preferably an ELISA assay can measure polypeptide level or activity in a sample e.g. biological sample using a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. The antibody can measure polypeptide level or activity by either binding directly or indirectly to the polypeptide or by competing with the polypeptide for a substrate.

Additionally the receptor to which a polypeptide of the invention binds can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art for example ligand panning and FACS sorting Coligan et al. Current Protocols in Immun. 1 2 Chapter 5 1991 . For example expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the polypeptides for example NIH3T3 cells which are known to contain multiple receptors for the FGF family proteins and SC 3 cells and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to the polypeptides. Transfected cells which are grown on glass slides are exposed to the polypeptide of the present invention after they have been labeled. The polypeptides can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion of a recognition site for a site specific protein kinase.

Following fixation and incubation the slides are subjected to auto radiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub pools are prepared and re transfected using an iterative sub pooling and re screening process eventually yielding a single clones that encodes the putative receptor.

As an alternative approach for receptor identification the labeled polypeptides can be photoaffinity linked with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross linked material is resolved by PAGE analysis and exposed to X ray film. The labeled complex containing the receptors of the polypeptides can be excised resolved into peptide fragments and subjected to protein microsequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from microsequencing would be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the genes encoding the putative receptors.

Moreover the techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling may be employed to modulate the activities of polypeptides of the invention thereby effectively generating agonists and antagonists of polypeptides of the invention.

A control assay may be performed in the absence of the compound to be screened and compared to the amount of fibroblast proliferation in the presence of the compound to determine if the compound stimulates proliferation by determining the uptake of 3 H thymidine in each case. The amount of fibroblast cell proliferation is measured by liquid scintillation chromatography which measures the incorporation of 3 H thymidine. Both agonist and antagonist compounds may be identified by this procedure.

In another method a mammalian cell or membrane preparation expressing a receptor for a polypeptide of the present invention is incubated with a labeled polypeptide of the present invention in the presence of the compound. The ability of the compound to enhance or block this interaction could then be measured.

Further contemplated is the use of the polypeptides of the present invention or the polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides to screen for molecules which modify the activities of the polypeptides of the present invention. Such a method would include contacting the polypeptide of the present invention with a selected compound s suspected of having antagonist or agonist activity and assaying the activity of these polypeptides following binding.

This invention is particularly useful for screening therapeutic compounds by using the polypeptides of the present invention or binding fragments thereof in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The polypeptide or fragment employed in such a test may be affixed to a solid support expressed on a cell surface free in solution or located intracellularly. One method of drug screening utilizes eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells which are stably transformed with recombinant nucleic acids expressing the polypeptide or fragment. Drugs are screened against such transformed cells in competitive binding assays. One may measure for example the formulation of complexes between the agent being tested and a polypeptide of the present invention.

Thus the present invention provides methods of screening for drugs or any other agents which affect activities mediated by the polypeptides of the present invention. These methods comprise contacting such an agent with a polypeptide of the present invention or a fragment thereof and assaying for the presence of a complex between the agent and the polypeptide or a fragment thereof by methods well known in the art. In such a competitive binding assay the agents to screen are typically labeled. Following incubation free agent is separated from that present in bound form and the amount of free or uncomplexed label is a measure of the ability of a particular agent to bind to the polypeptides of the present invention.

Another technique for drug screening provides high throughput screening for compounds having suitable binding affinity to the polypeptides of the present invention and is described in great detail in European Patent Application 84 03564 published on Sep. 13 1984 which is incorporated herein by reference herein. Briefly stated large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate such as plastic pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds are reacted with polypeptides of the present invention and washed. Bound polypeptides are then detected by methods well known in the art. Purified polypeptides are coated directly onto plates for use in the aforementioned drug screening techniques. In addition non neutralizing antibodies may be used to capture the peptide and immobilize it on the solid support.

This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralizing antibodies capable of binding polypeptides of the present invention specifically compete with a test compound for binding to the polypeptides or fragments thereof. In this manner the antibodies are used to detect the presence of any peptide which shares one or more antigenic epitopes with a polypeptide of the invention.

The human BGS 42 polypeptides and or peptides of the present invention or immunogenic fragments or oligopeptides thereof can be used for screening therapeutic drugs or compounds in a variety of drug screening techniques. The fragment employed in such a screening assay may be free in solution affixed to a solid support borne on a cell surface or located intracellularly. The reduction or abolition of activity of the formation of binding complexes between the ion channel protein and the agent being tested can be measured. Thus the present invention provides a method for screening or assessing a plurality of compounds for their specific binding affinity with a BGS 42 polypeptide or a bindable peptide fragment of this invention comprising providing a plurality of compounds combining the BGS 42 polypeptide or a bindable peptide fragment with each of a plurality of compounds for a time sufficient to allow binding under suitable conditions and detecting binding of the BGS 42 polypeptide or peptide to each of the plurality of test compounds thereby identifying the compounds that specifically bind to the BGS 42 polypeptide or peptide.

Methods of identifying compounds that modulate the activity of the novel human BGS 42 polypeptides and or peptides are provided by the present invention and comprise combining a potential or candidate compound or drug modulator of tubulin tyrosine ligase protein biological activity with an BGS 42 polypeptide or peptide for example the BGS 42 amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOS 2 and measuring an effect of the candidate compound or drug modulator on the biological activity of the BGS 42 polypeptide or peptide. Such measurable effects include for example physical binding interaction the ability to cleave a suitable tubulin tyrosine ligase protein substrate effects on native and cloned BGS 42 expressing cell line and effects of modulators or other tubulin tyrosine ligase protein mediated physiological measures.

Another method of identifying compounds that modulate the biological activity of the novel BGS 42 polypeptides of the present invention comprises combining a potential or candidate compound or drug modulator of a tubulin tyrosine ligase protein biological activity with a host cell that expresses the BGS 42 polypeptide and measuring an effect of the candidate compound or drug modulator on the biological activity of the BGS 42 polypeptide. The host cell can also be capable of being induced to express the BGS 42 polypeptide e.g. via inducible expression. Physiological effects of a given modulator candidate on the BGS 42 polypeptide can also be measured. Thus cellular assays for particular tubulin tyrosine ligase protein modulators may be either direct measurement or quantification of the physical biological activity of the BGS 42 polypeptide or they may be measurement or quantification of a physiological effect. Such methods preferably employ a BGS 42 polypeptide as described herein or an overexpressed recombinant BGS 42 polypeptide in suitable host cells containing an expression vector as described herein wherein the BGS 42 polypeptide is expressed overexpressed or undergoes upregulated expression.

Another aspect of the present invention embraces a method of screening for a compound that is capable of modulating the biological activity of a BGS 42 polypeptide comprising providing a host cell containing an expression vector harboring a nucleic acid sequence encoding a BGS 42 polypeptide or a functional peptide or portion thereof e.g. SEQ ID NOS 2 determining the biological activity of the expressed BGS 42 polypeptide in the absence of a modulator compound contacting the cell with the modulator compound and determining the biological activity of the expressed BGS 42 polypeptide in the presence of the modulator compound. In such a method a difference between the activity of the BGS 42 polypeptide in the presence of the modulator compound and in the absence of the modulator compound indicates a modulating effect of the compound.

Essentially any chemical compound can be employed as a potential modulator or ligand in the assays according to the present invention. Compounds tested as tubulin tyrosine ligase protein modulators can be any small chemical compound or biological entity e.g. protein sugar nucleic acid lipid . Test compounds will typically be small chemical molecules and peptides. Generally the compounds used as potential modulators can be dissolved in aqueous or organic e.g. DMSO based solutions. The assays are designed to screen large chemical libraries by automating the assay steps and providing compounds from any convenient source. Assays are typically run in parallel for example in microtiter formats on microtiter plates in robotic assays. There are many suppliers of chemical compounds including Sigma St. Louis Mo. Aldrich St. Louis Mo. Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. Fluka Chemika Biochemica Analytika Buchs Switzerland for example. Also compounds may be synthesized by methods known in the art.

High throughput screening methodologies are particularly envisioned for the detection of modulators of the novel BGS 42 polynucleotides and polypeptides described herein. Such high throughput screening methods typically involve providing a combinatorial chemical or peptide library containing a large number of potential therapeutic compounds e.g. ligand or modulator compounds . Such combinatorial chemical libraries or ligand libraries are then screened in one or more assays to identify those library members e.g. particular chemical species or subclasses that display a desired characteristic activity. The compounds so identified can serve as conventional lead compounds or can themselves be used as potential or actual therapeutics.

A combinatorial chemical library is a collection of diverse chemical compounds generated either by chemical synthesis or biological synthesis by combining a number of chemical building blocks i.e. reagents such as amino acids . As an example a linear combinatorial library e.g. a polypeptide or peptide library is formed by combining a set of chemical building blocks in every possible way for a given compound length i.e. the number of amino acids in a polypeptide or peptide compound . Millions of chemical compounds can be synthesized through such combinatorial mixing of chemical building blocks.

The preparation and screening of combinatorial chemical libraries is well known to those having skill in the pertinent art. Combinatorial libraries include without limitation peptide libraries e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 010 175 Furka 199137 487 493 and Houghton et al. 1991354 84 88 . Other chemistries for generating chemical diversity libraries can also be used.

Symphony Rainin Woburn Mass. 433A Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. 9050 Plus Millipore Bedford Mass. .

In one embodiment the invention provides solid phase based in vitro assays in a high throughput format where the cell or tissue expressing an ion channel is attached to a solid phase substrate. In such high throughput assays it is possible to screen up to several thousand different modulators or ligands in a single day. In particular each well of a microtiter plate can be used to perform a separate assay against a selected potential modulator or if concentration or incubation time effects are to be observed every 5 10 wells can test a single modulator. Thus a single standard microtiter plate can assay about 96 modulators. If 1536 well plates are used then a single plate can easily assay from about 100 to about 1500 different compounds. It is possible to assay several different plates per day thus for example assay screens for up to about 6 000 20 000 different compounds are possible using the described integrated systems.

In another of its aspects the present invention encompasses screening and small molecule e.g. drug detection assays which involve the detection or identification of small molecules that can bind to a given protein i.e. a BGS 42 polypeptide or peptide. Particularly preferred are assays suitable for high throughput screening methodologies.

In such binding based detection identification or screening assays a functional assay is not typically required. All that is needed is a target protein preferably substantially purified and a library or panel of compounds e.g. ligands drugs small molecules or biological entities to be screened or assayed for binding to the protein target. Preferably most small molecules that bind to the target protein will modulate activity in some manner due to preferential higher affinity binding to functional areas or sites on the protein.

An example of such an assay is the fluorescence based thermal shift assay 3 Dimensional Pharmaceuticals Inc. 3DP Exton Pa. as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 020 141 and 6 036 920 to Pantoliano et al. see also J. Zimmerman 200020 8 . The assay allows the detection of small molecules e.g. drugs ligands that bind to expressed and preferably purified ion channel polypeptide based on affinity of binding determinations by analyzing thermal unfolding curves of protein drug or ligand complexes. The drugs or binding molecules determined by this technique can be further assayed if desired by methods such as those described herein to determine if the molecules affect or modulate function or activity of the target protein.

To purify a BGS 42 polypeptide or peptide to measure a biological binding or ligand binding activity the source may be a whole cell lysate that can be prepared by successive freeze thaw cycles e.g. one to three in the presence of standard protease inhibitors. The BGS 42 polypeptide may be partially or completely purified by standard protein purification methods e.g. affinity chromatography using specific antibody described infra or by ligands specific for an epitope tag engineered into the recombinant BGS 42 polypeptide molecule also as described herein. Binding activity can then be measured as described.

Compounds which are identified according to the methods provided herein and which modulate or regulate the biological activity or physiology of the BGS 42 polypeptides according to the present invention are a preferred embodiment of this invention. It is contemplated that such modulatory compounds may be employed in treatment and therapeutic methods for treating a condition that is mediated by the novel BGS 42 polypeptides by administering to an individual in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of the compound identified by the methods described herein.

In addition the present invention provides methods for treating an individual in need of such treatment for a disease disorder or condition that is mediated by the BGS 42 polypeptides of the invention comprising administering to the individual a therapeutically effective amount of the BGS 42 modulating compound identified by a method provided herein.

In specific embodiments antagonists according to the present invention are nucleic acids corresponding to the sequences contained in SEQ ID NO 1 or the complementary strand thereof and or to nucleotide sequences contained a deposited clone. In one embodiment antisense sequence is generated internally by the organism in another embodiment the antisense sequence is separately administered see for example O Connor Neurochem. 56 560 1991 . Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA or through triple helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example in Okano Neurochem. 56 560 1991 Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Triple helix formation is discussed in for instance Lee et al. Nucleic Acids Research 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. Science 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. Science 251 1300 1991 . The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA.

For example the use of c myc and c myb antisense RNA constructs to inhibit the growth of the non lymphocytic leukemia cell line HL 60 and other cell lines was previously described. Wickstrom et al. 1988 Anfossi et al. 1989 . These experiments were performed in vitro by incubating cells with the oligoribonucleotide. A similar procedure for in vivo use is described in WO 91 15580. Briefly a pair of oligonucleotides for a given antisense RNA is produced as follows A sequence complimentary to the first 15 bases of the open reading frame is flanked by an EcoR1 site on the 5 end and a HindIII site on the 3 end. Next the pair of oligonucleotides is heated at 90 C. for one minute and then annealed in 2 ligation buffer 20 mM TRIS HCl pH 7.5 10 mM MgCl2 10 mM dithiothreitol DTT and 0.2 mM ATP and then ligated to the EcoR1 Hind III site of the retroviral vector PMV7 WO 91 15580 .

For example the 5 coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the mature polypeptide of the present invention may be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of the receptor. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into receptor polypeptide. Antisense oligonucleotides may be single or double stranded. Double stranded RNA s may be designed based upon the teachings of Paddison et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 99 1443 1448 2002 and International Publication Nos. WO 01 29058 and WO 99 32619 which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment the antisense nucleic acid of the invention is produced intracellularly by transcription from an exogenous sequence. For example a vector or a portion thereof is transcribed producing an antisense nucleic acid RNA of the invention. Such a vector would contain a sequence encoding the antisense nucleic acid of the invention. Such a vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Such vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology methods standard in the art. Vectors can be plasmid viral or others known in the art used for replication and expression in vertebrate cells. Expression of the sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention or fragments thereof can be by any promoter known in the art to act in vertebrate preferably human cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive. Such promoters include but are not limited to the SV40 early promoter region Bernoist and Chambon Nature 29 304 310 1981 the promoter contained in the 3 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus Yamamoto et al. Cell 22 787 797 1980 the herpes thymidine promoter Wagner et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78 1441 1445 1981 the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene Brinster et al. Nature 296 39 42 1982 etc.

The antisense nucleic acids of the invention comprise a sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of a gene of interest. However absolute complementarity although preferred is not required. A sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA referred to herein means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA forming a stable duplex in the case of double stranded antisense nucleic acids of the invention a single strand of the duplex DNA may thus be tested or triplex formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid Generally the larger the hybridizing nucleic acid the more base mismatches with a RNA sequence of the invention it may contain and still form a stable duplex or triplex as the case may be . One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.

Oligonucleotides that are complementary to the 5 end of the message e.g. the 5 untranslated sequence up to and including the AUG initiation codon should work most efficiently at inhibiting translation. However sequences complementary to the 3 untranslated sequences of mRNAs have been shown to be effective at inhibiting translation of mRNAs as well. See generally Wagner R. Nature 372 333 335 1994 . Thus oligonucleotides complementary to either the 5 or 3 non translated non coding regions of a polynucleotide sequence of the invention could be used in an antisense approach to inhibit translation of endogenous mRNA. Oligonucleotides complementary to the 5 untranslated region of the mRNA should include the complement of the AUG start codon. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to mRNA coding regions are less efficient inhibitors of translation but could be used in accordance with the invention. Whether designed to hybridize to the 5 3 or coding region of mRNA antisense nucleic acids should be at least six nucleotides in length and are preferably oligonucleotides ranging from 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length. In specific aspects the oligonucleotide is at least 10 nucleotides at least 17 nucleotides at least 25 nucleotides or at least 50 nucleotides.

The polynucleotides of the invention can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof single stranded or double stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety sugar moiety or phosphate backbone for example to improve stability of the molecule hybridization etc. The oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides e.g. for targeting host cell receptors in vivo or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane see e.g. Letsinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86 6553 6556 1989 Lemaitre et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84 648 652 1987 PCT Publication NO WO88 09810 published Dec. 15 1988 or the blood brain barrier see e.g. PCT Publication NO WO89 10134 published Apr. 25 1988 hybridization triggered cleavage agents. See e.g. Krol et al. BioTechniques 6 958 976 1988 or intercalating agents. See e.g. Zon Pharm. Res. 5 539 549 1988 . To this end the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule e.g. a peptide hybridization triggered cross linking agent transport agent hybridization triggered cleavage agent etc.

The antisense oligonucleotide may comprise at least one modified base moiety which is selected from the group including but not limited to 5 fluorouracil 5 bromouracil 5 chlorouracil 5 iodouracil hypoxanthine xanthine 4 acetylcytosine 5 carboxyhydroxylmethyl uracil 5 carboxymethylaminomethyl 2 thiouridine 5 carboxymethylaminomethyluracil dihydrouracil beta D galactosylqueosine inosine N6 isopentenyladenine 1 methylguanine 1 methylinosine 2 2 dimethylguanine 2 methyladenine 2 methylguanine 3 methylcytosine 5 methylcytosine N6 adenine 7 methylguanine 5 methylaminomethyluracil 5 methoxyaminomethyl 2 thiouracil beta D mannosylqueosine 5 methoxycarboxymethyluracil 5 methoxyuracil 2 methylthio N6 isopentenyladenine uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v wybutoxosine pseudouracil queosine 2 thiocytosine 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 2 thiouracil 4 thiouracil 5 methyluracil uracil 5 oxyacetic acid methylester uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 3 3 amino 3 N 2 carboxypropyl uracil acp3 w and 2 6 diaminopurine.

The antisense oligonucleotide may also comprise at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including but not limited to arabinose 2 fluoroarabinose xylulose and hexose.

In yet another embodiment the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified phosphate backbone selected from the group including but not limited to a phosphorothioate a phosphorodithioate a phosphoramidothioate a phosphoramidate a phosphordiamidate a methylphosphonate an alkyl phosphotriester and a formacetal or analog thereof.

In yet another embodiment the antisense oligonucleotide is an a anomeric oligonucleotide. An a anomeric oligonucleotide forms specific double stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which contrary to the usual b units the strands run parallel to each other Gautier et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 15 6625 6641 1987 . The oligonucleotide is a 2 0 methylribonucleotide Inoue et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 15 6131 6148 1987 or a chimeric RNA DNA analogue Inoue et al. FEBS Lett. 215 327 330 1987 .

Polynucleotides of the invention may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art e.g. by use of an automated DNA synthesizer such as are commercially available from Biosearch Applied Biosystems etc. . As examples phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 16 3209 1988 methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore glass polymer supports Sarin et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85 7448 7451 1988 etc.

While antisense nucleotides complementary to the coding region sequence of the invention could be used those complementary to the transcribed untranslated region are most preferred.

Potential antagonists according to the invention also include catalytic RNA or a ribozyme See e.g. PCT International Publication WO 90 11364 published Oct. 4 1990 Sarver et al Science 247 1222 1225 1990 . While ribozymes that cleave mRNA at site specific recognition sequences can be used to destroy mRNAs corresponding to the polynucleotides of the invention the use of hammerhead ribozymes is preferred. Hammerhead ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the target mRNA. The sole requirement is that the target mRNA have the following sequence of two bases 5 UG 3 . The construction and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff and Gerlach Nature 334 585 591 1988 . There are numerous potential hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites within each nucleotide sequence disclosed in the sequence listing. Preferably the ribozyme is engineered so that the cleavage recognition site is located near the 5 end of the mRNA corresponding to the polynucleotides of the invention i.e. to increase efficiency and minimize the intracellular accumulation of non functional mRNA transcripts.

As in the antisense approach the ribozymes of the invention can be composed of modified oligonucleotides e.g. for improved stability targeting etc. and should be delivered to cells which express the polynucleotides of the invention in vivo. DNA constructs encoding the ribozyme may be introduced into the cell in the same manner as described above for the introduction of antisense encoding DNA. A preferred method of delivery involves using a DNA construct encoding the ribozyme under the control of a strong constitutive promoter such as for example pol III or pol II promoter so that transfected cells will produce sufficient quantities of the ribozyme to destroy endogenous messages and inhibit translation. Since ribozymes unlike antisense molecules are catalytic a lower intracellular concentration is required for efficiency.

Antagonist agonist compounds may be employed to inhibit the cell growth and proliferation effects of the polypeptides of the present invention on neoplastic cells and tissues i.e. stimulation of angiogenesis of tumors and therefore retard or prevent abnormal cellular growth and proliferation for example in tumor formation or growth.

The antagonist agonist may also be employed to prevent hyper vascular diseases and prevent the proliferation of epithelial lens cells after extracapsular cataract surgery. Prevention of the mitogenic activity of the polypeptides of the present invention may also be desirous in cases such as restenosis after balloon angioplasty.

The antagonist agonist may also be employed to prevent the growth of scar tissue during wound healing.

The antagonist agonist may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose the diseases described herein.

Thus the invention provides a method of treating or preventing diseases disorders and or conditions including but not limited to the diseases disorders and or conditions listed throughout this application associated with overexpression of a polynucleotide of the present invention by administering to a patient a an antisense molecule directed to the polynucleotide of the present invention and or b a ribozyme directed to the polynucleotide of the present invention.

A polynucleotide or polypeptide and or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the organisms ability either directly or indirectly to initiate and or maintain biotic associations with other organisms. Such associations may be symbiotic nonsymbiotic endosymbiotic macrosymbiotic and or microsymbiotic in nature. In general a polynucleotide or polypeptide and or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the organisms ability to form biotic associations with any member of the fungal bacterial lichen mycorrhizal cyanobacterial dinoflaggellate and or algal kingdom phylums families classes genuses and or species.

The mechanism by which a polynucleotide or polypeptide and or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the host organisms ability either directly or indirectly to initiate and or maintain biotic associations is variable though may include modulating osmolarity to desirable levels for the symbiont modulating pH to desirable levels for the symbiont modulating secretions of organic acids modulating the secretion of specific proteins phenolic compounds nutrients or the increased expression of a protein required for host biotic organisms interactions e.g. a receptor ligand etc. . Additional mechanisms are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention see for example Microbial Signalling and Communication eds. R. England G. Hobbs N. Bainton and D. McL. Roberts Cambridge University Press Cambridge 1999 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference .

In an alternative embodiment a polynucleotide or polypeptide and or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may decrease the host organisms ability to form biotic associations with another organism either directly or indirectly. The mechanism by which a polynucleotide or polypeptide and or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may decrease the host organisms ability either directly or indirectly to initiate and or maintain biotic associations with another organism is variable though may include modulating osmolarity to undesirable levels modulating pH to undesirable levels modulating secretions of organic acids modulating the secretion of specific proteins phenolic compounds nutrients or the decreased expression of a protein required for host biotic organisms interactions e.g. a receptor ligand etc. . Additional mechanisms are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention see for example Microbial Signalling and Communication eds. R. England G. Hobbs N. Bainton and D. McL. Roberts Cambridge University Press Cambridge 1999 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference .

The hosts ability to maintain biotic associations with a particular pathogen has significant implications for the overall health and fitness of the host. For example human hosts have symbiosis with enteric bacteria in their gastrointestinal tracts particularly in the small and large intestine. In fact bacteria counts in feces of the distal colon often approach 10per milliliter of feces. Examples of bowel flora in the gastrointestinal tract are members of the Enterobacteriaceae in addition to a hemolytic streptococci Bifobacteria Anaerobic cocci Eubacteria Costridia lactobacilli and yeasts. Such bacteria among other things assist the host in the assimilation of nutrients by breaking down food stuffs not typically broken down by the hosts digestive system particularly in the hosts bowel. Therefore increasing the hosts ability to maintain such a biotic association would help assure proper nutrition for the host.

Aberrations in the enteric bacterial population of mammals particularly humans has been associated with the following disorders diarrhea ileus chronic inflammatory disease bowel obstruction duodenal diverticula biliary calculous disease and malnutrition. A polynucleotide or polypeptide and or agonist or antagonist of the present invention are useful for treating detecting diagnosing prognosing and or ameliorating either directly or indirectly and of the above mentioned diseases and or disorders associated with aberrant enteric flora population.

The composition of the intestinal flora for example is based upon a variety of factors which include but are not limited to the age race diet malnutrition gastric acidity bile salt excretion gut motility and immune mechanisms. As a result the polynucleotides and polypeptides including agonists antagonists and fragments thereof may modulate the ability of a host to form biotic associations by affecting directly or indirectly at least one or more of these factors.

Although the predominate intestinal flora comprises anaerobic organisms an underlying percentage represents aerobes e.g. . This is significant as such aerobes rapidly become the predominate organisms in intraabdominal infections effectively becoming opportunistic early in infection pathogenesis. As a result there is an intrinsic need to control aerobe populations particularly for immune compromised individuals.

In a preferred embodiment a polynucleotides and polypeptides including agonists antagonists and fragments thereof are useful for inhibiting biotic associations with specific enteric symbiont organisms in an effort to control the population of such organisms.

Biotic associations occur not only in the gastrointestinal tract but also on an in the integument. As opposed to the gastrointestinal flora the cutaneous flora is comprised almost equally with aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Examples of cutaneous flora are members of the gram positive cocci e.g. coagulase negative staphylococci micrococcus gram positive bacilli e.g. species species species gram negative bacilli e.g. species and fungi . The relatively low number of flora associated with the integument is based upon the inability of many organisms to adhere to the skin. The organisms referenced above have acquired this unique ability. Therefore the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention may have uses which include modulating the population of the cutaneous flora either directly or indirectly.

Aberrations in the cutaneous flora are associated with a number of significant diseases and or disorders which include but are not limited to the following impetigo ecthyma blistering distal dactulitis pustules folliculitis cutaneous abscesses pitted keratolysis trichomycosis axcillaris dermatophytosis complex axillary odor erthyrasma cheesy foot odor acne tinea versicolor seborrheic dermititis and to name a few. A polynucleotide or polypeptide and or agonist or antagonist of the present invention are useful for treating detecting diagnosing prognosing and or ameliorating either directly or indirectly and of the above mentioned diseases and or disorders associated with aberrant cutaneous flora population.

Additional biotic associations including diseases and disorders associated with the aberrant growth of such associations are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention. See for example Infectious Disease Second Edition Eds. S. L. Gorbach J. G. Bartlett and N. R. Blacklow W. B. Saunders Company Philadelphia 1998 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference .

In another embodiment a polynucleotide or polypeptide and or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the organisms ability to synthesize and or release a pheromone. Such a pheromone may for example alter the organisms behavior and or metabolism.

A polynucleotide or polypeptide and or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may modulate the biosynthesis and or release of pheromones the organisms ability to respond to pheromones e.g. behaviorally and or metabolically and or the organisms ability to detect pheromones. Preferably any of the pheromones and or volatiles released from the organism or induced by a polynucleotide or polypeptide and or agonist or antagonist of the invention have behavioral effects the organism.

The polypeptide of the present invention as a result of the ability to stimulate vascular endothelial cell growth may be employed in treatment for stimulating re vascularization of ischemic tissues due to various disease conditions such as thrombosis arteriosclerosis and other cardiovascular conditions. These polypeptide may also be employed to stimulate angiogenesis and limb regeneration as discussed above.

The polypeptide may also be employed for treating wounds due to injuries burns post operative tissue repair and ulcers since they are mitogenic to various cells of different origins such as fibroblast cells and skeletal muscle cells and therefore facilitate the repair or replacement of damaged or diseased tissue.

The polypeptide of the present invention may also be employed stimulate neuronal growth and to treat prevent and or diagnose neuronal damage which occurs in certain neuronal disorders or neuro degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease and AIDS related complex. The polypeptide of the invention may have the ability to stimulate chondrocyte growth therefore they may be employed to enhance bone and periodontal regeneration and aid in tissue transplants or bone grafts.

Such a use may be administered in simultaneous conjunction with said pharmaceutical or separately through either the same or different route of administration e.g. intravenous for the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention and orally for the pharmaceutical among others described herein. .

Polypeptide or polynucleotides and or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to prepare individuals for extraterrestrial travel low gravity environments prolonged exposure to extraterrestrial radiation levels low oxygen levels reduction of metabolic activity exposure to extraterrestrial pathogens etc. Such a use may be administered either prior to an extraterrestrial event during an extraterrestrial event or both. Moreover such a use may result in a number of beneficial changes in the recipient such as for example any one of the following non limiting effects an increased level of hematopoietic cells particularly red blood cells which would aid the recipient in coping with low oxygen levels an increased level of B cells T cells antigen presenting cells and or macrophages which would aid the recipient in coping with exposure to extraterrestrial pathogens for example a temporary i.e. reversible inhibition of hematopoietic cell production which would aid the recipient in coping with exposure to extraterrestrial radiation levels increase and or stability of bone mass which would aid the recipient in coping with low gravity environments and or decreased metabolism which would effectively facilitate the recipients ability to prolong their extraterrestrial travel by any one of the following non limiting means i aid the recipient by decreasing their basal daily energy requirements ii effectively lower the level of oxidative and or metabolic stress in recipient i.e. to enable recipient to cope with increased extraterrestial radiation levels by decreasing the level of internal oxidative metabolic damage acquired during normal basal energy requirements and or iii enabling recipient to subsist at a lower metabolic temperature i.e. cryogenic and or sub cryogenic environment .

Also preferred is a method of treatment of an individual in need of an increased level of a protein activity which method comprises administering to such an individual a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of an isolated polypeptide polynucleotide or antibody of the claimed invention effective to increase the level of said protein activity in said individual.

Having generally described the invention the same will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended as limiting.

Tubulin tyrosine ligase domain sequences from several different species were used as probes to search the human genomic sequence database. The search program used was gapped BLAST Altschul S F et al. Nucleic Acids Res 25 3389 3402 1997. . The top genomic exon hits from the BLAST results were searched back against the non redundant protein and patent sequence databases. From this analysis exons encoding potential novel tubulin tyrosine ligases were identified based on sequence homology and their most similar protein sequence were then used as a template to predict more exons using the GENEWISEDB program Birney and Durbin 2000 . The final predicted exons were assembled and full length clones of genes were obtained using the predicted exon sequences. With these analyses a predicted full length sequence of a novel human secreted protein named BGS 42 was identified directly from a piece of human genomic sequence GENBANK accession number AL022327 . The complete polynucleotide SEQ ID NO 1 and polypeptide SEQ ID NO 2 sequences of BGS 42 are shown . Mapping BGS 42 cDNA to human genome found that BGS 42 is located at chromosome 22q13.33 and there are three predicted CpG islands 2.0 kb upsteam of its first methionine indicating BGS 42 has a typical transcription signature.

BGS 42 was then analyzed for protein domains in Pfam database Bateman et. al. 2000 . The Pfam is a database of multiple alignments of protein domains or conserved protein regions. The alignments provide insight into protein families evolutionary conserved structure which often has implications for the protein s function. Such Pfams can be very useful for automatically recognizing that a new protein belongs to an existing protein family even if the homology is weak A. Bateman E. Birney R. Durbin S. R. Eddy K. L. Howe and E. L. L. Sonnhammer. 28 263 266 2000 .

Based upon the Pfam analysis the BGS 42 polypeptide was found to have significant sequence homology with TTL domains amino acids 73 to 365 of SEQ ID NO 2 as shown in . Based on sequence structure and known TTL signature sequences this novel protein BGS 42 is a novel human tubulin tyrosine ligase protein.

Poly A RNA from Clontech is treated with DNase I to remove genomic DNA contamination. The RNA is converted into double stranded cDNA using the SUPERSCRIPT Plasmid System for cDNA Synthesis and Plasmid Cloning Life Technologies . The cDNA is size fractionated on a TRANSGENOMICS HPLC size exclusion column TosoHass with dimensions of 7.8 mm 30 cm and a particle size of 10 m. Tris buffered saline is used as the mobile phase and the column is run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min. The system is calibrated using a 1 kb ladder to determine which fractions are to be pooled to obtain the largest cDNA library. Generally fractions that eluted in the range of 12 to 15 minutes are used. The cDNA is precipitated concentrated and then ligated into the Sal I Not I sites in pSPORT. Following electroporation of the cDNA into DH12S DNA from the resulting colonies is prepared and subjected to Sal I Not I restriction enzyme digestion. Generally the average insert size of libraries made by this procedure is greater than 3.5 Kb and the overall complexity of the library is greater than 10independent clones. The library is amplified in semi solid agar for 2 days at 30 C. An aliquot 200 microliters of the amplified library is inoculated into a 200 ml culture for single stranded DNA isolation by super infection with a fi helper phage. The single stranded circular DNA is concentrated by ethanol precipitation resuspended at a concentration of one microgram per microliter and used for the cDNA capture experiments.

LB medium 200 mL 400 ul carb is inoculated with 0.2 to 1 ml of thawed cDNA library. The culture is incubated shaking at 250 rpm at 37 C. for 45 min. The optical density of the culture is measured. The OD600 is preferably between 0.025 and 0.040. One mL M13K07 helper phage is added to the culture and grown for 2 hours. At that time 500 uL Kanamycin 30 mg mL is added and incubation continued for 15 18 hours.

Cultures are poured into six 50 mL tubes. Cells are centrifuged at 10000 rpm in an HB 6 rotor for 15 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant is retrieved and cells discarded. The supernatant is filtered through a 0.2 um filter. DNase I 12000 units from Gibco is added and incubated at room temperature for 90 minutes.

Fifty mL of ice cold 40 PEG 8000 2.5 M NaCl 10 mM MgSOis added to the cell pellets. The solution is mixed and distributed into 6 centrifuge tubes and covered with parafilm. The tubes are incubated on wet ice for 1 hour or at 4 C. overnight .

Phage are pelleted at 10000 rpm in an HB 6 rotor for 20 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant is discarded and the sides of the tubes wiped dry. The pellets are resuspended in 1 mL TE pH 8.

The resuspended pellets are placed in a 14 mL SARSTEDT tube 6 mL total . SDS is added to 0.1 60 uL of stock 10 SDS . Proteinase K 60 uL of 20 mg mL is then added and incubated at 42 C for 1 hour.

DNA is extracted with phenol chloroform by first adding 1 mL of 5M NaCl followed by an equal volume of phenol chloroform 6 mL . The mixture is vortexed and centrifuged at 5K in an HB 6 rotor for 5 minutes at 4 C. The aqueous top phase is transferred to a new SARSTEDT tube. Extractions are repeated until no interface is visible.

The DNA is precipitated in ethanol by adding 2 volumes of 100 ethanol and precipitating overnight at 20 C. The DNA is centrifuged at 10000 rpm in HB 6 rotor for 20 minutes at 4 C. The ethanol is discarded and the pellets resuspended in 700 uL 70 ethanol. The resuspended pellets are centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C. The ethanol is discarded and the pellets dried by vacuum.

Oligosaccharides are then removed by resuspending the pellet in 50 uL TE pH 8. The solutions are frozen on dry ice for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant is transferred to a new tube and the volume recorded.

The concentration of DNA is determined by measuring absorbance at 260 280. DNA is diluted 1 100 in a quartz cuvette 3 uL DNA 297 uL TE . The following equation is used to calculate DNA concentration 32 ug mL OD mL 100 uL 100 OD260 DNA concentration

Ethanol precipitation of the ssDNA is performed by adding 15 ug glycogen 16 uL 7.5 M NHOAc 125 uL 100 ethanol. The sample is centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 C. and the pellet washed with 125 uL 70 ethanol. The ethanol is discarded and pellet dried by vacuum. The pellet is resuspended in 10 uL TB pH 8.

3. 1 uL 0.01 ug uL pUC19 positive control DNA 1 10 5 ug is aliquoted to Eppendorf tubes. Cells are thawed on ice water. Forty uL of cells are added to each DNA aliquot by pipetting into a chilled cuvette placed between metal plates. Electroporation is carried out at 1.8 kV. Immediately following electroporation 1 mL SOC SOB glucose Mg media is added to the cuvette then transferred to a 15 mL tube. Cells are allowed to recover for 1 hr at 37 C. with shaking 225 rpm . Cells are then plated according to the following dilution scheme 

One microliter of anti sense biotinylated oligos or sense oligos when annealing to single stranded DNA from pSPORT2 vector containing one hundred and fifty nanograms of 1 to 50 different 80mer oligo probes is added to six microliters six micrograms of a mixture of up to 15 single stranded covalently closed circular cDNA libraries and seven microliters of 100 formamide in a 0.5 ml PCR tube. The sequence of the 80mer oligos used is as follows 

The mixture is heated in a thermal cycler to 95 C. for 2 min. Fourteen microliters of 2 hybridization buffer 50 formamide 1.5 M NaCl 0.04 M NaPO pH 7.2 5 min EDTA 0.2 SDS is added to the heated probe cDNA library mixture and incubated at 42 C. for 26 hours. Hybrids between the biotinylated oligo and the circular cDNA are isolated by diluting the hybridization mixture to 220 microliters solution containing 1 M NaCl 10 mm Tris HCl pH 7.5 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and adding 125 microliters of streptavidin magnetic beads. This solution is incubated at 42 C. for 60 min and mixed every 5 min to re suspend the beads. The beads are separated from the solution with a magnet and washed three times in 200 microliters of 0.1 SSPE 0.1 SDS at 45 C.

The single stranded cDNA is released from the biotinylated oligo streptavidin magnetic bead complex by adding 50 microliters of 0.1 N NaOH and incubating at room temperature for 10 min. Six microliters of 3 M sodium acetate is added along with 15 micrograms of glycogen and the solution ethanol precipitated with 120 microliters of 100 ethanol. The precipitated DNA is resuspended in 12 microliters of TB 10 min Tris HCl pH 8.0 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 . The single stranded cDNA is converted into double stranded DNA in a thermal cycler by mixing 5 microliters of the captured DNA with 1.5 microliters of 10 micromolar standard SP6 primer for libraries in pSPORT 1 and 2 and 17 primer for libraries in pCMVSPORT and 1.5 microliters of 10 PCR buffer.

Sequences of primers used to repair single stranded circular DNA isolated from the primary selection are as follows 

The mixture is heated to 95 C. for 20 seconds and the temperature gradually brought down to 59 C. Fifteen microliters of a repair mix that was preheated to 70 C. is added to the DNA repair mix contains 4 microliters of 5 mM dNTPs 1.25 mM each 1.5 microliters of 10 PCR buffer 9.25 microliters of water and 0.25 microliters of Taq polymerase . The solution incubation temperature is raised back to 73 C. and incubated for 23 mm. The repaired DNA is ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 10 microliters of TB. Electroporation is carried out using two microliters DNA per 40 microliters of DH12S cells. Three hundred and thirty three microliters are plated onto one 150 mm plate of LB agar plus 100 micrograms milliliter of ampicillin. After overnight incubation at 37 C. the colonies from all plates are harvested by scraping into 10 ml of LB medium 50 micrograms milliliter of ampicillin and 2 ml of sterile glycerol.

The second round of selection is initiated by making single stranded circular DNA from the primary selected library using the method listed above. The purified single stranded circular DNA is then assayed with gene specific primers for each of the targeted sequences using standard PCR conditions.

The sequences of the Gene Specific Primer GSP pairs used to identify the various targeted cDNAs in the primary selected single stranded cDNA libraries are as follows 

The secondary hybridization is carried out using only those 80mer biotinylated probes whose targeted sequences were positive with the GSPs. The resulting single stranded circular DNA is converted to double strands using the antisense oligo for each target sequence as the repair primer the sense primer is used for material captured from pSPORT2 libraries. The resulting double stranded DNA is electroporated into DH10B and the resulting colonies inoculated into 96 deep well blocks. Following overnight growth DNA is prepared and sequentially screened for each of the targeted sequences using the GSPs. The DNA is also cut with Sal I and Not I and the inserts sized by agarose gel electrophoresis.

Those cDNA clones that were positive by PCR had the inserts sized and three clones Clone A B and C SEQ ID NO 9 10 and 11 respectively were chosen for DNA sequencing. Clones A B and C were used to form a contig and thus derive the full length consensus sequence provided in SEQ ID NO 12 .

The consensus sequence SEQ ID NO 12 was then used to design RT PCR primers to verify the chimeric assembly. The sequences of the primers are 

The following PCR primer pair was used to measure the steady state levels of BGS 42 mRNA by quantitative PCR 

Briefly first strand cDNA was made from commercially available mRNA. The relative amount of cDNA used in each assay was determined by performing a parallel experiment using a primer pair for a gene expressed in equal amounts in all tissues cyclophilin. The cyclophilin primer pair detected small variations in the amount of cDNA in each sample and these data were used for normalization of the data obtained with the primer pair for this gene. The PCR data was converted into a relative assessment of the difference in transcript abundance amongst the tissues tested and the data is presented in . Transcripts corresponding to the novel tubulin tyrosine ligase protein BGS 42 were expressed predominately in testis. The BGS 42 polypeptide was also expressed significantly in small intestine stomach spinal cord and to a lesser extent in brain and liver.

Additional expression profiling was performed to compare the expression pattern of BGS 42 amongst various normal and tumor mRNA tissue sources as shown in . As shown transcripts corresponding to BGS 42 showed differential expression predominately in lung compared to tumor lung tissue with a 25 fold decrease in expression observed in lung tumors relative to normal lung tissue. The levels of the control transcript cyclophilin used in normalization were approximately equal in all samples indicating that the RNA was of good quality. This apparent loss of BGS 42 expression in tumor tissues relative to normal tissues suggests BGS 42 may play a role in tumor suppression either directly or indirectly. These data also show skeletal muscle as a tissue with relative high abundance.

Total RNA from tissues was isolated using the TRIZOL protocol Invitrogen and quantified by determining its absorbance at 260 nM. An assessment of the 18s and 28s ribosomal RNA bands was made by denaturing gel electrophoresis to determine RNA integrity.

The specific sequence to be measured was aligned with related genes found in GENBANK to identity regions of significant sequence divergence to maximize primer and probe specificity. Gene specific primers and probes were designed using the ABI primer express software to amplify small amplicons 150 base pairs or less to maximize the likelihood that the primers function at 100 efficiency. All primer probe sequences were searched against Public Genbank databases to ensure target specificity. Primers and probes were obtained from ABI.

To access the level of contaminating genomic DNA in the RNA the RNA was divided into 2 aliquots and one half was treated with Rnase free Dnase Invitrogen . Samples from both the Dnase treated and non treated were then subjected to reverse transcription reactions with RT and without RT the presence of reverse transcriptase. TAQMAN assays were carried out with gene specific primers see above and the contribution of genomic DNA to the signal detected was evaluated by comparing the threshold cycles obtained with the RT RT non Dnase treated RNA to that on the RT RT Dnase treated RNA. The amount of signal contributed by genomic DNA in the Dnased RT RNA must be less that 10 of that obtained with Dnased RT RNA. If not the RNA was not used in actual experiments.

100 ng of Dnase treated total RNA was annealed to 2.5 M of the respective gene specific reverse primer in the presence of 5.5 mM Magnesium Chloride by heating the sample to 72 C. for 2 min and then cooling to 55 C. for 30 min. 1.25 U l of MuLv reverse transcriptase and 500 M of each dNTP was added to the reaction and the tube was incubated at 37 C. for 30 min. The sample was then heated to 90 C. for 5 min to denature enzyme.

Quantitative sequence detection was carried out on an ABI PRISM 7700 by adding to the reverse transcribed reaction 2.5 M forward and reverse primers 500M of each dNTP buffer and 5 U AMPLITAQ GOLD . The PCR reaction was then held at 94 C. for 12 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 C. for 15 sec and 60 C. for 30 sec.

The threshold cycle Ct of the lowest expressing tissue the highest Ct value was used as the baseline of expression and all other tissues were expressed as the relative abundance to that tissue by calculating the difference in Ct value between the baseline and the other tissues and using it as the exponent in 2

The expanded expression profile of the BGS 42 polypeptide is provided in . The BGS 42 polypeptide was expressed predominately in the vas deferens. Expression of BGS 42 was also significantly expressed in lymph gland pituitary placenta and to a lesser extent in other tissues as shown.

Additional expression profiling was performed to compare the BGS 42 expression in normal versus tumor tissues. The expression of the BGS 42 polypeptide was not observed in any of the five testis tumor samples. This apparent loss of BGS 42 expression in tumor tissues relative to normal tissues suggests BGS 42 may play a role in tumor suppression either directly or indirectly.

The method of Raybin and Flavin may be followed essentially as described in Biochemistry 16 2189 2194. Briefly purified BGS42 protein may be tested for tubulin tyrosine ligase activity by incubating with appropriate levels of tubulin and tyrosine and C tyrosine in the presence of ATP. The reaction may be stopped after an appropriate period of time and the reaction products precipitated with trichloroacetic acetic acid and filtering onto WHATMAN 3 mM. The specificity of the reaction may be checked by SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis and autoradiography. Incorporation of C tyrosine onto tubulin would be diagnostic of active tubulin tyrosine ligase activity. The skilled artisan would appreciate that appropriate levels of tubulin tyrosine and C tyrosine would need to be emperically determined based upon the Kcat and Km and other catalytic rate constants of the purified BGS 42 polypeptide. The same rate constants would also influence selection of an appropriate incution period.

One skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of polynucleotides of the invention agonists and or antagonists of polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention.

The method of Herman et al. may be followed essentially as described by Herman et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 9821 9826. Briefly breast colon and lung tumor cell lines may be assayed for BGS 42 expression by real time quantitative PCR. Expression levels may be ranked as being either high or low expression. Genomic DNA may be isolated by standard techniques denatured with sodium hydroxide and treated with sodium bisulfite. Two sets of PCR primers may then be designed across several regions upstream of the start of BGS 42 translation that include CpG islands. To amplify the genomic DNA from high expression cell lines non methylated DNA a T may be used in the position 5 to the G where normally a C would reside. To amplify the genomic DNA isolated from the low expressing cell lines methylated DNA the normal C will be used in the position 5 to the G. These primer sets will take advantage of the fact the methylation protects cytosine from conversion to uracil by bisulfite treatment. Using primers with both C and T will distinguish methylated DNA from non methylated. Thus the changes in expression levels between the C and T containing primers will provide evidence that DNA methylation does have an effect on BGS 42 expression in tumor samples relative to normal samples.

One skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of polynucleotides of the invention agonists and or antagonists of polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention.

The physiological function of the BGS 42 polypeptide may be assessed by expressing the sequences encoding BGS 42 at physiologically elevated levels in mammalian cell culture systems. cDNA is subcloned into a mammalian expression vector containing a strong promoter that drives high levels of cDNA expression examples are provided elsewhere herein . Vectors of choice include pCMV SPORT Life Technologies and pCR3.1 Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. both of which contain the cytomegalovirus promoter. 5 10 ug of recombinant vector are transiently transfected into a human cell line preferably of endothelial or hematopoietic origin using either liposome formulations or electroporation. 1 2 ug of an additional plasmid containing sequences encoding a marker protein are cotransfected. Expression of a marker protein provides a means to distinguish transfected cells from nontransfected cells and is a reliable predictor of cDNA expression from the recombinant vector. Marker proteins of choice include e.g. Green Fluorescent Protein GFP Clontech CD64 or a CD64 GFP fusion protein. Flow cytometry FCM an automated laser optics based technique is used to identify transfected cells expressing GFP or CD64 GFP and to evaluate the apoptotic state of the cells and other cellular properties. FCM detects and quantifies the uptake of fluorescent molecules that diagnose events preceding or coincident with cell death. These events include changes in nuclear DNA content as measured by staining of DNA with propidium iodide changes in cell size and granularity as measured by forward light scatter and 90 degree side light scatter down regulation of DNA synthesis as measured by decrease in bromodeoxyuridine uptake alterations in expression of cell surface and intracellular proteins as measured by reactivity with specific antibodies and alterations in plasma membrane composition as measured by the binding of fluorescein conjugated Annexin V protein to the cell surface. Methods in flow cytometry are discussed in Ormerod M. G. 1994 Flow Cvtometrv Oxford N.Y.

The influence of BGS 42 polypeptides on gene expression can be assessed using highly purified populations of cells transfected with sequences encoding BGS 42 and either CD64 or CD64 GFP. CD64 and CD64 GFP are expressed on the surface of transfected cells and bind to conserved regions of human immunoglobulin G IgG . Transfected cells are efficiently separated from nontransfected cells using magnetic beads coated with either human IgG or antibody against CD64 DYNAL Lake Success N.Y. . mRNA can be purified from the cells using methods well known by those of skill in the art. Expression of mRNA encoding BGS 42 polypeptides and other genes of interest can be analyzed by northern analysis or microarray techniques.

The following assays are designed to identify compounds that bind to the BGS 42 polypeptide bind to other cellular proteins that interact with the BGS 42 polypeptide and to compounds that interfere with the interaction of the BGS 42 polypeptide with other cellular proteins.

Such compounds can include but are not limited to other cellular proteins. Specifically such compounds can include but are not limited to peptides such as for example soluble peptides including but not limited to Ig tailed fusion peptides comprising extracellular portions of BGS 42 polypeptide transmembrane receptors and members of random peptide libraries see e.g. Lam K. S. et al. 1991 Nature 354 82 84 Houghton R. et al. 1991 Nature 354 84 86 made of D and or L configuration amino acids phosphopeptides including but not limited to members of random or partially degenerate phosphopeptide libraries see e.g. Songyang Z. et al. 1993 Cell 72 767 778 antibodies including but not limited to polyclonal monoclonal humanized anti idiotypic chimeric or single chain antibodies and FAb F ab .sub.2 and FAb expression libary fragments and epitope binding fragments thereof and small organic or inorganic molecules.

Compounds identified via assays such as those described herein can be useful for example in elaborating the biological function of the BGS 42 polypeptide and for ameliorating symptoms of tumor progression for example. In instances for example whereby a tumor progression state or disorder results from a lower overall level of BGS 42 expression BGS 42 polypeptide and or BGS 42 polypeptide activity in a cell involved in the tumor progression state or disorder compounds that interact with the BGS 42 polypeptide can include ones which accentuate or amplify the activity of the bound BGS 42 polypeptide. Such compounds would bring about an effective increase in the level of BGS 42 polypeptide activity thus ameliorating symptoms of the tumor progression disorder or state. In instances whereby mutations within the BGS 42 polypeptide cause aberrant BGS 42 polypeptides to be made which have a deleterious effect that leads to tumor progression compounds that bind BGS 42 polypeptide can be identified that inhibit the activity of the bound BGS 42 polypeptide. Assays for testing the effectiveness of such compounds are known in the art and discussed elsewhere herein.

In vitro systems can be designed to identify compounds capable of binding the BGS 42 polypeptide of the invention. Compounds identified can be useful for example in modulating the activity of wild type and or mutant BGS 42 polypeptide preferably mutant BGS 42 polypeptide can be useful in elaborating the biological function of the BGS 42 polypeptide can be utilized in screens for identifying compounds that disrupt normal BGS 42 polypeptide interactions or can in themselves disrupt such interactions.

The principle of the assays used to identify compounds that bind to the BGS 42 polypeptide involves preparing a reaction mixture of the BGS 42 polypeptide and the test compound under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the two components to interact and bind thus forming a complex which can be removed and or detected in the reaction mixture. These assays can be conducted in a variety of ways. For example one method to conduct such an assay would involve anchoring BGS 42 polypeptide or the test substance onto a solid phase and detecting BGS 42 polypeptide test compound complexes anchored on the solid phase at the end of the reaction. In one embodiment of such a method the BGS 42 polypeptide can be anchored onto a solid surface and the test compound which is not anchored can be labeled either directly or indirectly.

In practice microtitre plates can conveniently be utilized as the solid phase. The anchored component can be immobilized by non covalent or covalent attachments. Non covalent attachment can be accomplished by simply coating the solid surface with a solution of the protein and drying. Alternatively an immobilized antibody preferably a monoclonal antibody specific for the protein to be immobilized can be used to anchor the protein to the solid surface. The surfaces can be prepared in advance and stored.

In order to conduct the assay the nonimmobilized component is added to the coated surface containing the anchored component. After the reaction is complete unreacted components are removed e.g. by washing under conditions such that any complexes formed will remain immobilized on the solid surface. The detection of complexes anchored on the solid surface can be accomplished in a number of ways. Where the previously immobilized component is pre labeled the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexes were formed. Where the previously nonimmobilized component is not pre labeled an indirect label can be used to detect complexes anchored on the surface e.g. using a labeled antibody specific for the immobilized component the antibody in turn can be directly labeled or indirectly labeled with a labeled anti Ig antibody .

Alternatively a reaction can be conducted in a liquid phase the reaction products separated from unreacted components and complexes detected e.g. using an immobilized antibody specific for BGS 42 polypeptide or the test compound to anchor any complexes formed in solution and a labeled antibody specific for the other component of the possible complex to detect anchored complexes.

The BGS 42 polypeptide of the invention can in vivo interact with one or more cellular or extracellular macromolecules such as proteins. Such macromolecules include but are not limited to polypeptides particularly GPCR ligands and those products identified via screening methods described elsewhere herein. For the purposes of this discussion such cellular and extracellular macromolecules are referred to herein as binding partner s . For the purpose of the present invention binding partner may also encompass polypeptides small molecule compounds polysaccarides lipids and any other molecule or molecule type referenced herein. Compounds that disrupt such interactions can be useful in regulating the activity of the BGS 42 polypeptide especially mutant BGS 42 polypeptide. Such compounds can include but are not limited to molecules such as antibodies peptides and the like described in elsewhere herein.

The basic principle of the assay systems used to identify compounds that interfere with the interaction between the BGS 42 polypeptide and its cellular or extracellular binding partner or partners involves preparing a reaction mixture containing the BGS 42 polypeptide and the binding partner under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the two products to interact and bind thus forming a complex. In order to test a compound for inhibitory activity the reaction mixture is prepared in the presence and absence of the test compound. The test compound can be initially included in the reaction mixture or can be added at a time subsequent to the addition of BGS 42 polypeptide and its cellular or extracellular binding partner. Control reaction mixtures are incubated without the test compound or with a placebo. The formation of any complexes between the BGS 42 polypeptide and the cellular or extracellular binding partner is then detected. The formation of a complex in the control reaction but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound indicates that the compound interferes with the interaction of the BGS 42 polypeptide and the interactive binding partner. Additionally complex formation within reaction mixtures containing the test compound and normal BGS 42 polypeptide can also be compared to complex formation within reaction mixtures containing the test compound and mutant BGS 42 polypeptide. This comparison can be important in those cases wherein it is desirable to identify compounds that disrupt interactions of mutant but not normal BGS 42 polypeptide.

The assay for compounds that interfere with the interaction of the BGS 42 polypeptide and binding partners can be conducted in a heterogeneous or homogeneous format. Heterogeneous assays involve anchoring either the BGS 42 polypeptide or the binding partner onto a solid phase and detecting complexes anchored on the solid phase at the end of the reaction. In homogeneous assays the entire reaction is carried out in a liquid phase. In either approach the order of addition of reactants can be varied to obtain different information about the compounds being tested. For example test compounds that interfere with the interaction between the BGS 42 polypeptide and the binding partners e.g. by competition can be identified by conducting the reaction in the presence of the test substance i.e. by adding the test substance to the reaction mixture prior to or simultaneously with the BGS 42 polypeptide and interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner. Alternatively test compounds that disrupt preformed complexes e.g. compounds with higher binding constants that displace one of the components from the complex can be tested by adding the test compound to the reaction mixture after complexes have been formed. The various formats are described briefly below.

In a heterogeneous assay system either the BGS 42 polypeptide or the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner is anchored onto a solid surface while the non anchored species is labeled either directly or indirectly. In practice microtitre plates are conveniently utilized. The anchored species can be immobilized by non covalent or covalent attachments. Non covalent attachment can be accomplished simply by coating the solid surface with a solution of the BGS 42 polypeptide or binding partner and drying. Alternatively an immobilized antibody specific for the species to be anchored can be used to anchor the species to the solid surface. The surfaces can be prepared in advance and stored.

In order to conduct the assay the partner of the immobilized species is exposed to the coated surface with or without the test compound. After the reaction is complete unreacted components are removed e.g. by washing and any complexes formed will remain immobilized on the solid surface. The detection of complexes anchored on the solid surface can be accomplished in a number of ways. Where the non immobilized species is pre labeled the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexes were formed. Where the non immobilized species is not pre labeled an indirect label can be used to detect complexes anchored on the surface e.g. using a labeled antibody specific for the initially non immobilized species the antibody in turn can be directly labeled or indirectly labeled with a labeled anti Ig antibody . Depending upon the order of addition of reaction components test compounds which inhibit complex formation or which disrupt preformed complexes can be detected.

Alternatively the reaction can be conducted in a liquid phase in the presence or absence of the test compound the reaction products separated from unreacted components and complexes detected e.g. using an immobilized antibody specific for one of the binding components to anchor any complexes formed in solution and a labeled antibody specific for the other partner to detect anchored complexes. Again depending upon the order of addition of reactants to the liquid phase test compounds which inhibit complex or which disrupt preformed complexes can be identified.

In an alternate embodiment of the invention a homogeneous assay can be used. In this approach a preformed complex of the BGS 42 polypeptide and the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner product is prepared in which either the BGS 42 polypeptide or their binding partners are labeled but the signal generated by the label is quenched due to complex formation see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 109 496 by Rubenstein which utilizes this approach for immunoassays . The addition of a test substance that competes with and displaces one of the species from the preformed complex will result in the generation of a signal above background. In this way test substances which disrupt BGS 42 polypeptide cellular or extracellular binding partner interaction can be identified.

In a particular embodiment the BGS 42 polypeptide can be prepared for immobilization using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. For example the BGS 42 polypeptide coding region can be fused to a glutathione S transferase GST gene using a fusion vector such as pGEX 5X 1 in such a manner that its binding activity is maintained in the resulting fusion product. The interactive cellular or extracellular product can be purified and used to raise a monoclonal antibody using methods routinely practiced in the art and described above. This antibody can be labeled with the radioactive isotope sup. 125 I for example by methods routinely practiced in the art. In a heterogeneous assay e.g. the GST BGS 42 polypeptide fusion product can be anchored to glutathione agarose beads. The interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner product can then be added in the presence or absence of the test compound in a manner that allows interaction and binding to occur. At the end of the reaction period unbound material can be washed away and the labeled monoclonal antibody can be added to the system and allowed to bind to the complexed components. The interaction between the BGS 42 polypeptide and the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner can be detected by measuring the amount of radioactivity that remains associated with the glutathione agarose beads. A successful inhibition of the interaction by the test compound will result in a decrease in measured radioactivity.

Alternatively the GST BGS 42 polypeptide fusion product and the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner product can be mixed together in liquid in the absence of the solid glutathione agarose beads. The test compound can be added either during or after the binding partners are allowed to interact. This mixture can then be added to the glutathione agarose beads and unbound material is washed away. Again the extent of inhibition of the binding partner interaction can be detected by adding the labeled antibody and measuring the radioactivity associated with the beads.

In another embodiment of the invention these same techniques can be employed using peptide fragments that correspond to the binding domains of the BGS 42 polypeptide product and the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner in case where the binding partner is a product in place of one or both of the full length products.

Any number of methods routinely practiced in the art can be used to identify and isolate the protein s binding site. These methods include but are not limited to mutagenesis of one of the genes encoding one of the products and screening for disruption of binding in a co immunoprecipitation assay. Compensating mutations in the gene encoding the second species in the complex can be selected. Sequence analysis of the genes encoding the respective products will reveal the mutations that correspond to the region of the product involved in interactive binding. Alternatively one product can be anchored to a solid surface using methods described in this Section above and allowed to interact with and bind to its labeled binding partner which has been treated with a proteolytic enzyme such as trypsin. After washing a short labeled peptide comprising the binding domain can remain associated with the solid material which can be isolated and identified by amino acid sequencing. Also once the gene coding for the cellular or extracellular binding partner product is obtained short gene segments can be engineered to express peptide fragments of the product which can then be tested for binding activity and purified or synthesized.

The deposited material in the sample assigned the ATCC Deposit Number cited in Table I for any given cDNA clone also may contain one or more additional plasmids each comprising a cDNA clone different from that given clone. Thus deposits sharing the same ATCC Deposit Number contain at least a plasmid for each cDNA clone identified in Table I. Typically each ATCC deposit sample cited in Table I comprises a mixture of approximately equal amounts by weight of about 1 10 plasmid DNAs each containing a different cDNA clone and or partial cDNA clone but such a deposit sample may include plasmids for more or less than 2 cDNA clones.

Two approaches can be used to isolate a particular clone from the deposited sample of plasmid DNA s cited for that clone in Table I. First a plasmid is directly isolated by screening the clones using a polynucleotide probe corresponding to SEQ ID NO 1.

Particularly a specific polynucleotide with 30 40 nucleotides is synthesized using an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer according to the sequence reported. The oligonucleotide is labeled for instance with 32P ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified according to routine methods. E.g. Maniatis et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Press Cold Spring N.Y. 1982 . The plasmid mixture is transformed into a suitable host as indicated above such as XL 1 Blue Stratagene using techniques known to those of skill in the art such as those provided by the vector supplier or in related publications or patents cited above. The transformants are plated on 1.5 agar plates containing the appropriate selection agent e.g. ampicillin to a density of about 150 transformants colonies per plate. These plates are screened using Nylon membranes according to routine methods for bacterial colony screening e.g. Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2nd Edit. 1989 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press pages 1.93 to 1.104 or other techniques known to those of skill in the art.

Alternatively two primers of 17 20 nucleotides derived from both ends of the SEQ ID NO 1 i.e. within the region of SEQ ID NO 1 bounded by the 5 NT and the 3 NT of the clone defined in Table I are synthesized and used to amplify the desired cDNA using the deposited cDNA plasmid as a template. The polymerase chain reaction is carried out under routine conditions for instance in 25 ul of reaction mixture with 0.5 ug of the above cDNA template. A convenient reaction mixture is 1.5 5 mM MgCl2 0.01 w v gelatin 20 uM each of dATP dCTP dGTP dTTP 25 pmol of each primer and 0.25 Unit of Taq polymerase. Thirty five cycles of PCR denaturation at 94 degree C. for 1 min annealing at 55 degree C. for 1 min elongation at 72 degree C. for 1 min are performed with a Perkin Elmer Cetus automated thermal cycler. The amplified product is analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the DNA band with expected molecular weight is excised and purified. The PCR product is verified to be the selected sequence by subcloning and sequencing the DNA product.

The polynucleotide s of the present invention the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of the present invention or the polypeptide encoded by the deposited clone may represent partial or incomplete versions of the complete coding region i.e. full length gene . Several methods are known in the art for the identification of the 5 or 3 non coding and or coding portions of a gene which may not be present in the deposited clone. The methods that follow are exemplary and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. These methods include but are not limited to filter probing clone enrichment using specific probes and protocols similar or identical to 5 and 3 RACE protocols that are well known in the art. For instance a method similar to 5 RACE is available for generating the missing 5 end of a desired full length transcript. Fromont Racine et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 21 7 1683 1684 1993 .

Briefly a specific RNA oligonucleotide is ligated to the 5 ends of a population of RNA presumably containing full length gene RNA transcripts. A primer set containing a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to a known sequence of the gene of interest is used to PCR amplify the 5 portion of the desired full length gene. This amplified product may then be sequenced and used to generate the full length gene.

This above method starts with total RNA isolated from the desired source although poly A RNA can be used. The RNA preparation can then be treated with phosphatase if necessary to eliminate 5 phosphate groups on degraded or damaged RNA that may interfere with the later RNA ligase step. The phosphatase should then be inactivated and the RNA treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase in order to remove the cap structure present at the 5 ends of messenger RNAs. This reaction leaves a 5 phosphate group at the 5 end of the cap cleaved RNA which can then be ligated to an RNA oligonucleotide using T4 RNA ligase.

This modified RNA preparation is used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis using a gene specific oligonucleotide. The first strand synthesis reaction is used as a template for PCR amplification of the desired 5 end using a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to the known sequence of the gene of interest. The resultant product is then sequenced and analyzed to confirm that the 5 end sequence belongs to the desired gene. Moreover it may be advantageous to optimize the RACE protocol to increase the probability of isolating additional 5 or 3 coding or non coding sequences. Various methods of optimizing a RACE protocol are known in the art though a detailed description summarizing these methods can be found in B. C. Schaefer Anal. Biochem. 227 255 273 1995 .

An alternative method for carrying out 5 or 3 RACE for the identification of coding or non coding sequences is provided by Frohman M. A. et al. Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 85 8998 9002 1988 . Briefly a cDNA clone missing either the 5 or 3 end can be reconstructed to include the absent base pairs extending to the translational start or stop codon respectively. In some cases cDNAs are missing the start of translation therefor. The following briefly describes a modification of this original 5 RACE procedure. Poly A or total RNAs reverse transcribed with SUPERSCRIPT II Gibco BRL and an antisense or I complementary primer specific to the cDNA sequence. The primer is removed from the reaction with a MICROCON Concentrator Amicon . The first strand cDNA is then tailed with dATP and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase Gibco BRL . Thus an anchor sequence is produced which is needed for PCR amplification. The second strand is synthesized from the dA tail in PCR buffer Taq DNA polymerase Perkin Elmer Cetus an oligo dT primer containing three adjacent restriction sites XhoIJ Sail and ClaI at the 5 end and a primer containing just these restriction sites. This double stranded cDNA is PCR amplified for 40 cycles with the same primers as well as a nested cDNA specific antisense primer. The PCR products are size separated on an ethidium bromide agarose gel and the region of gel containing cDNA products the predicted size of missing protein coding DNA is removed. cDNA is purified from the agarose with the Magic PCR Prep kit Promega restriction digested with XhoI or SalI and ligated to a plasmid such as PBLUESCRIPT SKII Stratagene at XhoI and EcoRV sites. This DNA is transformed into bacteria and the plasmid clones sequenced to identify the correct protein coding inserts. Correct 5 ends are confirmed by comparing this sequence with the putatively identified homologue and overlap with the partial cDNA clone. Similar methods known in the art and or commercial kits are used to amplify and recover 3 ends.

Several quality controlled kits are commercially available for purchase. Similar reagents and methods to those above are supplied in kit form from Gibco BRL for both 5 and 3 RACE for recovery of full length genes. A second kit is available from Clontech which is a modification of a related technique SLIC single stranded ligation to single stranded cDNA developed by Dumas et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 19 5227 32 1991 . The major differences in procedure are that the RNA is alkaline hydrolyzed after reverse transcription and RNA ligase is used to join a restriction site containing anchor primer to the first strand cDNA. This obviates the necessity for the dA tailing reaction which results in a polyT stretch that is difficult to sequence past.

An alternative to generating 5 or 3 cDNA from RNA is to use cDNA library double stranded DNA. An asymmetric PCR amplified antisense cDNA strand is synthesized with an antisense cDNA specific primer and a plasmid anchored primer. These primers are removed and a symmetric PCR reaction is performed with a nested cDNA specific antisense primer and the plasmid anchored primer.

Once a gene of interest is identified several methods are available for the identification of the 5 or 3 portions of the gene which may not be present in the original cDNA plasmid. These methods include but are not limited to filter probing clone enrichment using specific probes and protocols similar and identical to 5 and 3 RACE. While the full length gene may be present in the library and can be identified by probing a useful method for generating the 5 or 3 end is to use the existing sequence information from the original cDNA to generate the missing information. A method similar to 5 RACE is available for generating the missing 5 end of a desired full length gene. This method was published by Fromont Racine et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 21 7 1683 1684 1993 . Briefly a specific RNA oligonucleotide is ligated to the 5 ends of a population of RNA presumably 30 containing full length gene RNA transcript and a primer set containing a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to a known sequence of the gene of interest is used to PCR amplify the 5 portion of the desired full length gene which may then be sequenced and used to generate the full length gene. This method starts with total RNA isolated from the desired source poly A RNA may be used but is not a prerequisite for this procedure. The RNA preparation may then be treated with phosphatase if necessary to eliminate 5 phosphate groups on degraded or damaged RNA which may interfere with the later RNA ligase step. The phosphatase if used is then inactivated and the RNA is treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase in order to remove the cap structure present at the 5 ends of messenger RNAs. This reaction leaves a 5 phosphate group at the 5 end of the cap cleaved RNA which can then be ligated to an RNA oligonucleotide using T4 RNA ligase. This modified RNA preparation can then be used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis using a gene specific oligonucleotide. The first strand synthesis reaction can then be used as a template for PCR amplification of the desired 5 end using a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to the known sequence of the apoptosis related of interest. The resultant product is then sequenced and analyzed to confirm that the 5 end sequence belongs to the relevant apoptosis related.

A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is amplified using PCR oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5 and 3 ends of the DNA sequence as outlined in Example 13 to synthesize insertion fragments. The primers used to amplify the cDNA insert should preferably contain restriction sites such as BamHI and XbaI at the 5 end of the primers in order to clone the amplified product into the expression vector. For example BamHI and XbaI correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the bacterial expression vector pQE 9. Qiagen Inc. Chatsworth Calif. . This plasmid vector encodes antibiotic resistance Ampr a bacterial origin of replication ori an IPTG regulatable promoter operator P O a ribosome binding site RBS a 6 histidine tag 6 His and restriction enzyme cloning sites.

The pQE 9 vector is digested with BamHI and XbaI and the amplified fragment is ligated into the pQE 9 vector maintaining the reading frame initiated at the bacterial RBS. The ligation mixture is then used to transform the strain M15 rep4 Qiagen Inc. which contains multiple copies of the plasmid pREP4 that expresses the lacI repressor and also confers kanamycin resistance Kanr . Transformants are identified by their ability to grow on LB plates and ampicillin kanamycin resistant colonies are selected. Plasmid DNA is isolated and confirmed by restriction analysis.

Clones containing the desired constructs are grown overnight O N in liquid culture in LB media supplemented with both Amp 100 ug ml and Kan 25 ug ml . The O N culture is used to inoculate a large culture at a ratio of 1 100 to 1 250. The cells are grown to an optical density 600 O.D.600 of between 0.4 and 0.6. IPTG Isopropyl B D thiogalacto pyranoside is then added to a final concentration of i mM. IPTG induces by inactivating the lacI repressor clearing the P O leading to increased gene expression.

Cells are grown for an extra 3 to 4 hours. Cells are then harvested by centrifugation 20 mins at 6000 g . The cell pellet is solubilized in the chaotropic agent 6 Molar Guanidine HCl by stirring for 3 4 hours at 4 degree C. The cell debris is removed by centrifugation and the supernatant containing the polypeptide is loaded onto a nickel nitrilo tri acetic acid Ni NTA affinity resin column available from QIAGEN Inc. supra . Proteins with a 6 His tag bind to the Ni NTA resin with high affinity and can be purified in a simple one step procedure for details see The QIAexpressionist 1995 QIAGEN Inc. supra .

Briefly the supernatant is loaded onto the column in 6 M guanidine HCl pH 8 the column is first washed with 10 volumes of 6 M guanidine HCl pH 8 then washed with 10 volumes of 6 M guanidine HCl pH 6 and finally the polypeptide is eluted with 6 M guanidine HCl pH 5.

The purified protein is then renatured by dialyzing it against phosphate buffered saline PBS or 50 mM Na acetate pH 6 buffer plus 200 mM NaCl. Alternatively the protein can be successfully refolded while immobilized on the Ni NTA column. The recommended conditions are as follows renature using a linear 6M 1M urea gradient in 500 mM NaCl 20 glycerol 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 containing protease inhibitors. The renaturation should be performed over a period of 1.5 hours or more. After renaturation the proteins are eluted by the addition of 250 mM imidazole. Imidazole is removed by a final dialyzing step against PBS or 50 mM sodium acetate pH 6 buffer plus 200 mM NaCl. The purified protein is stored at 4 degree C. or frozen at 80 degree C.

The following alternative method can be used to purify a polypeptide expressed in when it is present in the form of inclusion bodies. Unless otherwise specified all of the following steps are conducted at 4 10 degree C.

Upon completion of the production phase of the fermentation the cell culture is cooled to 4 10 degree C. and the cells harvested by continuous centrifugation at 15 000 rpm Heraeus Sepatech . On the basis of the expected yield of protein per unit weight of cell paste and the amount of purified protein required an appropriate amount of cell paste by weight is suspended in a buffer solution containing 100 mM Tris 50 mM EDTA pH 7.4. The cells are dispersed to a homogeneous suspension using a high shear mixer.

The cells are then lysed by passing the solution through a microfluidizer Microfluidics Corp. or APV Gaulin Inc. twice at 4000 6000 psi. The homogenate is then mixed with NaCl solution to a final concentration of 0.5 M NaCl followed by centrifugation at 7000 g for 15 min. The resultant pellet is washed again using 0.5M NaCl 100 mM Tris 50 mM EDTA pH 7.4.

The resulting washed inclusion bodies are solubilized with 1.5 M guanidine hydrochloride GuHCl for 2 4 hours. After 7000 g centrifugation for 15 min. the pellet is discarded and the polypeptide containing supernatant is incubated at 4 degree C. overnight to allow further GuHCl extraction.

Following high speed centrifugation 30 000 g to remove insoluble particles the GuHCl solubilized protein is refolded by quickly mixing the GuHCl extract with 20 volumes of buffer containing 50 mM sodium pH 4.5 150 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA by vigorous stirring. The refolded diluted protein solution is kept at 4 degree C. without mixing for 12 hours prior to further purification steps.

To clarify the refolded polypeptide solution a previously prepared tangential filtration unit equipped with 0.16 um membrane filter with appropriate surface area e.g. Filtron equilibrated with 40 mM sodium acetate pH 6.0 is employed. The filtered sample is loaded onto a cation exchange resin e.g. Poros HS 50 Perceptive Biosystems . The column is washed with 40 mM sodium acetate pH 6.0 and eluted with 250 mM 500 mM 1000 mM and 1500 mM NaCl in the same buffer in a stepwise manner. The absorbance at 280 nm of the effluent is continuously monitored. Fractions are collected and further analyzed by SDS PAGE.

Fractions containing the polypeptide are then pooled and mixed with 4 volumes of water. The diluted sample is then loaded onto a previously prepared set of tandem columns of strong anion Poros HQ 50 Perceptive Biosystems and weak anion Poros CM 20 Perceptive Biosystems exchange resins. The columns are equilibrated with 40 mM sodium acetate pH 6.0. Both columns are washed with 40 mM sodium acetate pH 6.0 200 mM NaCl. The CM 20 column is then eluted using a 10 column volume linear gradient ranging from 0.2 M NaCl 50 mM sodium acetate pH 6.0 to 1.0 M NaCl 50 mM sodium acetate pH 6.5. Fractions are collected under constant A280 monitoring of the effluent. Fractions containing the polypeptide determined for instance by 16 SDS PAGE are then pooled.

The resultant polypeptide should exhibit greater than 95 purity after the above refolding and purification steps. No major contaminant bands should be observed from Coomassie blue stained 16 SDS PAGE gel when 5 ug of purified protein is loaded. The purified protein can also be tested for endotoxin LPS contamination and typically the LPS content is less than 0.1 ng ml according to LAL assays.

In this example the plasmid shuttle vector pAc373 is used to insert a polynucleotide into a baculovirus to express a polypeptide. A typical baculovirus expression vector contains the strong polyhedrin promoter of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcMNPV followed by convenient restriction sites which may include for example BamHI Xba I and Asp718. The polyadenylation site of the simian virus 40 SV40 is often used for efficient polyadenylation. For easy selection of recombinant virus the plasmid contains the beta galactosidase gene from under control of a weak promoter in the same orientation followed by the polyadenylation signal of the polyhedrin gene. The inserted genes are flanked on both sides by viral sequences for cell mediated homologous recombination with wild type viral DNA to generate a viable virus that express the cloned polynucleotide.

Many other baculovirus vectors can be used in place of the vector above such as pVL941 and pAcIM1 as one skilled in the art would readily appreciate as long as the construct provides appropriately located signals for transcription translation secretion and the like including a signal peptide and an in frame AUG as required. Such vectors are described for instance in Luckow et al. Virology 170 31 39 1989 .

A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is amplified using PCR oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5 and 3 ends of the DNA sequence as outlined in Example 13 to synthesize insertion fragments. The primers used to amplify the cDNA insert should preferably contain restriction sites at the 5 end of the primers in order to clone the amplified product into the expression vector. Specifically the cDNA sequence contained in the deposited clone including the AUG initiation codon and the naturally associated leader sequence identified elsewhere herein if applicable is amplified using the PCR protocol described in Example 13. If the naturally occurring signal sequence is used to produce the protein the vector used does not need a second signal peptide. Alternatively the vector can be modified to include a baculovirus leader sequence using the standard methods described in Summers et al. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures Texas Agricultural Experimental Station Bulletin No. 1555 1987 .

The amplified fragment is isolated from a 1 agarose gel using a commercially available kit GENECLEAN BIO 101 Inc. La Jolla Calif. . The fragment then is digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and again purified on a 1 agarose gel.

The plasmid is digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes and optionally can be dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase using routine procedures known in the art. The DNA is then isolated from a 1 agarose gel using a commercially available kit GENECLEAN BIO 101 Inc. La Jolla Calif. .

The fragment and the dephosphorylated plasmid are ligated together with T4 DNA ligase. HB101 or other suitable hosts such as XL 1 Blue Stratagene Cloning Systems La Jolla Calif. cells are transformed with the ligation mixture and spread on culture plates. Bacteria containing the plasmid are identified by digesting DNA from individual colonies and analyzing the digestion product by gel electrophoresis. The sequence of the cloned fragment is confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Five ug of a plasmid containing the polynucleotide is co transformed with 1.0 ug of a commercially available linearized baculovirus DNA BACULOGOLD baculovirus DNA Pharmingen San Diego Calif. using the lipofection method described by Felgner et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 7413 7417 1987 . One ug of BACULOGOLD virus DNA and 5 ug of the plasmid are mixed in a sterile well of a microtiter plate containing 50 ul of serum free Grace s medium Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg Md. . Afterwards 10 ul LIPOFECTIN plus 90 ul Grace s medium are added mixed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then the transfection mixture is added drop wise to Sf9 insect cells ATCC CRL 1711 seeded in a 35 mm tissue culture plate with 1 ml Grace s medium without serum. The plate is then incubated for 5 hours at 27 degrees C. The transfection solution is then removed from the plate and 1 ml of Grace s insect medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum is added. Cultivation is then continued at 27 degrees C. for four days.

After four days the supernatant is collected and a plaque assay is performed as described by Summers and Smith supra. An agarose gel with Blue Gal Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg is used to allow easy identification and isolation of gal expressing clones which produce blue stained plaques. A detailed description of a plaque assay of this type can also be found in the user s guide for insect cell culture and baculovirology distributed by Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg page 9 10. After appropriate incubation blue stained plaques are picked with the tip of a micropipettor e.g. Eppendorf . The agar containing the recombinant viruses is then resuspended in a microcentrifuge tube containing 200 ul of Grace s medium and the suspension containing the recombinant baculovirus is used to infect Sf9 cells seeded in 35 mm dishes. Four days later the supernatants of these culture dishes are harvested and then they are stored at 4 degree C.

To verify the expression of the polypeptide Sf9 cells are grown in Grace s medium supplemented with 10 heat inactivated FBS. The cells are infected with the recombinant baculovirus containing the polynucleotide at a multiplicity of infection MOI of about 2. If radiolabeled proteins are desired 6 hours later the medium is removed and is replaced with SF900 II medium minus methionine and cysteine available from Life Technologies Inc. Rockville Md. . After 42 hours 5 uCi of 35S methionine and 5 uCi 35S cysteine available from Amersham are added. The cells are further incubated for 16 hours and then are harvested by centrifugation. The proteins in the supernatant as well as the intracellular proteins are analyzed by SDS PAGE followed by autoradiography if radiolabeled .

Microsequencing of the amino acid sequence of the amino terminus of purified protein may be used to determine the amino terminal sequence of the produced protein.

The polypeptide of the present invention can be expressed in a mammalian cell. A typical mammalian expression vector contains a promoter element which mediates the initiation of transcription of mRNA a protein coding sequence and signals required for the termination of transcription and polyadenylation of the transcript. Additional elements include enhancers Kozak sequences and intervening sequences flanked by donor and acceptor sites for RNA splicing. Highly efficient transcription is achieved with the early and late promoters from SV40 the long terminal repeats LTRs from Retroviruses e.g. RSV HTLVI HIVI and the early promoter of the cytomegalovirus CMV . However cellular elements can also be used e.g. the human actin promoter .

Suitable expression vectors for use in practicing the present invention include for example vectors such as pSVL and pMSG Pharmacia Uppsala Sweden pRSVcat ATCC 37152 pSV2dhfr ATCC 37146 pBC12MI ATCC 67109 pCMVSport 2.0 and pCMVSport 3.0. Mammalian host cells that could be used include human Hela 293 H9 and Jurkat cells mouse NIH3T3 and C127 cells Cos 1 Cos 7 and CV1 quail QC1 3 cells mouse L cells and Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells.

Alternatively the polypeptide can be expressed in stable cell lines containing the polynucleotide integrated into a chromosome. The co transformation with a selectable marker such as dhfr gpt neomycin hygromycin allows the identification and isolation of the transformed cells.

The transformed gene can also be amplified to express large amounts of the encoded protein. The DHFR dihydrofolate reductase marker is useful in developing cell lines that carry several hundred or even several thousand copies of the gene of interest. See e.g. Alt F. W. et al. J. Biol. Chem. . . . 253 1357 1370 1978 Hamlin J. L. and Ma C. Biochem. et Biophys. Acta 1097 107 143 1990 Page M. J. and Sydenham M. A. Biotechnology 9 64 68 1991 . Another useful selection marker is the enzyme glutamine synthase GS Murphy et al. Biochem J. 227 277 279 1991 Bebbington et al. Bio Technology 10 169 175 1992 . Using these markers the mammalian cells are grown in selective medium and the cells with the highest resistance are selected. These cell lines contain the amplified gene s integrated into a chromosome. Chinese hamster ovary CHO and NSO cells are often used for the production of proteins.

A polynucleotide of the present invention is amplified according to the protocol outlined in herein. If the naturally occurring signal sequence is used to produce the protein the vector does not need a second signal peptide. Alternatively if the naturally occurring signal sequence is not used the vector can be modified to include a heterologous signal sequence. See e.g. WO 96 34891. The amplified fragment is isolated from a 1 agarose gel using a commercially available kit GENECLEAN BIO 101 Inc. La Jolla Calif. . The fragment then is digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and again purified on a 1 agarose gel.

The amplified fragment is then digested with the same restriction enzyme and purified on a 1 agarose gel. The isolated fragment and the dephosphorylated vector are then ligated with T4 DNA ligase. HB101 or XL 1 Blue cells are then transformed and bacteria are identified that contain the fragment inserted into plasmid pC6 using for instance restriction enzyme analysis.

Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking an active DHFR gene is used for transformation. Five g of an expression plasmid is cotransformed with 0.5 ug of the plasmid pSVneo using lipofectin Felgner et al. supra . The plasmid pSV2 neo contains a dominant selectable marker the neo gene from Tn5 encoding an enzyme that confers resistance to a group of antibiotics including G418. The cells are seeded in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 1 mg ml G418. After 2 days the cells are trypsinized and seeded in hybridoma cloning plates Greiner Germany in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 10 25 or 50 ng ml of methotrexate plus 1 mg ml G418. After about 10 14 days single clones are trypsinized and then seeded in 6 well petri dishes or 10 ml flasks using different concentrations of methotrexate 50 nM 100 nM 200 nM 400 nM 800 nM . Clones growing at the highest concentrations of methotrexate are then transferred to new 6 well plates containing even higher concentrations of methotrexate 1 uM 2 uM 5 uM 10 mM 20 mM . The same procedure is repeated until clones are obtained which grow at a concentration of 100 200 uM. Expression of the desired gene product is analyzed for instance by SDS PAGE and Western blot or by reversed phase HPLC analysis.

As described elsewhere herein the present invention encompasses the creation of N and C terminal deletion mutants in addition to any combination of N and C terminal deletions thereof corresponding to the BGS 42 polypeptide of the present invention. A number of methods are available to one skilled in the art for creating such mutants. Such methods may include a combination of PCR amplification and gene cloning methodology. Although one of skill in the art of molecular biology through the use of the teachings provided or referenced herein and or otherwise known in the art as standard methods could readily create each deletion mutant of the present invention exemplary methods are described below.

Briefly using the isolated cDNA clone encoding the full length BGS 42 polypeptide sequence as described in Example 13 for example appropriate primers of about 15 25 nucleotides derived from the desired 5 and 3 positions of SEQ ID NO 1 may be designed to PCR amplify and subsequently clone the intended N and or C terminal deletion mutant. Such primers could comprise for example an initiation and stop codon for the 5 and 3 primer respectively. Such primers may also comprise restriction sites to facilitate cloning of the deletion mutant post amplification. Moreover the primers may comprise additional sequences such as for example flag tag sequences kozac sequences or other sequences discussed and or referenced herein.

For example in the case of the E89 to G306 N terminal deletion mutant the following primers could be used to amplify a cDNA fragment corresponding to this deletion mutant 

For example in the case of the M1 to D171 C terminal deletion mutant the following primers could be used to amplify a cDNA fragment corresponding to this deletion mutant 

Representative PCR amplification conditions are provided below although the skilled artisan would appreciate that other conditions may be required for efficient amplification. A 100 ul PCR reaction mixture may be prepared using 10 ng of the template DNA cDNA clone of BGS 42 200 uM 4dNTPs 1 uM primers 0.25 U Taq DNA polymerase PE and standard Taq DNA polymerase buffer. Typical PCR cycling condition are as follows 

After the final extension step of PCR 5 U Klenow Fragment may be added and incubated for 15 min at 30 degrees.

Upon digestion of the fragment with the NotI and SalI restriction enzymes the fragment could be cloned into an appropriate expression and or cloning vector which has been similarly digested e.g. pSport1 among others . The skilled artisan would appreciate that other plasmids could be equally substituted and may be desirable in certain circumstances. The digested fragment and vector are then ligated using a DNA ligase and then used to transform competent cells using methods provided herein and or otherwise known in the art.

The 5 primer sequence for amplifying any additional N terminal deletion mutants may be determined by reference to the following formula S X 3 to S X 3 25 wherein S is equal to the nucleotide position of the initiating start codon of the BGS 42 gene SEQ ID NO 1 and X is equal to the most N terminal amino acid of the intended N terminal deletion mutant. The first term will provide the start 5 nucleotide position of the 5 primer while the second term will provide the end 3 nucleotide position of the 5 primer corresponding to sense strand of SEQ ID NO 1. Once the corresponding nucleotide positions of the primer are determined the final nucleotide sequence may be created by the addition of applicable restriction site sequences to the 5 end of the sequence for example. As referenced herein the addition of other sequences to the 5 primer may be desired in certain circumstances e.g. kozac sequences etc. .

The 3 primer sequence for amplifying any additional N terminal deletion mutants may be determined by reference to the following formula S X 3 to S X 3 25 wherein S is equal to the nucleotide position of the initiating start codon of the BGS 42 gene SEQ ID NO 1 and X is equal to the most C terminal amino acid of the intended N terminal deletion mutant. The first term will provide the start 5 nucleotide position of the 3 primer while the second term will provide the end 3 nucleotide position of the 3 primer corresponding to the anti sense strand of SEQ ID NO 1. Once the corresponding nucleotide positions of the primer are determined the final nucleotide sequence may be created by the addition of applicable restriction site sequences to the 5 end of the sequence for example. As referenced herein the addition of other sequences to the 3 primer may be desired in certain circumstances e.g. stop codon sequences etc. . The skilled artisan would appreciate that modifications of the above nucleotide positions may be necessary for optimizing PCR amplification.

The same general formulas provided above may be used in identifying the 5 and 3 primer sequences for amplifying any C terminal deletion mutant of the present invention. Moreover the same general formulas provided above may be used in identifying the 5 and 3 primer sequences for amplifying any combination of N terminal and C terminal deletion mutant of the present invention. The skilled artisan would appreciate that modifications of the above nucleotide positions may be necessary for optimizing PCR amplification.

The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably fused to other proteins. These fusion proteins can be used for a variety of applications. For example fusion of the present polypeptides to His tag HA tag protein A IgG domains and maltose binding protein facilitates purification. See Example described herein see also EP A 394 827 Traunecker et al. Nature 331 84 86 1988 . Similarly fusion to IgG 1 IgG 3 and albumin increases the half life time in vivo. Nuclear localization signals fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can target the protein to a specific subcellular localization while covalent heterodimer or homodimers can increase or decrease the activity of a fusion protein. Fusion proteins can also create chimeric molecules having more than one function. Finally fusion proteins can increase solubility and or stability of the fused protein compared to the non fused protein. All of the types of fusion proteins described above can be made by modifying the following protocol which outlines the fusion of a polypeptide to an IgG molecule.

Briefly the human Fc portion of the IgG molecule can be PCR amplified using primers that span the 5 and 3 ends of the sequence described below. These primers also should have convenient restriction enzyme sites that will facilitate cloning into an expression vector preferably a mammalian expression vector. Note that the polynucleotide is cloned without a stop codon otherwise a fusion protein will not be produced.

The naturally occurring signal sequence may be used to produce the protein if applicable . Alternatively if the naturally occurring signal sequence is not used the vector can be modified to include a heterologous signal sequence. See e.g. WO 96 34891 and or U.S. Pat. No. 6 066 781 supra. 

As described more particularly herein proteins regulate diverse cellular processes in higher organisms ranging from rapid metabolic changes to growth and differentiation. Increased production of specific proteins could be used to prevent certain diseases and or disease states. Thus the ability to modulate the expression of specific proteins in an organism would provide significant benefits.

Numerous methods have been developed to date for introducing foreign genes either under the control of an inducible constitutively active or endogenous promoter into organisms. Of particular interest are the inducible promoters see M. Gossen et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 89 5547 1992 Y. Wang et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 8180 1994 D. No. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 3346 1996 and V. M. Rivera et al. Nature Med 2 1028 1996 in addition to additional examples disclosed elsewhere herein . In one example the gene for erthropoietin Epo was transferred into mice and primates under the control of a small molecule inducer for expression e.g. tetracycline or rapamycin see D. Bohl et al. Blood 92 1512 1998 K. G. Rendahl et al. Nat. Biotech 16 757 1998 V. M. Rivera et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96 8657 1999 and X. Ye et al. Science 283 88 1999 . Although such systems enable efficient induction of the gene of interest in the organism upon addition of the inducing agent i.e. tetracycline rapamycin etc. the levels of expression tend to peak at 24 hours and trail off to background levels after 4 to 14 days. Thus controlled transient expression is virtually impossible using these systems though such control would be desirable.

A new alternative method of controlling gene expression levels of a protein from a transgene i.e. includes stable and transient transformants has recently been elucidated V. M. Rivera. et al. Science 287 826 830 2000 . This method does not control gene expression at the level of the mRNA like the aforementioned systems. Rather the system controls the level of protein in an active secreted form. In the absence of the inducing agent the protein aggregates in the ER and is not secreted. However addition of the inducing agent results in dis aggregation of the protein and the subsequent secretion from the ER. Such a system affords low basal secretion rapid high level secretion in the presence of the inducing agent and rapid cessation of secretion upon removal of the inducing agent. In fact protein secretion reached a maximum level within 30 minutes of induction and a rapid cessation of secretion within 1 hour of removing the inducing agent. The method is also applicable for controlling the level of production for membrane proteins.

Fusion protein constructs are created using polynucleotide sequences of the present invention with one or more copies preferably at least 2 3 4 or more of a conditional aggregation domain CAD a domain that interacts with itself in a ligand reversible manner i.e. in the presence of an inducing agent using molecular biology methods known in the art and discussed elsewhere herein. The CAD domain may be the mutant domain isolated from the human FKBP12 Pheto Met protein as disclosed in V. M. Rivera. et al. Science 287 826 830 2000 or alternatively other proteins having domains with similar ligand reversible self aggregation properties. As a principle of design the fusion protein vector would contain a furin cleavage sequence operably linked between the polynucleotides of the present invention and the CAD domains. Such a cleavage site would enable the proteolytic cleavage of the CAD domains from the polypeptide of the present invention subsequent to secretion from the ER and upon entry into the trans Golgi J. B. Denault et al. FEBS Lett. 379 113 1996 . Alternatively the skilled artisan would recognize that any proteolytic cleavage sequence could be substituted for the furin sequence provided the substituted sequence is cleavable either endogenously e.g. the furin sequence or exogenously e.g. post secretion post purification post production etc. . The preferred sequence of each feature of the fusion protein construct from the 5 to 3 direction with each feature being operably linked to the other would be a promoter signal sequence X number of CAD x domains the furin sequence or other proteolytic sequence and the coding sequence of the polypeptide of the present invention. The artisan would appreciate that the promotor and signal sequence independent from the other could be either the endogenous promotor or signal sequence of a polypeptide of the present invention or alternatively could be a heterologous signal sequence and promotor.

The specific methods described herein for controlling protein secretion levels through controlled ER aggregation are not meant to be limiting are would be generally applicable to any of the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention including variants homologues orthologs and fragments therein.

Many eukaryotic cell surface and proteins are post translationally processed to incorporate N linked and O linked carbohydrates Kornfeld and Kornfeld 1985 Annu. Rev. Biochem. 54 631 64 Rademacher et al. 1988 Annu. Rev. Biochem. 57 785 838 . Protein glycosylation is thought to serve a variety of functions including augmentation of protein folding inhibition of protein aggregation regulation of intracellular trafficking to organelles increasing resistance to proteolysis modulation of protein antigenicity and mediation of intercellular adhesion Fieldler and Simons 1995 Cell 81 309 312 Helenius 1994 Mol. Biol. Of the Cell 5 253 265 Olden et al. 1978 Cell 13 461 473 Caton et al. 1982 Cell 37 417 427 Alexamnder and Elder 1984 Science 226 1328 1330 and Flack et al. 1994 J. Biol. Chem. 269 14015 14020 . In higher organisms the nature and extent of glycosylation can markedly affect the circulating half life and bio availability of proteins by mechanisms involving receptor mediated uptake and clearance Ashwell and Morrell 1974 Adv. Enzymol. 41 99 128 Ashwell and Harford 1982 Ann. Rev. Biochem. 51 531 54 . Receptor systems have been identified that are thought to play a major role in the clearance of serum proteins through recognition of various carbohydrate structures on the glycoproteins Stockert 1995 Physiol. Rev. 75 591 609 Kery et al. 1992 Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 298 49 55 . Thus production strategies resulting in incomplete attachment of terminal sialic acid residues might provide a means of shortening the bioavailability and half life of glycoproteins. Conversely expression strategies resulting in saturation of terminal sialic acid attachment sites might lengthen protein bioavailability and half life.

In the development of recombinant glycoproteins for use as pharmaceutical products for example it has been speculated that the pharmacodynamics of recombinant proteins can be modulated by the addition or deletion of glycosylation sites from a glycoproteins primary structure Berman and Lasky 1985a Trends in Biotechnol. 3 51 53 . However studies have reported that the deletion of N linked glycosylation sites often impairs intracellular transport and results in the intracellular accumulation of glycosylation site variants Machamer and Rose 1988 J. Biol. Chem. 263 5955 5960 Gallagher et al. 1992 J. Virology. 66 7136 7145 Collier et al. 1993 Biochem. 32 7818 7823 Claffey et al. 1995 Biochemica et Biophysica Acta 1246 1 9 Dube et al. 1988 J. Biol. Chem. 263 17516 17521 . While glycosylation site variants of proteins can be expressed intracellularly it has proved difficult to recover useful quantities from growth conditioned cell culture medium.

Moreover it is unclear to what extent a glycosylation site in one species will be recognized by another species glycosylation machinery. Due to the importance of glycosylation in protein metabolism particularly the secretion and or expression of the protein whether a glycosylation signal is recognized may profoundly determine a proteins ability to be expressed either endogenously or recombinately in another organism i.e. expressing a human protein in yeast or viral organisms or an yeast or viral protein in human etc. . Thus it may be desirable to add delete or modify a glycosylation site and possibly add a glycosylation site of one species to a protein of another species to improve the proteins functional bioprocess purification and or structural characteristics e.g. a polypeptide of the present invention .

A number of methods may be employed to identify the location of glycosylation sites within a protein. One preferred method is to run the translated protein sequence through the PROSITE computer program Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics . Once identified the sites could be systematically deleted or impaired at the level of the DNA using mutagenesis methodology known in the art and available to the skilled artisan Preferably using PCR directed mutagenesis See Maniatis Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Press Cold Spring N.Y. 1982 . Similarly glycosylation sites could be added or modified at the level of the DNA using similar methods preferably PCR methods See Maniatis supra . The results of modifying the glycosylation sites for a particular protein e.g. solubility secretion potential activity aggregation proteolytic resistance etc. could then be analyzed using methods know in the art.

The skilled artisan would acknowledge the existence of other computer algorithms capable of predicting the location of glycosylation sites within a protein. For example the Motif computer program Genetics Computer Group suite of programs provides this function as well.

Although many of the most biologically active proteins known are highly effective for their specified function in an organism they often possess characteristics that make them undesirable for transgenic therapeutic and or industrial applications. Among these traits a short physiological half life is the most prominent problem and is present either at the level of the protein or the level of the proteins mRNA. The ability to extend the half life for example would be particularly important for a proteins use in gene therapy transgenic animal production the bioprocess production and purification of the protein and use of the protein as a chemical modulator among others. Therefore there is a need to identify novel variants of isolated proteins possessing characteristics which enhance their application as a therapeutic for treating diseases of animal origin in addition to the proteins applicability to common industrial and pharmaceutical applications.

Thus one aspect of the present invention relates to the ability to enhance specific characteristics of invention through directed molecular evolution. Such an enhancement may in a non limiting example benefit the inventions utility as an essential component in a kit the inventions physical attributes such as its solubility structure or codon optimization the inventions specific biological activity including any associated enzymatic activity the proteins enzyme kinetics the proteins Ki Kcat Km Vmax Kd protein protein activity protein DNA binding activity antagonist inhibitory activity including direct or indirect interaction agonist activity including direct or indirect interaction the proteins antigenicity e.g. where it would be desirable to either increase or decrease the antigenic potential of the protein the immunogenicity of the protein the ability of the protein to form dimers trimers or multimers with either itself or other proteins the antigenic efficacy of the invention including its subsequent use a preventative treatment for disease or disease states or as an effector for targeting diseased genes. Moreover the ability to enhance specific characteristics of a protein may also be applicable to changing the characterized activity of an enzyme to an activity completely unrelated to its initially characterized activity. Other desirable enhancements of the invention would be specific to each individual protein and would thus be well known in the art and contemplated by the present invention.

For example an engineered tubulin tyrosine ligase protein may have altered specificity for its cognate receptor. In yet another example an engineered tubulin tyrosine ligase protein may be capable of being activated with less than all of the regulatory factors and or conditions typically required for tubulin tyrosine ligase protein activation e.g. phosphorylation conformational changes etc. . Such a tubulin tyrosine ligase protein would be useful in screens to identify tubulin tyrosine ligase protein modulators among other uses described herein.

Directed evolution is comprised of several steps. The first step is to establish a library of variants for the gene or protein of interest. The most important step is to then select for those variants that entail the activity you wish to identify. The design of the screen is essential since your screen should be selective enough to eliminate non useful variants but not so stringent as to eliminate all variants. The last step is then to repeat the above steps using the best variant from the previous screen. Each successive cycle can then be tailored as necessary such as increasing the stringency of the screen for example.

Over the years there have been a number of methods developed to introduce mutations into macromolecules. Some of these methods include random mutagenesis error prone PCR chemical mutagenesis site directed mutagenesis and other methods well known in the art for a comprehensive listing of current mutagenesis methods see Maniatis Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Press Cold Spring N.Y. 1982 . Typically such methods have been used for example as tools for identifying the core functional region s of a protein or the function of specific domains of a protein if a multi domain protein . However such methods have more recently been applied to the identification of macromolecule variants with specific or enhanced characteristics.

Random mutagenesis has been the most widely recognized method to date. Typically this has been carried out either through the use of error prone PCR as described in Moore J. et al Nature Biotechnology 14 458 1996 or through the application of randomized synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to specific regions of interest as described by Derbyshire K. M. et al Gene 46 145 152 1986 and Hill D E et al Methods Enzymol. 55 559 568 1987 . Both approaches have limits to the level of mutagenesis that can be obtained. However either approach enables the investigator to effectively control the rate of mutagenesis. This is particularly important considering the fact that mutations beneficial to the activity of the enzyme are fairly rare. In fact using too high a level of mutagenesis may counter or inhibit the desired benefit of a useful mutation.

While both of the aforementioned methods are effective for creating randomized pools of macromolecule variants a third method termed DNA Shuffling or sexual PCR WPC Stemmer PNAS 91 10747 1994 has recently been elucidated. DNA shuffling has also been referred to as directed molecular evolution exon shuffling directed enzyme evolution in vitro evolution and artificial evolution . Such reference terms are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention. This new preferred method apparently overcomes the limitations of the previous methods in that it not only propagates positive traits but simultaneously eliminates negative traits in the resulting progeny.

DNA shuffling accomplishes this task by combining the principal of in vitro recombination along with the method of error prone PCR. In effect you begin with a randomly digested pool of small fragments of your gene created by Dnase I digestion and then introduce said random fragments into an error prone PCR assembly reaction. During the PCR reaction the randomly sized DNA fragments not only hybridize to their cognate strand but also may hybridize to other DNA fragments corresponding to different regions of the polynucleotide of interest regions not typically accessible via hybridization of the entire polynucleotide. Moreover since the PCR assembly reaction utilizes error prone PCR reaction conditions random mutations are introduced during the DNA synthesis step of the PCR reaction for all of the fragments further diversifying the potential hybridization sites during the annealing step of the reaction.

A variety of reaction conditions could be utilized to carry out the DNA shuffling reaction. However specific reaction conditions for DNA shuffling are provided for example in PNAS 91 10747 1994 . Briefly 

Prepare the DNA substrate to be subjected to the DNA shuffling reaction. Preparation may be in the form of simply purifying the DNA from contaminating cellular material chemicals buffers oligonucleotide primers deoxynucleotides RNAs etc. and may entail the use of DNA purification kits as those provided by Qiagen Inc. or by the Promega Corp. for example.

Once the DNA substrate has been purified it would be subjected to Dnase I digestion. About 2 4 ug of the DNA substrate s would be digested with 0.0015 units of Dnase I Sigma per ul in 100 ul of 50 mM Tris HCL pH 7.4 1 mM MgCl2 for 10 20 min. at room temperature. The resulting fragments of 10 50 bp could then be purified by running them through a 2 low melting point agarose gel by electrophoresis onto DE81 ion exchange paper WHATMANN or could be purified using MICROCON concentrators Amicon of the appropriate molecular weight cutoff or could use oligonucleotide purification columns Qiagen in addition to other methods known in the art. If using DE81 ion exchange paper the 10 50 bp fragments could be eluted from said paper using 1 M NaCl followed by ethanol precipitation.

The resulting purified fragments would then be subjected to a PCR assembly reaction by re suspension in a PCR mixture containing 2 mM of each dNTP 2.2 mM MgCl2 50 mM KCl 10 mM Tris HCL pH 9.0 and 0.1 Triton X 100 at a final fragment concentration of 10 30 ng ul. No primers are added at this point. Taq DNA polymerase Promega would be used at 2.5 units per 100 ul of reaction mixture. A PCR program of 94 C for 60s 94 C for 30s 50 55 C for 30s and 72 C for 30s using 30 45 cycles followed by 72 C for 5 min using an MJ RESEARCH Cambridge Mass. PTC 150 thermocycler. After the assembly reaction is completed a 1 40 dilution of the resulting primerless product would then be introduced into a PCR mixture using the same buffer mixture used for the assembly reaction containing 0.8 um of each primer and subjecting this mixture to 15 cycles of PCR using 94 C for 30s 50 C for 30s and 72 C for 30s . The referred primers would be primers corresponding to the nucleic acid sequences of the polynucleotide s utilized in the shuffling reaction. Said primers could consist of modified nucleic acid base pairs using methods known in the art and referred to else where herein or could contain additional sequences i.e. for adding restriction sites mutating specific base pairs etc. .

The resulting shuffled assembled and amplified product can be purified using methods well known in the art e.g. Qiagen PCR purification kits and then subsequently cloned using appropriate restriction enzymes.

Although a number of variations of DNA shuffling have been published to date such variations would be obvious to the skilled artisan and are encompassed by the invention. The DNA shuffling method can also be tailored to the desired level of mutagenesis using the methods described by Zhao et al. Nucl Acid Res. 25 6 1307 1308 1997 .

As described above once the randomized pool has been created it can then be subjected to a specific screen to identify the variant possessing the desired characteristic s . Once the variant has been identified DNA corresponding to the variant could then be used as the DNA substrate for initiating another round of DNA shuffling. This cycle of shuffling selecting the optimized variant of interest and then re shuffling can be repeated until the ultimate variant is obtained. Examples of model screens applied to identify variants created using DNA shuffling technology may be found in the following publications J. C. Moore et al. J. Mol. Biol. 272 336 347 1997 F. R. Cross et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 18 2923 2931 1998 and A. Crameri. et al. Nat. Biotech. 15 436 438 1997 .

DNA shuffling has several advantages. First it makes use of beneficial mutations. When combined with screening DNA shuffling allows the discovery of the best mutational combinations and does not assume that the best combination contains all the mutations in a population. Secondly recombination occurs simultaneously with point mutagenesis. An effect of forcing DNA polymerase to synthesize full length genes from the small fragment DNA pool is a background mutagenesis rate. In combination with a stringent selection method enzymatic activity has been evolved up to 16000 fold increase over the wild type form of the enzyme. In essence the background mutagenesis yielded the genetic variability on which recombination acted to enhance the activity.

A third feature of recombination is that it can be used to remove deleterious mutations. As discussed above during the process of the randomization for every one beneficial mutation there may be at least one or more neutral or inhibitory mutations. Such mutations can be removed by including in the assembly reaction an excess of the wild type random size fragments in addition to the random size fragments of the selected mutant from the previous selection. During the next selection some of the most active variants of the polynucleotide polypeptide enzyme should have lost the inhibitory mutations.

Finally recombination enables parallel processing. This represents a significant advantage since there are likely multiple characteristics that would make a protein more desirable e.g. solubility activity etc. . Since it is increasingly difficult to screen for more than one desirable trait at a time other methods of molecular evolution tend to be inhibitory. However using recombination it would be possible to combine the randomized fragments of the best representative variants for the various traits and then select for multiple properties at once.

DNA shuffling can also be applied to the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention to decrease their immunogenicity in a specified host. For example a particular variant of the present invention may be created and isolated using DNA shuffling technology. Such a variant may have all of the desired characteristics though may be highly immunogenic in a host due to its novel intrinsic structure. Specifically the desired characteristic may cause the polypeptide to have a non native structure which could no longer be recognized as a self molecule but rather as a foreign and thus activate a host immune response directed against the novel variant. Such a limitation can be overcome for example by including a copy of the gene sequence for a xenobiotic ortholog of the native protein in with the gene sequence of the novel variant gene in one or more cycles of DNA shuffling. The molar ratio of the ortholog and novel variant DNAs could be varied accordingly. Ideally the resulting hybrid variant identified would contain at least some of the coding sequence which enabled the xenobiotic protein to evade the host immune system and additionally the coding sequence of the original novel variant that provided the desired characteristics.

Likewise the invention encompasses the application of DNA shuffling technology to the evolution of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention wherein one or more cycles of DNA shuffling include in addition to the gene template DNA oligonucleotides coding for known allelic sequences optimized codon sequences known variant sequences known polynucleotide polymorphism sequences known ortholog sequences known homologue sequences additional homologous sequences additional non homologous sequences sequences from another species and any number and combination of the above.

In addition to the described methods above there are a number of related methods that may also be applicable or desirable in certain cases. Representative among these are the methods discussed in PCT applications WO 98 31700 and WO 98 32845 which are hereby incorporated by reference. Furthermore related methods can also be applied to the polynucleotide sequences of the present invention in order to evolve invention for creating ideal variants for use in gene therapy protein engineering evolution of whole cells containing the variant or in the evolution of entire enzyme pathways containing polynucleotides of the invention as described in PCT applications WO 98 13485 WO 98 13487 WO 98 27230 WO 98 31837 and Crameri A. et al. Nat. Biotech. 15 436 438 1997 respectively.

RNA isolated from entire families or individual patients presenting with a phenotype of interest such as a disease is be isolated. cDNA is then generated from these RNA samples using protocols known in the art. See Sambrook. The cDNA is then used as a template for PCR employing primers surrounding regions of interest in SEQ ID NO 1. Suggested PCR conditions consist of 35 cycles at 95 degrees C. for 30 seconds 60 120 seconds at 52 58 degrees C. and 60 120 seconds at 70 degrees C. using buffer solutions described in Sidransky et al. Science 252 706 1991 .

PCR products are then sequenced using primers labeled at their 5 end with T4 polynucleotide kinase employing SequiTherm Polymerase. Epicentre Technologies . The intron exon borders of selected exons is also determined and genomic PCR products analyzed to confirm the results. PCR products harboring suspected mutations is then cloned and sequenced to validate the results of the direct sequencing.

PCR products are cloned into T tailed vectors as described in Holton et al. Nucleic Acids Research 19 1156 1991 and sequenced with T7 polymerase United States Biochemical . Affected individuals are identified by mutations not present in unaffected individuals.

Genomic rearrangements are also observed as a method of determining alterations in a gene corresponding to a polynucleotide. Genomic clones isolated according to the methods described herein are nick translated with digoxigenindeoxy uridine 5 triphosphate Boehringer Manheim and FISH performed as described in Johnson et al. Methods Cell Biol. 35 73 99 1991 . Hybridization with the labeled probe is carried out using a vast excess of human cot 1 DNA for specific hybridization to the corresponding genomic locus.

Chromosomes are counterstained with 4 6 diamino 2 phenylidole and propidium iodide producing a combination of C and R bands. Aligned images for precise mapping are obtained using a triple band filter set Chroma Technology Brattleboro Vt. in combination with a cooled charge coupled device camera Photometrics Tucson Ariz. and variable excitation wavelength filters. Johnson et al. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 8 75 1991 . Image collection analysis and chromosomal fractional length measurements are performed using the ISEE Graphical Program System. Inovision Corporation Durham N.C. Chromosome alterations of the genomic region hybridized by the probe are identified as insertions deletions and translocations. These alterations are used as a diagnostic marker for an associated disease.

A polypeptide of the present invention can be detected in a biological sample and if an increased or decreased level of the polypeptide is detected this polypeptide is a marker for a particular phenotype. Methods of detection are numerous and thus it is understood that one skilled in the art can modify the following assay to fit their particular needs.

For example antibody sandwich ELISAs are used to detect polypeptides in a sample preferably a biological sample. Wells of a microtiter plate are coated with specific antibodies at a final concentration of 0.2 to 10 ug ml. The antibodies are either monoclonal or polyclonal and are produced by the method described elsewhere herein. The wells are blocked so that non specific binding of the polypeptide to the well is reduced.

The coated wells are then incubated for 2 hours at RT with a sample containing the polypeptide. Preferably serial dilutions of the sample should be used to validate results. The plates are then washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded polypeptide.

Next 50 ul of specific antibody alkaline phosphatase conjugate at a concentration of 25 400 ng is added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The plates are again washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded conjugate.

Add 75 ul of 4 methylumbelliferyl phosphate MUP or p nitrophenyl phosphate NPP substrate solution to each well and incubate 1 hour at room temperature. Measure the reaction by a microtiter plate reader. Prepare a standard curve using serial dilutions of a control sample and plot polypeptide concentration on the X axis log scale and fluorescence or absorbance of the Y axis linear scale . Interpolate the concentration of the polypeptide in the sample using the standard curve.

The invention also provides methods of treatment and or prevention diseases disorders and or conditions such as for example any one or more of the diseases or disorders disclosed herein by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a Therapeutic. By therapeutic is meant a polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention including fragments and variants agonists or antagonists thereof and or antibodies thereto in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier type e.g. a sterile carrier .

The Therapeutic will be formulated and dosed in a fashion consistent with good medical practice taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient especially the side effects of treatment with the Therapeutic alone the site of delivery the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to practitioners. The effective amount for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations.

As a general proposition the total pharmaceutically effective amount of the Therapeutic administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 1 ug kg day to 10 mg kg day of patient body weight although as noted above this will be subject to therapeutic discretion. More preferably this dose is at least 0.01 mg kg day and most preferably for humans between about 0.01 and 1 mg kg day for the hormone. If given continuously the Therapeutic is typically administered at a dose rate of about 1 ug kg hour to about 50 ug kg hour either by 1 4 injections per day or by continuous subcutaneous infusions for example using a mini pump. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed. The length of treatment needed to observe changes and the interval following treatment for responses to occur appears to vary depending on the desired effect.

Therapeutics can be administered orally rectally parenterally intracistemally intravaginally intraperitoneally topically as by powders ointments gels drops or transdermal patch bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier refers to a non toxic solid semisolid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any. The term parenteral as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intrasternal subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.

In yet an additional embodiment the Therapeutics of the invention are delivered by way of a pump see Langer supra Sefton CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14 201 1987 Buchwald et al. Surgery 88 507 1980 Saudek et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 321 574 1989 .

For parenteral administration in one embodiment the Therapeutic is formulated generally by mixing it at the desired degree of purity in a unit dosage injectable form solution suspension or emulsion with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier i.e. one that is non toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. For example the formulation preferably does not include oxidizing agents and other compounds that are known to be deleterious to the Therapeutic.

Generally the formulations are prepared by contacting the Therapeutic uniformly and intimately with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. Then if necessary the product is shaped into the desired formulation. Preferably the carrier is a parenteral carrier more preferably a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water saline Ringer s solution and dextrose solution. Non aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful herein as well as liposomes.

The carrier suitably contains minor amounts of additives such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Such materials are non toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate succinate acetic acid and other organic acids or their salts antioxidants such as ascorbic acid low molecular weight less than about ten residues polypeptides e.g. polyarginine or tripeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamic acid aspartic acid or arginine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol counterions such as sodium and or nonionic surfactants such as polysorbates poloxamers or PEG.

The Therapeutic will typically be formulated in such vehicles at a concentration of about 0.1 mg ml to 100 mg ml preferably 1 10 mg ml at a pH of about 3 to 8. It will be understood that the use of certain of the foregoing excipients carriers or stabilizers will result in the formation of polypeptide salts.

Any pharmaceutical used for therapeutic administration can be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes e.g. 0.2 micron membranes . Therapeutics generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port for example an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.

Therapeutics ordinarily will be stored in unit or multi dose containers for example sealed ampoules or vials as an aqueous solution or as a lyophilized formulation for reconstitution. As an example of a lyophilized formulation 10 ml vials are filled with 5 ml of sterile filtered 1 w v aqueous Therapeutic solution and the resulting mixture is lyophilized. The infusion solution is prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized Therapeutic using bacteriostatic Water for Injection.

In a specific embodiment formulations of the present invention may further comprise antagonists of P glycoprotein also referred to as the multiresistance protein or PGP including antagonists of its encoding polynucleotides e.g. antisense oligonucleotides ribozymes zinc finger proteins etc. . P glycoprotein is well known for decreasing the efficacy of various drug administrations due to its ability to export intracellular levels of absorbed drug to the cell exterior. While this activity has been particularly pronounced in cancer cells in response to the administration of chemotherapy regimens a variety of other cell types and the administration of other drug classes have been noted e.g. T cells and anti HIV drugs . In fact certain mutations in the PGP gene significantly reduces PGP function making it less able to force drugs out of cells. People who have two versions of the mutated gene one inherited from each parent have more than four times less PGP than those with two normal versions of the gene. People may also have one normal gene and one mutated one. Certain ethnic populations have increased incidence of such PGP mutations. Among individuals from Ghana Kenya the Sudan as well as African Americans frequency of the normal gene ranged from 73 to 84 . In contrast the frequency was 34 to 59 among British whites Portuguese Southwest Asian Chinese Filipino and Saudi populations. As a result certain ethnic populations may require increased administration of PGP antagonist in the formulation of the present invention to arrive at the an efficacious dose of the therapeutic e.g. those from African descent . Conversely certain ethnic populations particularly those having increased frequency of the mutated PGP e.g. of Caucasian descent or non African descent may require less pharmaceutical compositions in the formulation due to an effective increase in efficacy of such compositions as a result of the increased effective absorption e.g. less PGP activity of said composition.

Moreover in another specific embodiment formulations of the present invention may further comprise antagonists of OATP2 also referred to as the multiresistance protein or MRP2 including antagonists of its encoding polynucleotides e.g. antisense oligonucleotides ribozymes zinc finger proteins etc. . The invention also further comprises any additional antagonists known to inhibit proteins thought to be attributable to a multidrug resistant phenotype in proliferating cells.

Preferred antagonists that formulations of the present may comprise include the potent P glycoprotein inhibitor elacridar and or LY 335979. Other P glycoprotein inhibitors known in the art are also encompassed by the present invention.

In additional embodiments the Therapeutics of the invention are administered in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic regimens such as for example radiation therapy.

The present invention relates to a method for treating an individual in need of an increased level of a polypeptide of the invention in the body comprising administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an agonist of the invention including polypeptides of the invention . Moreover it will be appreciated that conditions caused by a decrease in the standard or normal expression level of a secreted protein in an individual can be treated by administering the polypeptide of the present invention preferably in the secreted form. Thus the invention also provides a method of treatment of an individual in need of an increased level of the polypeptide comprising administering to such an individual a Therapeutic comprising an amount of the polypeptide to increase the activity level of the polypeptide in such an individual.

For example a patient with decreased levels of a polypeptide receives a daily dose 0.1 100 ug kg of the polypeptide for six consecutive days. Preferably the polypeptide is in the secreted form. The exact details of the dosing scheme based on administration and formulation are provided herein.

The present invention also relates to a method of treating an individual in need of a decreased level of a polypeptide of the invention in the body comprising administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an antagonist of the invention including polypeptides and antibodies of the invention .

In one example antisense technology is used to inhibit production of a polypeptide of the present invention. This technology is one example of a method of decreasing levels of a polypeptide preferably a secreted form due to a variety of etiologies such as cancer. For example a patient diagnosed with abnormally increased levels of a polypeptide is administered intravenously antisense polynucleotides at 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 and 3.0 mg kg day for 21 days. This treatment is repeated after a 7 day rest period if the treatment was well tolerated. The formulation of the antisense polynucleotide is provided herein.

One method of gene therapy transplants fibroblasts which are capable of expressing a polypeptide onto a patient. Generally fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in tissue culture medium and separated into small pieces. Small chunks of the tissue are placed on a wet surface of a tissue culture flask approximately ten pieces are placed in each flask. The flask is turned upside down closed tight and left at room temperature over night. After 24 hours at room temperature the flask is inverted and the chunks of tissue remain fixed to the bottom of the flask and fresh media e.g. Ham s F12 media with 10 FBS penicillin and streptomycin is added. The flasks are then incubated at 37 degree C. for approximately one week.

At this time fresh media is added and subsequently changed every several days. After an additional two weeks in culture a monolayer of fibroblasts emerge. The monolayer is trypsinized and scaled into larger flasks.

pMV 7 Kirschmeier P. T. et al. DNA 7 219 25 1988 flanked by the long terminal repeats of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus is digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The linear vector is fractionated on agarose gel and purified using glass beads.

The cDNA encoding a polypeptide of the present invention can be amplified using PCR primers which correspond to the 5 and 3 end sequences respectively as set forth in Example 13 using primers and having appropriate restriction sites and initiation stop codons if necessary. Preferably the 5 primer contains an EcoRI site and the 3 primer includes a HindIII site. Equal quantities of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus linear backbone and the amplified EcoRI and HindIII fragment are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The ligation mixture is then used to transform bacteria HB101 which are then plated onto agar containing kanamycin for the purpose of confirming that the vector has the gene of interest properly inserted.

The amphotropic pA317 or GP am12 packaging cells are grown in tissue culture to confluent density in Dulbecco s Modified Eagles Medium DMEM with 10 calf serum CS penicillin and streptomycin. The MSV vector containing the gene is then added to the media and the packaging cells transduced with the vector. The packaging cells now produce infectious viral particles containing the gene the packaging cells are now referred to as producer cells .

Fresh media is added to the transduced producer cells and subsequently the media is harvested from a 10 cm plate of confluent producer cells. The spent media containing the infectious viral particles is filtered through a MILLIPORE filter to remove detached producer cells and this media is then used to infect fibroblast cells. Media is removed from a sub confluent plate of fibroblasts and quickly replaced with the media from the producer cells. This media is removed and replaced with fresh media. If the titer of virus is high then virtually all fibroblasts will be infected and no selection is required. If the titer is very low then it is necessary to use a retroviral vector that has a selectable marker such as neo or his. Once the fibroblasts have been efficiently infected the fibroblasts are analyzed to determine whether protein is produced.

The engineered fibroblasts are then transplanted onto the host either alone or after having been grown to confluence on CYTODEX 3 microcarrier beads.

Another method of gene therapy according to the present invention involves operably associating the endogenous polynucleotide sequence of the invention with a promoter via homologous recombination as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 670 issued Jun. 24 1997 International Publication NO WO 96 29411 published Sep. 26 1996 International Publication NO WO 94 12650 published Aug. 4 1994 Koller et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 and Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 . This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells but which is not expressed in the cells or is expressed at a lower level than desired.

Polynucleotide constructs are made which contain a promoter and targeting sequences which are homologous to the 5 non coding sequence of endogenous polynucleotide sequence flanking the promoter. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5 end of the polynucleotide sequence so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination. The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5 and 3 ends. Preferably the 3 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5 end of the amplified promoter and the 5 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3 end of the amplified promoter.

The amplified promoter and the amplified targeting sequences are digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The digested promoter and digested targeting sequences are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The construct is size fractionated on an agarose gel then purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation.

In this Example the polynucleotide constructs are administered as naked polynucleotides via electroporation. However the polynucleotide constructs may also be administered with transfection facilitating agents such as liposomes viral sequences viral particles precipitating agents etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.

Once the cells are transfected homologous recombination will take place which results in the promoter being operably linked to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence. This results in the expression of polynucleotide corresponding to the polynucleotide in the cell. Expression may be detected by immunological staining or any other method known in the art.

Fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in DMEM 10 fetal calf serum. Exponentially growing or early stationary phase fibroblasts are trypsinized and rinsed from the plastic surface with nutrient medium. An aliquot of the cell suspension is removed for counting and the remaining cells are subjected to centrifugation. The supernatant is aspirated and the pellet is resuspended in 5 ml of electroporation buffer 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3 137 mM NaCl 5 mM KCl 0.7 mM NaHPO4 6 mM dextrose . The cells are recentrifuged the supernatant aspirated and the cells resuspended in electroporation buffer containing 1 mg ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. The final cell suspension contains approximately 3 106 cells ml. Electroporation should be performed immediately following resuspension.

Plasmid DNA is prepared according to standard techniques. For example to construct a plasmid for targeting to the locus corresponding to the polynucleotide of the invention plasmid pUC18 MBI Fermentas Amherst N.Y. is digested with HindIII. The CMV promoter is amplified by PCR with an XbaI site on the 5 end and a BamHI site on the 3 end. Two non coding sequences are amplified via PCR one non coding sequence fragment 1 is amplified with a HindIII site at the 5 end and an Xba site at the 3 end the other non coding sequence fragment 2 is amplified with a BamHI site at the 5 end and a HindIII site at the 3 end. The CMV promoter and the fragments 1 and 2 are digested with the appropriate enzymes CMV promoter XbaI and BamHI fragment 1 XbaI fragment 2 BamHI and ligated together. The resulting ligation product is digested with HindIII and ligated with the HindIII digested pUC18 plasmid.

Plasmid DNA is added to a sterile cuvette with a 0.4 cm electrode gap Bio Rad . The final DNA concentration is generally at least 120 g ml. 0.5 ml of the cell suspension containing approximately 1.5. 106 cells is then added to the cuvette and the cell suspension and DNA solutions are gently mixed. Electroporation is performed with a Gene Pulser apparatus Bio Rad . Capacitance and voltage are set at 960 F and 250 300 V respectively. As voltage increases cell survival decreases but the percentage of surviving cells that stably incorporate the introduced DNA into their genome increases dramatically. Given these parameters a pulse time of approximately 14 20 mSec should be observed.

Electroporated cells are maintained at room temperature for approximately 5 min and the contents of the cuvette are then gently removed with a sterile transfer pipette. The cells are added directly to 10 ml of prewarmed nutrient media DMEM with 15 calf serum in a 10 cm dish and incubated at 37 degree C. The following day the media is aspirated and replaced with 10 ml of fresh media and incubated for a further 16 24 hours.

The engineered fibroblasts are then injected into the host either alone or after having been grown to confluence on CYTODEX 3 microcarrier beads. The fibroblasts now produce the protein product. The fibroblasts can then be introduced into a patient as described above.

Another aspect of the present invention is using in vivo gene therapy methods to treat disorders diseases and conditions. The gene therapy method relates to the introduction of naked nucleic acid DNA RNA and antisense DNA or RNA sequences into an animal to increase or decrease the expression of the polypeptide. The polynucleotide of the present invention may be operatively linked to a promoter or any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the polypeptide by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques and methods are known in the art see for example WO90 11092 WO98 11779 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 693 622 5 705 151 5 580 859 Tabata et al. Cardiovasc.

The polynucleotide constructs may be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal such as injection into the interstitial space of tissues heart muscle skin lung liver intestine and the like . The polynucleotide constructs can be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.

The term naked polynucleotide DNA or RNA refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist promote or facilitate entry into the cell including viral sequences viral particles liposome formulations lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. However the polynucleotides of the present invention may also be delivered in liposome formulations such as those taught in Felgner P. L. et al. 1995 Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 772 126 139 and Abdallah B. et al. 1995 Biol. Cell 85 1 1 7 which can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.

The polynucleotide vector constructs used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of DNA. Unlike other gene therapies techniques one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.

The polynucleotide construct can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the an animal including of muscle skin brain lung liver spleen bone marrow thymus heart lymph blood bone cartilage pancreas kidney gall bladder stomach intestine testis ovary uterus rectum nervous system eye gland and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular fluid mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers collagen fibers of fibrous tissues or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent non dividing cells which are differentiated although delivery and expression may be achieved in non differentiated or less completely differentiated cells such as for example stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides.

For the naked polynucleotide injection an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 g kg body weight to about 50 mg kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg kg to about 20 mg kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg kg to about 5 mg kg. Of course as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration. The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However other parenteral routes may also be used such as inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition naked polynucleotide constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.

The dose response effects of injected polynucleotide in muscle in vivo is determined as follows. Suitable template DNA for production of mRNA coding for polypeptide of the present invention is prepared in accordance with a standard recombinant DNA methodology. The template DNA which may be either circular or linear is either used as naked DNA or complexed with liposomes. The quadriceps muscles of mice are then injected with various amounts of the template DNA.

Five to six week old female and male Balb C mice are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 0.3 ml of 2.5 Avertin. A 1.5 cm incision is made on the anterior thigh and the quadriceps muscle is directly visualized. The template DNA is injected in 0.1 ml of carrier in a 1 cc syringe through a 27 gauge needle over one minute approximately 0.5 cm from the distal insertion site of the muscle into the knee and about 0.2 cm deep. A suture is placed over the injection site for future localization and the skin is closed with stainless steel clips.

After an appropriate incubation time e.g. 7 days muscle extracts are prepared by excising the entire quadriceps. Every fifth 15 um cross section of the individual quadriceps muscles is histochemically stained for protein expression. A time course for protein expression may be done in a similar fashion except that quadriceps from different mice are harvested at different times. Persistence of DNA in muscle following injection may be determined by Southern blot analysis after preparing total cellular DNA and HIRT supernatants from injected and control mice. The results of the above experimentation in mice can be use to extrapolate proper dosages and other treatment parameters in humans and other animals using naked DNA.

The polypeptides of the invention can also be expressed in transgenic animals. Animals of any species including but not limited to mice rats rabbits hamsters guinea pigs pigs micro pigs goats sheep cows and non human primates e.g. baboons monkeys and chimpanzees may be used to generate transgenic animals. In a specific embodiment techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are used to express polypeptides of the invention in humans as part of a gene therapy protocol.

Any technique known in the art may be used to introduce the transgene i.e. polynucleotides of the invention into animals to produce the founder lines of transgenic animals. Such techniques include but are not limited to pronuclear microinjection Paterson et al. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 40 691 698 1994 Carver et al. Biotechnology NY 11 1263 1270 1993 Wright et al. Biotechnology NY 9 830 834 1991 and Hoppe et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 873 191 1989 retrovirus mediated gene transfer into germ lines Van der Putten et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 6148 6152 1985 blastocysts or embryos gene targeting in embryonic stem cells Thompson et al. Cell 56 313 321 1989 electroporation of cells or embryos Lo 1983 Mol Cell. Biol. 3 1803 1814 1983 introduction of the polynucleotides of the invention using a gene gun see e.g. Ulmer et al. Science 259 1745 1993 introducing nucleic acid constructs into embryonic pleuripotent stem cells and transferring the stem cells back into the blastocyst and sperm mediated gene transfer Lavitrano et al. Cell 57 717 723 1989 etc. For a review of such techniques see Gordon Transgenic Animals Intl. Rev. Cytol. 115 171 229 1989 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Any technique known in the art may be used to produce transgenic clones containing polynucleotides of the invention for example nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes of nuclei from cultured embryonic fetal or adult cells induced to quiescence Campell et al. Nature 380 64 66 1996 Wilmut et al. Nature 385 810 813 1997 .

The present invention provides for transgenic animals that carry the transgene in all their cells as well as animals which carry the transgene in some but not all their cells i.e. mosaic animals or chimeric. The transgene may be integrated as a single transgene or as multiple copies such as in concatamers e.g. head to head tandems or head to tail tandems. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into and activated in a particular cell type by following for example the teaching of Lasko et al. Lasko et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 6232 6236 1992 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific activation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. When it is desired that the polynucleotide transgene be integrated into the chromosomal site of the endogenous gene gene targeting is preferred. Briefly when such a technique is to be utilized vectors containing some nucleotide sequences homologous to the endogenous gene are designed for the purpose of integrating via homologous recombination with chromosomal sequences into and disrupting the function of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into a particular cell type thus inactivating the endogenous gene in only that cell type by following for example the teaching of Gu et al. Gu et al. Science 265 103 106 1994 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific inactivation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art.

Once transgenic animals have been generated the expression of the recombinant gene may be assayed utilizing standard techniques. Initial screening may be accomplished by Southern blot analysis or PCR techniques to analyze animal tissues to verify that integration of the transgene has taken place. The level of mRNA expression of the transgene in the tissues of the transgenic animals may also be assessed using techniques which include but are not limited to Northern blot analysis of tissue samples obtained from the animal in situ hybridization analysis and reverse transcriptase PCR RT PCR . Samples of transgenic gene expressing tissue may also be evaluated immunocytochemically or immunohistochemically using antibodies specific for the transgene product.

Once the founder animals are produced they may be bred inbred outbred or crossbred to produce colonies of the particular animal. Examples of such breeding strategies include but are not limited to outbreeding of founder animals with more than one integration site in order to establish separate lines inbreeding of separate lines in order to produce compound transgenics that express the transgene at higher levels because of the effects of additive expression of each transgene crossing of heterozygous transgenic animals to produce animals homozygous for a given integration site in order to both augment expression and eliminate the need for screening of animals by DNA analysis crossing of separate homozygous lines to produce compound heterozygous or homozygous lines and breeding to place the transgene on a distinct background that is appropriate for an experimental model of interest.

Transgenic animals of the invention have uses which include but are not limited to animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of polypeptides of the present invention studying diseases disorders and or conditions associated with aberrant expression and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such diseases disorders and or conditions.

Endogenous gene expression can also be reduced by inactivating or knocking out the gene and or its promoter using targeted homologous recombination. E.g. see Smithies et al. Nature 317 230 234 1985 Thomas Capecchi Cell 51 503 512 1987 Thompson et al. Cell 5 313 321 1989 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . For example a mutant non functional polynucleotide of the invention or a completely unrelated DNA sequence flanked by DNA homologous to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence either the coding regions or regulatory regions of the gene can be used with or without a selectable marker and or a negative selectable marker to transfect cells that express polypeptides of the invention in vivo. In another embodiment techniques known in the art are used to generate knockouts in cells that contain but do not express the gene of interest. Insertion of the DNA construct via targeted homologous recombination results in inactivation of the targeted gene. Such approaches are particularly suited in research and agricultural fields where modifications to embryonic stem cells can be used to generate animal offspring with an inactive targeted gene e.g. see Thomas Capecchi 1987 and Thompson 1989 supra . However this approach can be routinely adapted for use in humans provided the recombinant DNA constructs are directly administered or targeted to the required site in vivo using appropriate viral vectors that will be apparent to those of skill in the art.

In further embodiments of the invention cells that are genetically engineered to express the polypeptides of the invention or alternatively that are genetically engineered not to express the polypeptides of the invention e.g. knockouts are administered to a patient in vivo. Such cells may be obtained from the patient i.e. animal including human or an MHC compatible donor and can include but are not limited to fibroblasts bone marrow cells blood cells e.g. lymphocytes adipocytes muscle cells endothelial cells etc. The cells are genetically engineered in vitro using recombinant DNA techniques to introduce the coding sequence of polypeptides of the invention into the cells or alternatively to disrupt the coding sequence and or endogenous regulatory sequence associated with the polypeptides of the invention e.g. by transduction using viral vectors and preferably vectors that integrate the transgene into the cell genome or transfection procedures including but not limited to the use of plasmids cosmids YACs naked DNA electroporation liposomes etc. The coding sequence of the polypeptides of the invention can be placed under the control of a strong constitutive or inducible promoter or promoter enhancer to achieve expression and preferably secretion of the polypeptides of the invention. The engineered cells which express and preferably secrete the polypeptides of the invention can be introduced into the patient systemically e.g. in the circulation or intraperitoneally.

Alternatively the cells can be incorporated into a matrix and implanted in the body e.g. genetically engineered fibroblasts can be implanted as part of a skin graft genetically engineered endothelial cells can be implanted as part of a lymphatic or vascular graft. See for example Anderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 399 349 and Mulligan Wilson U.S. Pat. No. 5 460 959 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

When the cells to be administered are non autologous or non MHC compatible cells they can be administered using well known techniques which prevent the development of a host immune response against the introduced cells. For example the cells may be introduced in an encapsulated form which while allowing for an exchange of components with the immediate extracellular environment does not allow the introduced cells to be recognized by the host immune system.

Transgenic and knock out animals of the invention have uses which include but are not limited to animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of polypeptides of the present invention studying diseases disorders and or conditions associated with aberrant expression and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such diseases disorders and or conditions.

Naturally occurring V genes isolated from human PBLs are constructed into a library of antibody fragments which contain reactivities against BGS 42 to which the donor may or may not have been exposed see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 885 793 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety .

Rescue of the Library. A library of scFvs is constructed from the RNA of human PBLs as described in PCT publication WO 92 01047. To rescue phage displaying antibody fragments approximately 109 harboring the phagemid are used to inoculate 50 ml of 2 TY containing 1 glucose and 100 g ml of ampicillin 2 TY AMP GLU and grown to an O.D. of 0.8 with shaking. Five ml of this culture is used to inoculate 50 ml of 2 TY AMP GLU 2 108 TU of delta gene 3 helper M13 delta gene III see PCT publication WO 92 01047 are added and the culture incubated at 37 C. for 45 minutes without shaking and then at 37 C. for 45 minutes with shaking. The culture is centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 min. and the pellet resuspended in 2 liters of 2 TY containing 100 g ml ampicillin and 50 ug ml kanamycin and grown overnight. Phage are prepared as described in PCT publication WO 92 01047.

M13 delta gene III is prepared as follows M13 delta gene III helper phage does not encode gene III protein hence the phage mid displaying antibody fragments have a greater avidity of binding to antigen. Infectious M13 delta gene III particles are made by growing the helper phage in cells harboring a pUC19 derivative supplying the wild type gene III protein during phage morphogenesis. The culture is incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. without shaking and then for a further hour at 37 C. with shaking. Cells are spun down IEC Centra 8 400 r.p.m. for 10 min resuspended in 300 ml 2 TY broth containing 100 g ampicillin ml and 25 g kanamycin ml 2 TY AMP KAN and grown overnight shaking at 37 C. Phage particles are purified and concentrated from the culture medium by two PEG precipitations Sambrook et al. 1990 resuspended in 2 ml PBS and passed through a 0.45 m filter Minisart NML Sartorius to give a final concentration of approximately 1013 transducing units ml ampicillin resistant clones .

Panning of the Library. Immunotubes Nunc are coated overnight in PBS with 4 ml of either 100 g ml or 10 g ml of a polypeptide of the present invention. Tubes are blocked with 2 Marvel PBS for 2 hours at 37 C. and then washed 3 times in PBS. Approximately 1013 TU of phage is applied to the tube and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature tumbling on an over and under turntable and then left to stand for another 1.5 hours. Tubes are washed 10 times with PBS 0.1 Tween 20 and 10 times with PBS. Phage are eluted by adding 1 ml of 100 mM triethylamine and rotating 15 minutes on an under and over turntable after which the solution is immediately neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1.0M Tris HCl pH 7.4. Phage are then used to infect 10 ml of mid log TG1 by incubating eluted phage with bacteria for 30 minutes at 37 C. The are then plated on TYE plates containing 1 glucose and 100 g ml ampicillin. The resulting bacterial library is then rescued with delta gene 3 helper phage as described above to prepare phage for a subsequent round of selection. This process is then repeated for a total of 4 rounds of affinity purification with tube washing increased to 20 times with PBS 0.1 Tween 20 and 20 times with PBS for rounds 3 and 4.

Characterization of Binders. Eluted phage from the 3rd and 4th rounds of selection are used to infect HB 2151 and soluble scFv is produced Marks et al. 1991 from single colonies for assay. ELISAs are performed with microtitre plates coated with either 10 pg ml of the polypeptide of the present invention in 50 mM bicarbonate pH 9.6. Clones positive in ELISA are further characterized by PCR fingerprinting see e.g. PCT publication WO 92 01047 and then by sequencing. These ELISA positive clones may also be further characterized by techniques known in the art such as for example epitope mapping binding affinity receptor signal transduction ability to block or competitively inhibit antibody antigen binding and competitive agonistic or antagonistic activity.

Moreover in another preferred method the antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention may be produced in plants. Specific methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 959 177 and 6 080 560 which are hereby incorporated in their entirety herein. The methods not only describe methods of expressing antibodies but also the means of assembling foreign multimeric proteins in plants i.e. antibodies etc and the subsequent secretion of such antibodies from the plant.

VH and VL domains may be identified and cloned from cell lines expressing an antibody directed against a BGS 42 epitope by performing PCR with VH and VL specific primers on cDNA made from the antibody expressing cell lines. Briefly RNA is isolated from the cell lines and used as a template for RT PCR designed to amplify the VH and VL domains of the antibodies expressed by the EBV cell lines. Cells may be lysed using the TRIZOL reagent Life Technologies Rockville Md. and extracted with one fifth volume of chloroform. After addition of chloroform the solution is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant is collected and RNA is precipitated using an equal volume of isopropanol. Precipitated RNA is pelleted by centrifuging at 14 000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C in a tabletop centrifuge.

Following centrifugation the supernatant is discarded and washed with 75 ethanol. Following the wash step the RNA is centrifuged again at 800 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet allowed to air dry. RNA is the dissolved in DEPC water and heated to 60 C for 10 minutes. Quantities of RNA can be determined using optical density measurements. CDNA may be synthesized according to methods well known in the art and or described herein from 1.5 2. 5 micrograms of RNA using reverse transciptase and random hexamer primers. CDNA is then used as a template for PCR amplification of VH and VL domains.

Primers used to amplify VH and VL genes are shown below. Typically a PCR reaction makes use of a single 5 primer and a single 3 primer. Sometimes when the amount of available RNA template is limiting or for greater efficiency groups of 5 and or 3 primers may be used. For example sometimes all five VH 5 primers and all JH3 primers are used in a single PCR reaction. The PCR reaction is carried out in a 50 microliter volume containing 1 PCR buffer 2 mM of each dNTP 0.7 units of High Fidelity Taq polymerse 5 primer mix 3 primer mix and 7. 5 microliters of cDNA. The 5 and 3 primer mix of both VH and VL can be made by pooling together 22 pmole and 28 pmole respectively of each of the individual primers. PCR conditions are 96 C for 5 minutes followed by 25 cycles of 94 C for 1 minute 50 C for 1 minute and 72 C for 1 minute followed by an extension cycle of 72 C for 10 minutes. After the reaction has been completed sample tubes may be stored at 4 C.

PCR samples are then electrophoresed on a 1.3 agarose gel. DNA bands of the expected sizes 506 base pairs for VH domains and 344 base pairs for VL domains can be cut out of the gel and purified using methods well known in the art and or described herein.

Purified PCR products can be ligated into a PCR cloning vector TA vector from Invitrogen Inc. Carlsbad Calif. . Individual cloned PCR products can be isolated after transfection of and blue white color selection. Cloned PCR products may then be sequenced using methods commonly known in the art and or described herein.

The PCR bands containing the VH domain and the VL domains can also be used to create full length Ig expression vectors. VH and VL domains can be cloned into vectors containing the nucleotide sequences of a heavy e.g. human IgG1 or human IgG4 or light chain human kappa or human ambda constant regions such that a complete heavy or light chain molecule could be expressed from these vectors when transfected into an appropriate host cell. Further when cloned heavy and light chains are both expressed in one cell line from either one or two vectors they can assemble into a complete functional antibody molecule that is secreted into the cell culture medium. Methods using polynucleotides encoding VH and VL antibody domain to generate expression vectors that encode complete antibody molecules are well known within the art.

Generation of functional humoral immune responses requires both soluble and cognate signaling between B lineage cells and their microenvironment. Signals may impart a positive stimulus that allows a B lineage cell to continue its programmed development or a negative stimulus that instructs the cell to arrest its current developmental pathway. To date numerous stimulatory and inhibitory signals have been found to influence B cell responsiveness including IL 2 IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 7 IL10 IL 13 IL 14 and IL 15. Interestingly these signals are by themselves weak effectors but can in combination with various co stimulatory proteins induce activation proliferation differentiation homing tolerance and death among B cell populations.

One of the best studied classes of B cell co stimulatory proteins is the TNF superfamily. Within this family CD40 CD27 and CD30 along with their respective ligands CD154 CD70 and CD153 have been found to regulate a variety of immune responses. Assays which allow for the detection and or observation of the proliferation and differentiation of these B cell populations and their precursors are valuable tools in determining the effects various proteins may have on these B cell populations in terms of proliferation and differentiation. Listed below are two assays designed to allow for the detection of the differentiation proliferation or inhibition of B cell populations and their precursors.

In Vitro Assay Purified polypeptides of the invention or truncated forms thereof is assessed for its ability to induce activation proliferation differentiation or inhibition and or death in B cell populations and their precursors. The activity of the polypeptides of the invention on purified human tonsillar B cells measured qualitatively over the dose range from 0.1 to 10 000 ng mL is assessed in a standard B lymphocyte co stimulation assay in which purified tonsillar B cells are cultured in the presence of either formalin fixed Cowan I SAC or immobilized anti human IgM antibody as the priming agent. Second signals such as IL 2 and IL 15 synergize with SAC and IgM crosslinking to elicit B cell proliferation as measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation. Novel synergizing agents can be readily identified using this assay. The assay involves isolating human tonsillar B cells by magnetic bead MACS depletion of CD3 positive cells. The resulting cell population is greater than 95 B cells as assessed by expression of CD45R B220 .

Various dilutions of each sample are placed into individual wells of a 96 well plate to which are added 105 B cells suspended in culture medium RPMI 1640 containing 10 FBS 5 10 5M 2ME 100 U ml penicillin 10 ug ml streptomycin and 10 5 dilution of SAC in a total volume of 150 ul. Proliferation or inhibition is quantitated by a 20 h pulse 1 uCi well with 3H thymidine 6.7 Ci mM beginning 72 h post factor addition. The positive and negative controls are IL2 and medium respectively.

In Vivo Assay BALB c mice are injected i.p. twice per day with buffer only or 2 mg Kg of a polypeptide of the invention or truncated forms thereof. Mice receive this treatment for 4 consecutive days at which time they are sacrificed and various tissues and serum collected for analyses. Comparison of H E sections from normal spleens and spleens treated with polypeptides of the invention identify the results of the activity of the polypeptides on spleen cells such as the diffusion of peri arterial lymphatic sheaths and or significant increases in the nucleated cellularity of the red pulp regions which may indicate the activation of the differentiation and proliferation of B cell populations. Immunohistochemical studies using a B cell marker anti CD45R B220 are used to determine whether any physiological changes to splenic cells such as splenic disorganization are due to increased B cell representation within loosely defined B cell zones that infiltrate established T cell regions.

Flow cytometric analyses of the spleens from mice treated with polypeptide is used to indicate whether the polypeptide specifically increases the proportion of ThB CD45R B220 dull B cells over that which is observed in control mice.

Likewise a predicted consequence of increased mature B cell representation in vivo is a relative increase in serum Ig titers. Accordingly serum IgM and IgA levels are compared between buffer and polypeptide treated mice.

One skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of polynucleotides of the invention e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention.

A CD3 induced proliferation assay is performed on PBMCs and is measured by the uptake of 3H thymidine. The assay is performed as follows. Ninety six well plates are coated with 100 1 well of mAb to CD3 HIT3a Pharmingen or isotype matched control mAb B33.1 overnight at 4 degrees C. 1 g ml in 0.05M bicarbonate buffer pH 9.5 then washed three times with PBS. PBMC are isolated by F H gradient centrifugation from human peripheral blood and added to quadruplicate wells 5 104 well of mAb coated plates in RPMI containing 10 FCS and P S in the presence of varying concentrations of polypeptides of the invention total volume 200 ul . Relevant protein buffer and medium alone are controls. After 48 hr. culture at 37 degrees C. plates are spun for 2 min. at 1000 rpm and 100 1 of supernatant is removed and stored 20 degrees C. for measurement of IL 2 or other cytokines if effect on proliferation is observed. Wells are supplemented with 100 ul of medium containing 0.5 uCi of 3H thymidine and cultured at 37 degrees C. for 18 24 hr. Wells are harvested and incorporation of 3H thymidine used as a measure of proliferation. Anti CD3 alone is the positive control for proliferation. IL 2 100 U ml is also used as a control which enhances proliferation. Control antibody which does not induce proliferation of T cells is used as the negative controls for the effects of polypeptides of the invention.

One skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of polynucleotides of the invention e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention.

Dendritic cells are generated by the expansion of proliferating precursors found in the peripheral blood adherent PBMC or elutriated monocytic fractions are cultured for 7 10 days with GM CSF 50 ng ml and IL 4 20 ng ml . These dendritic cells have the characteristic phenotype of immature cells expression of CD1 CD80 CD86 CD40 and MHC class II antigens . Treatment with activating factors such as TNF causes a rapid change in surface phenotype increased expression of MHC class I and II costimulatory and adhesion molecules downregulation of FC RII upregulation of CD83 . These changes correlate with increased antigen presenting capacity and with functional maturation of the dendritic cells.

FACS analysis of surface antigens is performed as follows. Cells are treated 1 3 days with increasing concentrations of polypeptides of the invention or LPS positive control washed with PBS containing 1 BSA and 0.02 mM sodium azide and then incubated with 1 20 dilution of appropriate FITC or PE labeled monoclonal antibodies for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C. After an additional wash the labeled cells are analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan Becton Dickinson .

Effect on the production of cytokines. Cytokines generated by dendritic cells in particular IL 12 are important in the initiation of T cell dependent immune responses. IL 12 strongly influences the development of Th1 helper T cell immune response and induces cytotoxic T and NK cell function. An ELISA is used to measure the IL 12 release as follows. Dendritic cells 106 ml are treated with increasing concentrations of polypeptides of the invention for 24 hours. LPS 100 ng ml is added to the cell culture as positive control. Supernatants from the cell cultures are then collected and analyzed for IL 12 content using commercial ELISA kit e.g. R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. . The standard protocols provided with the kits are used.

Effect on the expression of MHC Class II costimulatory and adhesion molecules. Three major families of cell surface antigens can be identified on monocytes adhesion molecules molecules involved in antigen presentation and Fc receptor. Modulation of the expression of MHC class II antigens and other costimulatory molecules such as B7 and ICAM 1 may result in changes in the antigen presenting capacity of monocytes and ability to induce T cell activation. Increase expression of Fc receptors may correlate with improved monocyte cytotoxic activity cytokine release and phagocytosis.

FACS analysis is used to examine the surface antigens as follows. Monocytes are treated 1 5 days with increasing concentrations of polypeptides of the invention or LPS positive control washed with PBS containing 1 BSA and 0.02 mM sodium azide and then incubated with 1 20 dilution of appropriate FITC or PE labeled monoclonal antibodies for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C. After an additional wash the labeled cells are analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan Becton Dickinson .

Monocyte activation and or increased survival. Assays for molecules that activate or alternatively inactivate monocytes and or increase monocyte survival or alternatively decrease monocyte survival are known in the art and may routinely be applied to determine whether a molecule of the invention functions as an inhibitor or activator of monocytes. Polypeptides agonists or antagonists of the invention can be screened using the three assays described below. For each of these assays Peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC are purified from single donor leukopacks American Red Cross Baltimore Md. by centrifugation through a Histopaque gradient Sigma . Monocytes are isolated from PBMC by counterflow centrifugal elutriation.

Monocyte Survival Assay. Human peripheral blood monocytes progressively lose viability when cultured in absence of serum or other stimuli. Their death results from internally regulated process apoptosis . Addition to the culture of activating factors such as TNF alpha dramatically improves cell survival and prevents DNA fragmentation. Propidium iodide PI staining is used to measure apoptosis as follows. Monocytes are cultured for 48 hours in polypropylene tubes in serum free medium positive control in the presence of 100 ng ml TNF alpha negative control and in the presence of varying concentrations of the compound to be tested. Cells are suspended at a concentration of 2 106 ml in PBS containing PI at a final concentration of 5 g ml and then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before FACScan analysis. PI uptake has been demonstrated to correlate with DNA fragmentation in this experimental paradigm.

Effect on cytokine release. An important function of monocytes macrophages is their regulatory activity on other cellular populations of the immune system through the release of cytokines after stimulation. An ELISA to measure cytokine release is performed as follows. Human monocytes are incubated at a density of 5 105 cells ml with increasing concentrations of the a polypeptide of the invention and under the same conditions but in the absence of the polypeptide. For IL 12 production the cells are primed overnight with IFN 100 U ml in presence of a polypeptide of the invention. LPS 10 ng ml is then added. Conditioned media are collected after 24 h and kept frozen until use. Measurement of TNF alpha IL 10 MCP 1 and IL 8 is then performed using a commercially available ELISA kit e.g. R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. and applying the standard protocols provided with the kit.

Oxidative burst. Purified monocytes are plated in 96 w plate at 2 1 105 cell well. Increasing concentrations of polypeptides of the invention are added to the wells in a total volume of 0.2 ml culture medium RPMI 1640 10 FCS glutamine and antibiotics .

HAoSMC proliferation can be measured for example by BrdUrd incorporation. Briefly subconfluent quiescent cells grown on the 4 chamber slides are transfected with CRP or FITC labeled AT2 3LP. Then the cells are pulsed with 10 calf serum and 6 mg ml BrdUrd. After 24 h immunocytochemistry is performed by using BrdUrd Staining Kit Zymed Laboratories . In brief the cells are incubated with the biotinylated mouse anti BrdUrd antibody at 4 degrees C. for 2 h after being exposed to denaturing solution and then incubated with the streptavidin peroxidase and diaminobenzidine. After counterstaining with hematoxylin the cells are mounted for microscopic examination and the BrdUrd positive cells are counted. The BrdUrd index is calculated as a percent of the BrdUrd positive cells to the total cell number. In addition the simultaneous detection of the BrdUrd staining nucleus and the FITC uptake cytoplasm is performed for individual cells by the concomitant use of bright field illumination and dark field UV fluorescent illumination.

To demonstrate that a polypeptide of the invention accelerates the healing process the genetically diabetic mouse model of wound healing is used. The full thickness wound healing model in the db db mouse is a well characterized clinically relevant and reproducible model of impaired wound healing. Healing of the diabetic wound is dependent on formation of granulation tissue and re epithelialization rather than contraction Gartner M. H. et al. J. Surg. Res. 52 389 1992 Greenhalgh D. G. et al. Am. J. Pathol. 136 1235 1990 .

The diabetic animals have many of the characteristic features observed in Type II diabetes mellitus. Homozygous db db mice are obese in comparison to their normal heterozygous db m littermates. Mutant diabetic db db mice have a single autosomal recessive mutation on chromosome 4 db Coleman et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 283 293 1982 . Animals show polyphagia polydipsia and polyuria.

Genetically diabetic female C57BL KsJ db db mice and their non diabetic db m heterozygous littermates are used in this study Jackson Laboratories . The animals are purchased at 6 weeks of age and are 8 weeks old at the beginning of the study. Animals are individually housed and received food and water ad libitum. All manipulations are performed using aseptic techniques. The experiments are conducted according to the rules and guidelines of Bristol Myers Squibb Company s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Wounding protocol is performed according to previously reported methods Tsuboi R. and Rifkin D. B. J. Exp. Med. 172 245 251 1990 . Briefly on the day of wounding animals are anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of Avertin 0.01 mg mL 2 2 2 tribromoethanol and 2 methyl 2 butanol dissolved in deionized water. The dorsal region of the animal is shaved and the skin washed with 70 ethanol solution and iodine. The surgical area is dried with sterile gauze prior to wounding. An 8 mm full thickness wound is then created using a Keyes tissue punch. Immediately following wounding the surrounding skin is gently stretched to eliminate wound expansion. The wounds are left open for the duration of the experiment. Application of the treatment is given topically for 5 consecutive days commencing on the day of wounding. Prior to treatment wounds are gently cleansed with sterile saline and gauze sponges.

Wounds are visually examined and photographed at a fixed distance at the day of surgery and at two day intervals thereafter. Wound closure is determined by daily measurement on days 1 5 and on day 8. Wounds are measured horizontally and vertically using a calibrated Jameson caliper. Wounds are considered healed if granulation tissue is no longer visible and the wound is covered by a continuous epithelium.

A polypeptide of the invention is administered using at a range different doses from 4 mg to 500 mg per wound per day for 8 days in vehicle. Vehicle control groups received 50 mL of vehicle solution.

Animals are euthanized on day 8 with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital 300 mg kg . The wounds and surrounding skin are then harvested for histology and immunohistochemistry. Tissue specimens are placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin in tissue cassettes between biopsy sponges for further processing.

Three groups of 10 animals each 5 diabetic and 5 non diabetic controls are evaluated 1 Vehicle placebo control 2 untreated group and 3 treated group.

Wound closure is analyzed by measuring the area in the vertical and horizontal axis and obtaining the total square area of the wound. Contraction is then estimated by establishing the differences between the initial wound area day 0 and that of post treatment day 8 . The wound area on day 1 is 64 mm2 the corresponding size of the dermal punch. Calculations are made using the following formula Open area on day 8 Open area on day 1 Open area on day 1 

Specimens are fixed in 10 buffered formalin and paraffin embedded blocks are sectioned perpendicular to the wound surface 5 mm and cut using a Reichert Jung microtome. Routine hematoxylin eosin H E staining is performed on cross sections of bisected wounds. Histologic examination of the wounds are used to assess whether the healing process and the morphologic appearance of the repaired skin is altered by treatment with a polypeptide of the invention. This assessment included verification of the presence of cell accumulation inflammatory cells capillaries fibroblasts re epithelialization and epidermal maturity Greenhalgh D. G. et al. Am. J. Pathol. 136 1235 1990 . A calibrated lens micrometer is used by a blinded observer.

Tissue sections are also stained immunohistochemically with a polyclonal rabbit anti human keratin antibody using ABC Elite detection system. Human skin is used as a positive tissue control while non immune IgG is used as a negative control. Keratinocyte growth is determined by evaluating the extent of reepithelialization of the wound using a calibrated lens micrometer.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen cyclin PCNA in skin specimens is demonstrated by using anti PCNA antibody 1 50 with an ABC Elite detection system. Human colon cancer can serve as a positive tissue control and human brain tissue can be used as a negative tissue control. Each specimen includes a section with omission of the primary antibody and substitution with non immune mouse IgG. Ranking of these sections is based on the extent of proliferation on a scale of 0 8 the lower side of the scale reflecting slight proliferation to the higher side reflecting intense proliferation.

To demonstrate that a polypeptide of the invention can accelerate the healing process the effects of multiple topical applications of the polypeptide on full thickness excisional skin wounds in rats in which healing has been impaired by the systemic administration of methylprednisolone is assessed.

Young adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250 300 g Charles River Laboratories are used in this example. The animals are purchased at 8 weeks of age and are 9 weeks old at the beginning of the study. The healing response of rats is impaired by the systemic administration of methylprednisolone 17 mg kg rat intramuscularly at the time of wounding. Animals are individually housed and received food and water ad libitum. All manipulations are performed using aseptic techniques. This study would be conducted according to the rules and guidelines of Bristol Myers Squibb Corporations Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

The wounding protocol is followed according to section A above. On the day of wounding animals are anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine 50 mg kg and xylazine 5 mg kg . The dorsal region of the animal is shaved and the skin washed with 70 ethanol and iodine solutions. The surgical area is dried with sterile gauze prior to wounding. An 8 mm full thickness wound is created using a Keyes tissue punch. The wounds are left open for the duration of the experiment. Applications of the testing materials are given topically once a day for 7 consecutive days commencing on the day of wounding and subsequent to methylprednisolone administration. Prior to treatment wounds are gently cleansed with sterile saline and gauze sponges.

Wounds are visually examined and photographed at a fixed distance at the day of wounding and at the end of treatment. Wound closure is determined by daily measurement on days 1 5 and on day 8. Wounds are measured horizontally and vertically using a calibrated Jameson caliper. Wounds are considered healed if granulation tissue is no longer visible and the wound is covered by a continuous epithelium.

The polypeptide of the invention is administered using at a range different doses from 4 mg to 500 mg per wound per day for 8 days in vehicle. Vehicle control groups received 50 mL of vehicle solution.

Animals are euthanized on day 8 with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital 300 mg kg . The wounds and surrounding skin are then harvested for histology. Tissue specimens are placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin in tissue cassettes between biopsy sponges for further processing.

Four groups of 10 animals each 5 with methylprednisolone and 5 without glucocorticoid are evaluated 1 Untreated group 2 Vehicle placebo control 3 treated groups.

Wound closure is analyzed by measuring the area in the vertical and horizontal axis and obtaining the total area of the wound. Closure is then estimated by establishing the differences between the initial wound area day 0 and that of post treatment day 8 . The wound area on day 1 is 64 mm2 the corresponding size of the dermal punch. Calculations are made using the following formula Open area on day 8 Open area on day 1 Open area on day 1 

Specimens are fixed in 10 buffered formalin and paraffin embedded blocks are sectioned perpendicular to the wound surface 5 mm and cut using an Olympus microtome. Routine hematoxylin eosin H E staining is performed on cross sections of bisected wounds. Histologic examination of the wounds allows assessment of whether the healing process and the morphologic appearance of the repaired skin is improved by treatment with a polypeptide of the invention.

The recruitment of lymphocytes to areas of inflammation and angiogenesis involves specific receptor ligand interactions between cell surface adhesion molecules CAMs on lymphocytes and the vascular endothelium. The adhesion process in both normal and pathological settings follows a multi step cascade that involves intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ICAM 1 vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 VCAM 1 and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 E selectin expression on endothelial cells EC . The expression of these molecules and others on the vascular endothelium determines the efficiency with which leukocytes may adhere to the local vasculature and extravasate into the local tissue during the development of an inflammatory response. The local concentration of cytokines and tubulin tyrosine ligase protein participate in the modulation of the expression of these CAMs.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF a a potent proinflammatory cytokine is a stimulator of all three CAMs on endothelial cells and may be involved in a wide variety of inflammatory responses often resulting in a pathological outcome.

The potential of a polypeptide of the invention to mediate a suppression of TNF a induced CAM expression can be examined. A modified ELISA assay which uses ECs as a solid phase absorbent is employed to measure the amount of CAM expression on TNF a treated ECs when co stimulated with a member of the FGF family of proteins.

To perform the experiment human umbilical vein endothelial cell HUVEC cultures are obtained from pooled cord harvests and maintained in growth medium EGM 2 Clonetics San Diego Calif. supplemented with 10 FCS and 1 penicillin streptomycin in a 37 degree C. humidified incubator containing 5 CO2. HUVECs are seeded in 96 well plates at concentrations of 1 104 cells well in EGM medium at 37 degree C. for 18 24 hrs or until confluent. The monolayers are subsequently washed 3 times with a serum free solution of RPM1 1640 supplemented with 100 U ml penicillin and 100 mg ml streptomycin and treated with a given cytokine and or tubulin tyrosine ligase protein s for 24 h at 37 degree C. Following incubation the cells are then evaluated for CAM expression.

Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells HUVECs are grown in a standard 96 well plate to confluence. Growth medium is removed from the cells and replaced with 90 ul of 199 Medium 10 FBS . Samples for testing and positive or negative controls are added to the plate in triplicate in 10 ul volumes . Plates are incubated at 37 degree C. for either 5 h selectin and integrin expression or 24 h integrin expression only . Plates are aspirated to remove medium and 100 l of 0.1 paraformaldehyde PBS with Ca and Mg is added to each well. Plates are held at 4oC for 30 min.

Fixative is then removed from the wells and wells are washed 1 with PBS Ca Mg 0.5 BSA and drained. Do not allow the wells to dry. Add 10 l of diluted primary antibody to the test and control wells. Anti ICAM 1 Biotin Anti VCAM 1 Biotin and Anti E selectin Biotin are used at a concentration of 10 g ml 1 10 dilution of 0.1 mg ml stock antibody . Cells are incubated at 37oC for 30 min. in a humidified environment. Wells are washed 3 with PBS Ca Mg 0.5 BSA.

Then add 20 l of diluted ExtrAvidin Alkaline Phosphatase 1 5 000 dilution to each well and incubated at 37oC for 30 min. Wells are washed 3 with PBS Ca Mg 0.5 BSA. 1 tablet of p Nitrophenol Phosphate pNPP is dissolved in 5 ml of glycine buffer pH 10.4 . 100 l of pNPP substrate in glycine buffer is added to each test well. Standard wells in triplicate are prepared from the working dilution of the ExtrAvidin Alkaline Phosphatase in glycine buffer 1 5 000 100 10 0.5 10 1 10 1.5. 5 l of each dilution is added to triplicate wells and the resulting AP content in each well is 5.50 ng 1.74 ng 0.55 ng 0.18 ng. 100 l of pNNP reagent must then be added to each of the standard wells. The plate must be incubated at 37oC for 4 h. A volume of 50 l of 3M NaOH is added to all wells. The results are quantified on a plate reader at 405 nm. The background subtraction option is used on blank wells filled with glycine buffer only. The template is set up to indicate the concentration of AP conjugate in each standard well 5.50 ng 1.74 ng 0.55 ng 0.18 ng . Results are indicated as amount of bound AP conjugate in each sample.

In vitro site directed mutagenesis is an invaluable technique for studying protein structure function relationships and gene expression for example as well as for vector modification. Site directed mutagenesis can also be used for creating any of one or more of the mutants of the present invention particularly the conservative and or non conservative amino acid substitution mutants of the present invention. Approaches utilizing single stranded DNA ssDNA as the template have been reported e.g. T. A. Kunkel et al. 1985 82 488 492 M. A. Vandeyar et al. 198865 1 129 133 M. Sugimoto et al. 1989179 2 309 311 and J. W. Taylor et al. 198513 24 8765 8785 .

The use of PCR in site directed mutagenesis accomplishes strand separation by using a denaturing step to separate the complementary strands and to allow efficient polymerization of the PCR primers. PCR site directed mutagenesis methods thus permit site specific mutations to be incorporated in virtually any double stranded plasmid thus eliminating the need for re subcloning into M13 based bacteriophage vectors or single stranded rescue. M. P. Weiner et al. 1995 Eds. A. M. Griffin and H. G. Griffin Horizon Scientific Press Norfolk UK and C. Papworth et al. 19969 3 3 4 .

A protocol for performing site directed mutagenesis particularly employing the QUIKCHANGE site directed mutagenesis kit Stratagene La Jolla Calif. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 789 166 and 5 923 419 is provided for making point mutations to switch or substitute amino acids and to delete or insert single or multiple amino acids in the RATL1d6 amino acid sequence of this invention.

For primer design using this protocol the mutagenic oligonucleotide primers are designed individually according to the desired mutation. The following considerations should be made for designing mutagenic primers 1 Both of the mutagenic primers must contain the desired mutation and anneal to the same sequence on opposite strands of the plasmid 2 Primers should be between 25 and 45 bases in length and the melting temperature T of the primers should be greater than or equal to 78 C. The following formula is commonly used for estimating the Tof primers T 81.5 0.41 GC 675 N mismatch. For calculating T N is the primer length in bases and values for GC and mismatch are whole numbers. For calculating Tfor primers intended to introduce insertions or deletions a modified version of the above formula is employed T 81.5 0.41 GC 675 N where N does not include the bases which are being inserted or deleted 3 The desired mutation deletion or insertion should be in the middle of the primer with approximately 10 15 bases of correct sequence on both sides 4 The primers optimally should have a minimum GC content of 40 and should terminate in one or more C or G bases 5 Primers need not be 5 phosphorylated but must be purified either by fast polynucleotide liquid chromatography FPLC or by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE . Failure to purify the primers results in a significant decrease in mutation efficiency and 6 It is important that primer concentration is in excess. It is suggested to vary the amount of template while keeping the concentration of the primers constantly in excess QUIKCHANGE Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit Stratagene La Jolla Calif. .

Using the above described primer design two complimentary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation flanked by unmodified nucleic acid sequence are synthesized. The resulting oligonucleotide primers are purified.

A control reaction is prepared using 5 l 10 reaction buffer 100 mM KCl 100 mM NH SO 200 mM Tris HCl pH 8.8 20 mM MgSO 1 Triton X 100 1 mg ml nuclease free bovine serum albumin BSA 2 l 10 ng of PWHITESCRIPT 4.5 kb control plasmid 5 ng l 1.25 l 125 ng of oligonucleotide control primer 1 34 mer 100 ng l 1.25 l 125 ng of oligonucleotide control primer 2 34 mer 100 ng l 1 l of dNTP mix double distilled HO to a final volume of 50 l. Thereafter 1 l of DNA polymerase PFUTURBO DNA Polymerase Stratagene 2.5 U l is added. PFUTURBO DNA Polymerase is stated to have 6 fold higher fidelity in DNA synthesis than does Taq polymerase. To maximize temperature cycling performance use of thin walled test tubes is suggested to ensure optimum contact with the heating blocks of the temperature cycler.

The sample reaction is prepared by combining 5 l of 10 reaction buffer x l 5 50 ng of dsDNA template x l 125 ng of oligonucleotide primer 1 x l 5 50 ng of dsDNA template x l 125 ng of oligonucleotide primer 2 1 l of dNTP mix and ddHO to a final volume of 50 l. Thereafter 1 l of DNA polymerase PFUTURBO DNA Polymerase Stratagene 2.5 U l is added.

It is suggested that if the thermal cycler does not have a hot top assembly each reaction should be overlaid with approximately 30 l of mineral oil.

For the control reaction a 12 minute extension time is used and the reaction is run for 12 cycles. Segment 2 of the above cycling parameters is adjusted in accordance with the type of mutation desired. For example for point mutations 12 cycles are used for single amino acid changes 16 cycles are used and for multiple amino acid deletions or insertions 18 cycles are used. Following the temperature cycling the reaction is placed on ice for 2 minutes to cool the reaction to 

One l of the DpnI restriction enzyme 10 U l is added directly below mineral oil overlay to each amplification reaction using a small pointed pipette tip. The reaction mixture is gently and thoroughly mixed by pipetting the solution up and down several times. The reaction mixture is then centrifuged for 1 minute in a microcentrifuge. Immediately thereafter each reaction is incubated at 37 C. for 1 hour to digest the parental i.e. the non mutated supercoiled dsDNA.

Competent cells i.e. XL1 Blue supercompetent cells Stratagene are thawed gently on ice. For each control and sample reaction to be transformed 50 l of the supercompetent cells are aliquotted to a prechilled test tube Falcon 2059 polypropylene . Next 1 l of the DpnI digested DNA is transferred from the control and the sample reactions to separate aliquots of the supercompetent cells. The transformation reactions are gently swirled to mix and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. Thereafter the transformation reactions are heat pulsed for 45 seconds at 42 C. for 2 minutes.

0.5 ml of NZY broth preheated to 42 C. is added to the transformation reactions which are then incubated at 37 C. for 1 hour with shaking at 225 250 rpm. An aliquot of each transformation reaction is plated on agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic for the vector. For the mutagenesis and transformation controls cells are spread on LB ampicillin agar plates containing 80 g ml of X gal and 20 mM IPTG. Transformation plates are incubated for 16 hours at 37 C.
