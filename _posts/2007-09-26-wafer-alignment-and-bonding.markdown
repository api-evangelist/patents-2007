The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

Microsystem technology applications are often composed of two or more patterned substrates that are aligned and then bonded to each other. Wafer to wafer or two substrate bonding is used to form micromechanical structures in such applications.

Thus the wafers are aligned in an alignment tool using either image capture visible or IR alignment methods. Once aligned the wafers are held in place by a removable clamping fixture that has two more clamps that clamp the edges of the wafers to spacer members to hold the wafers a desired distance apart. That is the spacers keep the wafers face to face but separated by a few microns.

After the wafers are aligned they are locked in a clamping fixture and moved to a separate bonding machine. Once in the bonding machine a center or interior point contact is made to hold the wafers together at least at the contact point. The clamps are then removed and the spacer retracted and bonding of the wafer pair begins. However there are drawbacks in the above prior art method. That is the applying of the clamping fixture invariably allows some movement when clamping force is applied. Also particles often result from the withdrawal of the mechanical spacers a chronic problem.

Also during transfer to a bonding chamber the clamping fixture is subject to mechanical transfer forces and temperature variations which can affect the wafer alignment.

Then in the bonding chamber a vacuum is usually applied which causes turbulence and can add more particles between wafers before they are sealed together.

Accordingly there is need and market for method apparatus for preserving wafer alignment from the alignment stage to the bonding stage of such wafers while avoiding or minimizing the chance for particles to become embedded between wafers before the bonding step is complete.

There has now been discovered method and apparatus for preserving wafer alignment and bonding of such wafers while minimizing particle intrusion therebetween as further described below.

Broadly the present invention provides a method for alignment of a stack of two or more electrically conductive wafers comprising 

placing the wafers in closely spaced face to face opposition which faces have been hydrophilically treated and

deflecting one wafer into contact with the other at an interior portion thereof while holding the remainders of the wafers apart by exterior pulling means to partially bond the wafer pair.

Also provided is the step of releasing the above wafers so as to permit a contact bonding wave to spread from such interior portion to the wafer edges to adhere the wafers to each other in a full bond.

Also per the invention contact between the spaced wafers can be initiated at opposed spaced wafer edges causing a contact bonding wave to spread between the wafers to join the remaining portions thereof. However the above initial interior bonding contact method is preferred.

Further provided is the method of providing position marks on corresponding portions of the two wafers and optically checking the alignment of the marks before and after full bonding of the wafer pair.

Also provided is a 3D bonded microsystem structure of a stack of two or more patterned wafers aligned to within 

By wafer alignment as used herein is meant alignment of the mating components in a stack of two or more wafers.

Referring in more detail to the drawings in the prior art wafer to wafer patterned substrates are first aligned and later bonded to each other. Such systems use a mechanical clamping fixture which holds the alignment of wafers at e.g. 3 points on the wafers perimeter. Thus two wafers are aligned and spaced apart by spacers in the clamps as shown in .

Then the so aligned wafers are transported in the prior art from an alignment stage to a bonding stage such as bonding apparatus shown in .

Here the so clamped and aligned wafer pair are placed in the bonding apparatus between a pair of spaced chucks as indicated in except that the plunger is retracted and wafer is still spaced from wafer per and such wafer is yet undeflected and in close proximity or in contact with chuck of bonding apparatus as indicated in . Subsequently the plunger descends contacting the wafer and deflecting an interior portion thereof toward and into contact with wafer below as shown or indicated in . Upon such contact a bonding wave spreads radially outwardly from the contact point between the two wafers and at about the same time the clamped spacers and are withdrawn from between such wafers which allows the contact wave to propagate to the wafers edge. Heat and pressure are then applied to create a strong and permanent bond between the two wafers .

However misaligned wafers and entrained particles therebetween can result with the above two stage prior art method as discussed above and as indicated in .

That is two wafers with circuitry therein have been bonded together at layers and but with at least one particle captured therebetween which creates a void between such layers resulting in incomplete bonding therebetween and deformation of such layers resulting in a faulty bonded structure with impaired conductivity and performance as shown or indicated in .

A new procedure and improved apparatus is required to overcome the above prior art shortcomings. The present invention provides a way out of the above difficulty as shown or indicated in .

Thus wafers are held in vacuum contact with chucks and while maintaining e.g. a 5 10 micron separation. No physical spacers are needed for separating the two wafers thus eliminating potential particle incursions.

The wafers are then precision aligned to less than 1 offset using visible and or IR illumination. That is as shown or indicated in viewing apertures are provided in the respective vacuum chucks for IR alignment lamp is mounted under aperture and IR light detector in combination with focusing lens being mounted above aperture as shown in . The IR light detector is electrically connected to light monitor to display the light received from IR lamp .

To complete the alignment system the upper wafer is marked with crosshairs while the lower wafer is marked with crosshairs as indicated in such crosshairs being in at least partial alignment with the viewing apertures and which crosshairs are illuminated by IR lamp and protected upwardly to lens or just to the eye of the observer not shown through IR receptor and thence to monitor via conductor which displays the relative position of the crosshairs on the monitor as shown or indicated in . Thus the respective wafers and can be readily positioned in accurate alignment when the crosshairs line up as shown or indicated in before the plunger is activated to deform or press wafer toward wafer . That is the alignment of the crosshairs can be viewed at the monitor at no magnification or various magnifications such as low magnification 50 500 or high magnification 500 1000 to achieve highly precise alignment of the wafers as indicated in . Once satisfactory alignment is achieved the plunger can descend through aperture in chuck pushing an inner portion of wafer toward wafer and into contact therewith in a central or interior portion of each wafer. That is at this point in which interior contact between two wafers is made separation of the rest of the wafer pair is maintained by the vacuums applied by vacuum chucks as indicated in . Thus the wafer pair are now bonded at an interior area with no shift in wafer alignment to contend with. To this end the plunger can be round in cross section including circular oval or other round shape or a combination thereof as can its aperture per hereof.

The next step is to complete the bonding of the wafer pair. That is the vacuum holding the rest or peripheral portions of wafer separate from the rest of the wafer can be suitably reduced to permit a bonding wave to spread radially outwardly from the bonded interior portion of the pair to the wafers edges to achieve full or peelable bonding of the wafer pair.

The alignment of the above wafer pair can then be verified by the above IR optical system. Thereafter heat and or pressure can be applied to the so bonded wafer pair either in situ or after transfer to a bonding apparatus or bonder to create a stronger more permanent bond with continuing precise alignment of the wafer pair while avoiding voids and or trapped particles between the so bonded wafers.

The inventive product provided according to the method and apparatus of the invention is shown as 3D bonded microsystem structure in wherein the respective wafer layers are precisely bonded in close contact with little or no intrusive particles or voids disrupting the continuity of contact therebetween permitting excellent electrical properties of the so bonded and aligned structure made possible by the present Invention.

Recall that in prior art systems e.g. per there is much uncertainty of the alignment integrity in the transport of a wafer pair from an alignment fixture to a bonder due to the actual separation of the wafers by spacers and of the prior art. Only after the bonded wafer pair is removed from the bonder can one check the alignment between the so bonded pair. Typically there is a shift between prior alignment and final bond of the wafer pair. However the inventive method and apparatus greatly reduces the potential for such alignment shift as indicated above.

Accordingly the method and apparatus of the present invention provides safeguards against misaligned bonded wafers incursions of particles and voids between wafers to provide precise wafer structures with properly aligned circuitry and high electrical conductivity and also can greatly lower the reject rate of malformed wafer stacks.

The vacuum chucks that hold the wafers are attached to electrically controlled precision motor stages that use piezoelectric motor interferometers or other means to position the movement of the stages to within less than 

The above process is dependent upon the wafers to be aligned having hydrophilic surfaces that have been chemically pretreated e.g. with hot hydrogen peroxide sulfuric acid or an rca clean typically used in semiconductor processes.

That is two wafers with hydrophilic surfaces are attracted to each other and can form a reasonable room temperature bond i.e. a peelable bond of sufficient strength so as to maintain prior alignment while the wafer pair is transferred to a bonder for heat treatment and further bond strengthening as desired.

It should be noted that if the wafer pair are brought into initial contact and a contact wave spreads to bond the wafer pair at ambient temperature the wafers will now be bonded with no shift in alignment as confirmed by the IR optical system described above. If however the wafer pair does bond out of alignment as determined by the above IR optical tests the wafers can yet be peeled apart released and the above alignment and bonding process repeated the alignment of the realigned and re bonded pair confirmed optically and then the now accurately bonded pair can be bonded in situ or transferred to a bonder with heat and or pressure applied thereto for a more permanently bonded wafer structure.

Also as indicated previously more than two wafer layers can be stacked aligned and bonded in the manner described above to form a bonded multi wafer structure as desired per the invention.
