The present invention generally relates to data communication networks and in particular to systems and methods for performing SSL VPN session failover.

A typical computer system uses a single internet protocol IP address assigned to the computer system. Any user session or program on the computer will use the IP address of the computer for network communications on a TCP IP network. Communications over the network to and from the computer for example between a client and a server use the computer s IP address as part of the network communications of the computer. In a virtual private network environment a remote user may establish a virtual private network connection from a client to a second network such as via an SSL VPN connection from a client on a public network to a server on a private network. On the second network a second IP address is used for communications between the client and the server.

A user of the virtual private network may log in via the same computing device or roam between computing devices. For each login session a different second IP address may be used for virtual private network communications. Also for each computing device of the user a different second IP address may be used for virtual private network communications. As such the user and or computing device of the user may be associated with different IP addresses on the virtual private network at various times. In some cases the user may have multiple virtual private network sessions concurrently and thus multiple IP addresses on the private network. Identifying tracking or managing the virtual private network addresses of remote users is challenging and may be compounded in an environment with a multitude of remote virtual private network users.

One challenge with assigning IP addresses for users of a virtual private network is handling failures with devices providing the IP address. A first device such as a gateway may assign the user a first IP address for use on a private network. The first device may experience a failure. The user may need to gain access to the private network via a second device such as a second gateway. This second device may assign the user a second IP address for use on the private network. This may cause problems in communications with the private network as the client applications and or a server may expect the user to be using the first IP address.

Another challenge with failovers in a virtual private network environment is security. A gateway device providing VPN connectivity may authorize a client to access the network. The gateway may check if the client device has attributes meeting one or more conditions for accessing the network. For example the gateway may check if the client has security software installed or the appropriate operating system patch. Upon authorization a user may access the private network via the gateway such as via a SSL VPN session. At some point the gateway may fail or operation may be interrupted. The client may re establish the SSL VPN session with the network. However the attributes of the client upon which the client was authorized may have changed since establishing the session. For example security software or operating system patches on the device may have been installed or removed. This may leave the network vulnerable to these changes when re establishing sessions with previously authorized clients.

The SSL VPN session failover solution of the appliance and or client agent described herein provides an environment for handling IP address assignment and end point re authorization upon failover. The appliances may be deployed to provide a session failover environment in which a second appliance is a backup to a first appliance when a failover condition is detected such as failure in operation of the first appliance. The backup appliance takes over responsibility for SSL VPN sessions provided by the first appliance. In a failover environment the first appliance propagates SSL VPN session information including user IP address assignment and end point authorization information to the backup appliance. The backup appliance maintains this information. Upon detection of failover of the first appliance the backup appliance activates the transferred SSL VPN session and maintains the user assigned IP addresses. The backup appliance may also re authorize the client for the transferred SSL VPN session.

In one case the appliance provides techniques and policies for assigning previously assigned virtual private network addresses referred to as Intranet IP IIP addresses of a user to subsequent sessions of the user as the user logs in multiple times or roams between access points. This technique is referred to IIP stickiness as the appliance attempts to provide the same IIP address to a reconnecting VPN user. In the case of appliance failover in which a backup appliance takes over responsibility for a user s SSL VPN session the appliances provide seamless IIP address stickiness for the user as the SSL VPN session is transferred to the backup appliance. The user continues his or her SSL VPN session with the backup appliance using one of the previously assigned IIP addresses of the user.

In another case the appliance provides for end point detection and re authorization of the client upon transfer of a user s SSL VPN session from a first appliance to a backup appliance. The appliance provides techniques for performing end point detection and authorization using policy based client security strings to determine attributes of the client device. Depending on the values and evaluation of these client security strings the appliance may authorize the client to access the virtual private network in accordance with one or more policies. An authorized client may establish an SSL VPN session with the first appliance. The first appliance may experience a failover condition and the SSL VPN session is transferred to a backup appliance. Although the client was authorized by the first appliance for the SSL VPN session the backup appliance performs end point detection and re authorization client for the transferred SSL VPN session using the client security string.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a system and method of maintaining a user s intranet internet protocol address upon failover of a client s secure socket layer virtual private network SSL VPN session from a first appliance to a second appliance. A second appliance receives information from a first appliance. The information identifies one or more intranet internet protocol IIP addresses assigned to a first user for accessing a network via a first secure socket layer virtual private network SSL VPN session provided by the first appliance. The second appliance detects the first appliance is unavailable to provide the first SSL VPN session to the network The second appliance receives a request from the client operated by the first user to establish a second SSL VPN session with the network. The second appliance assigns to the client a first intranet internet protocol address previously assigned to the first user from the one or more intranet internet protocol addresses as an internet protocol address on the network.

In one embodiment the second appliance provides SSL VPN connectivity to the network in response to the detection. In another embodiment the second appliance assigns a least recently or a most recently used intranet internet protocol address of the one or more intranet internet protocol addresses as the first intranet internet protocol address. In some embodiments the second appliance assigns a least used or a most used intranet internet protocol address of the one or more intranet internet protocol addresses as the first intranet internet protocol address. In another embodiment the second appliance assigns the first intranet internet protocol address from the one or more intranet internet protocol addresses responsive to a policy of a policy engine.

In other embodiments the second appliance determines an inactive intranet internet protocol address from the plurality of intranet internet protocol addresses as the first intranet internet protocol address. In one embodiment the second appliance identifies a policy specifying a domain name suffix to append to an identifier of the user to provide a user domain name. In some embodiments the second appliance associates the user domain name with the first intranet internet protocol address.

In some embodiments the second appliance receives one or more client side attributes of the client such as via end point detection. For example the second appliance may transmit a request to the client to evaluate at least one clause of a security string. The clause may include an expression associated with a client side attribute. The second appliance may receive a result of the client s evaluation of the at least one clause. The second appliance assigns the client to an authorization group based on the one or more client side attributes.

In other aspects the present invention relates to a system and method of performing authorization of a client s secure socket layer virtual private network SSL VPN session transferred upon failover from a first appliance to a second appliance. The second appliance receives from the first appliance information identifying a security string used by the first appliance to authorize a secure socket layer virtual private network SSL VPN session established between a client and a network. The second appliance detects the first appliance is unavailable to continue the SSL VPN session. The second appliance provides the SSL VPN session for the client in response to the detection. The second appliance places the SSL VPN session on hold until the client is authorized by the second appliance. The t second appliance transmits a request to the client to evaluate at least one clause of the security string. The at least one clause includes an expression identifying a client side attribute.

In one embodiment the second appliance activates the on hold SSL VPN session upon receiving a predetermined result from evaluation of the least one clause of the security string. In another embodiment the second appliance assigns the client to an authorization group based on a result from evaluation of the at least one clause. In some embodiments the second appliance transmits the request to a collection agent on the client. The collection agent gathers information associated with the client side attribute and evaluates the at least one clause. In other embodiments the second appliance receives from the client in response to the request a result from evaluation of the at least one clause providing the client side attribute.

The client side attribute may indicate a presence on the client of any of the following a version of an operating system a service pack of the operating system a running service a running process and a file. The client side attribute may also indicate a presence on the client of any one or more of the following antivirus software personal firewall software anti spam software and internet security software.

In some embodiments the second appliance responsive to a result from evaluation of the at least one clause determines that the client lacks a desired client side attribute. In response to the determination the second appliance may maintain the SSL VPN session on hold. The second appliance may determining from a result from evaluation of the at least one clause that the client side attribute is not set to a value in accordance with a policy. The second appliance may continue to keep the SSL VPN session on hold in response to the determination.

In another embodiment the second appliance assigns the client to an authorization group providing quarantined access to the network in response to a result from evaluation of the at least one clause. The second appliance then may activate the SSL VPN session. In other embodiments the second appliance assigns the client to an authorization group responsive to an application of a policy by a policy engine to a result from evaluation of the at least one clause and then may activate the SSL VPN session.

Referring now to an embodiment of an environment for providing Intranet Internet Protocol IIP addresses to users and or clients is depicted. The IIP addressing environment provided by the appliance and or client may be used for 1 assigning based on policy temporal and or status information an IIP address to a user from a plurality of IIP addresses designated to the user for accessing a network via the appliance 2 providing an IIP address assigned to the user to an application on a client requesting resolution of the internet protocol address of the client and 3 providing a mechanism to determine the IIP address assigned to the user via a configurable user domain name associated with the user s IIP address .

In brief overview the appliance provides an IIP pool of IIP addresses A N to be assigned and or used by one or more users. The IIP pool may include a pool of free or unassigned IIP addresses i.e. a free pool a pool of IIP addresses that may be reclaimed i.e. a reclaim pool and or a pool of IIP addresses that may be assigned via transfer i.e. a transfer pool such as via the transfer of a session e.g. a SSL VPN session provided by the appliance . In some embodiments if an IIP address is not available from the IIP pool then a mapped IP MIP may be used to provide a client or a user an IIP address . For mapped IP the appliance intercepts an incoming client s IP and replaces it with a MIP address. Any servers sitting behind the appliance see a MIP instead of a the client s actual IP address in the IP header field of traffic directed to them.

A set of one or more IIP addresses A N may be designated for or associated with a user. In one embodiment the appliance via an IIP policy provides a user with an IIP address from a plurality of IIP addresses A N designated for the user. For example the IIP policy may indicate to provide the user with the most recently used IIP address of the user. The appliance includes a database or table for maintaining an association of IIP addresses to entities such as users.

In additional overview the appliance provides a mechanism for querying the IIP address assigned to and or used by the user. The appliance may be configured with a user domain name policy specifying a domain suffix to associate with an identifier of the user. For example the domain name policy may indicate to append the domain suffix mycompany.com to a user identifier such as the user id of the user when logged into the appliance or network . As a result in some embodiments the appliance associates the user domain name of . e.g. userA.mycompany.com with the IIP address assigned to the user. The appliance may store in the domain name service DNS or DNS cache the user domain name in association with the IIP address . The appliance can resolve any DNS queries or ping commands based on the user domain name by providing the associated IIP address .

In further overview the client agent provides a mechanism by which the IIP address is provided to an application. The client agent includes an interception or hooking mechanism for intercepting any application programming interface API calls of the application related to determining or resolving the internet protocol address of the client such as for example gethostbyname. Instead of providing the internet protocol address of the client identified in the network stack e.g. the IP address of the client on network the client agent provides the IIP address assigned to the user via the appliance such as the IIP address of the client or user of the client on the second network connected from the client on a first network via a SSL VPN connection of the appliance.

In more detail the appliance provides an IIP address to a user or the client of the user. In one embodiment the IIP address is the internet protocol address of the user or the client used by the user for communications on the network accessed via the appliance . For example the user may communicate on a first network via a network stack of a client that provides an internet protocol IP address for the first network such as for example 200.100.10.1. From client on the first network the user may establish a connection such as an SSL VPN connection with a second network via the appliance . The appliance provides an IIP address for the second network to the client and or user such as 192.10.1.1. Although the client has an IP address on the first network e.g. 200.100.10.1 the user and or client has an IIP address or second network IP address e.g. 192.10.1.1 for communications on the second network . In one embodiment the IIP address is the internet protocol address assigned to the client on the VPN or SSL VPN connected network . In another embodiment the appliance provides or acts as a DNS for clients communicating via the appliance . In some embodiments the appliance assigns or leases internet protocol addresses referred to as IIP addresses to client s requesting an internet protocol address such as dynamically via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP .

The appliance may provide the IIP address from an IIP pool of one or more IIP addresses A N. In some embodiments the appliance obtains a pool of internet protocol addresses on network from a server to use for the IIP pool . In one embodiment the appliance obtains an IIP address pool or portion thereof from a DNS server such as one provided via server . In another embodiment the appliance obtains an IIP address pool or portion thereof from a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service RADIUS server such as one provided via server . In yet another embodiment the appliance acts as a DNS server or provides DNS functionally for network . For example a vServer may be configured as a DNS . In these embodiments the appliance obtains or provides an IIP pool from the appliance provided DNS .

The appliance may designate assign or allocate IIP addresses for any of the following entities 1 user 2 group 3 vServer and d global. In some embodiments the IIP pool may be designated or used for assigning IIP addresses to users. In other embodiments IIP pool may include IIP addresses to be assigned to or used by services of the appliance such as vServers . In other embodiments IIP pool may include IIP addresses to be assigned to or used by global or group entities of the appliance . In one embodiment the IIP pool may comprise a single pool of IIP addresses. In another embodiment the IIP pool may comprise multiple pools or sub pools of IIP addresses. In some embodiments the IIP pool comprises a free IIP pool . In other embodiments the IIP pool comprises a reclaimed IIP pool . In yet another embodiment the IIP pool comprises a transfer IIP pool . In some embodiments the IIP pool comprises any combination of a free IIP pool a reclaimed IIP pool and or a transfer IIP pool . In one embodiment the free IIP pool comprises IP addresses which are available for usage. In some embodiments the reclaimed IIP pool comprises IP addresses which are associated with an entity such as a user group or vServer but are inactive and available for usage. In other embodiments the transfer IIP pool comprises IP addresses that are active but can be made available through a transfer login or transfer session process.

In some embodiments the appliance may list or enumerate internet protocol addresses used for IIP addresses in the IIP pool or in some embodiments any of the sub pools in an order or priority. In some embodiments the appliance enumerates or lists the IIP addresses of a pool according to the following scheme 1 user 2 group 3 vServer and d global. In one embodiment the appliance provides an IIP address from an IIP pool for assignment based on the order or priority. For example the appliance may try to obtain a free IIP address from the user associated IP free pool first. If an IIP address is not available from the user portion of the pool the appliance may then try to obtain a free IIP address from the group portion of the pool and so on via the vServer and global portions of the pool until an IIP address can be assigned. Likewise the appliance may prioritize the sub pools and in any order or combination to search for IIP addresses to assign. For example the appliance may first search the free IIP pool then the reclaimed IIP pool and then the transfer IIP pool for IIP addresses.

The appliance may comprise any type and form of database or table for associating tracking managing or maintaining the designation allocation and or assignment of IIP addresses to a 1 user 2 group 3 vServer and or d global entities from the IIP pool . In one embodiment the appliance implements an Internet Protocol Light Weight Database Table IPLWDB . In some embodiments the IPLWDB maintains entries which provide a one to one mapping of an IP address with or to an entity. In another embodiment once an entity uses or is assigned an IIP address the IPLWDB maintains the association between the entity and IIP address which may be referred to as IIP stickiness or having the IIP address stuck to an entity. In one embodiment IIP stickiness refers to the ability or effectiveness of the appliance to maintain or hold the association between the entity and the IIP address. In some embodiments IIP stickiness refers to the ability or effectiveness of the appliance to maintain the entity IIP address relationship or assignment via any changes in the system such as a user logging in and out of the appliance or changing access points. In some embodiments the IPLWDB comprises a hash table which is hashed based on any one or more of the 1 user 2 group 3 vServer and or d global entities. The IPLWDB may comprise a hash of the user and any other information associated with the user such as client or network of client .

The IPLWDB may track manage or maintain any status and temporal information related to the IIP address entity relationship. In one embodiment the IPLWDB maintains if the IIP address for the entity is currently active or inactive. For example in some embodiments the IPLWDB identifies an IIP address as active if it is currently used in an SSL VPN session via the appliance . In another embodiment the IPLWDB maintains temporal data for the IIP address use by the entity such as when first used when last used how long has been used and when most recently used. In other embodiments the IPLWDB maintains information on the type or source of usage such as in the case of user what client or network used from or for what transactions or activities were performed using the assigned IIP address.

In some embodiments the IPLWDB tracks manages and maintains multiple IIP addresses used by an entity. The IPLWDB may use one or more IIP policies for determining which IIP address of a plurality of IIP addresses to assign or provide to an entity such as a user. In one embodiment the IIP policy may specify to provide for assignment the most recently or last used IIP address of the user. In some embodiments the IIP policy may specify to provide for assignment the most used IIP address of the user. In other embodiments the IIP policy may specify to provide the least used IIP address of the user. In another embodiment the IIP policy may specify the order or priority for which to provide IP addresses of the user for example from the most recent to least recent. In yet another embodiment the IIP policy may specify which IIP pool or sub pool to use and or in which order. In some embodiments the IIP policy may specify whether or not to use a mapped IP address and under what conditions such as when an inactive IIP address of the user is not available. In other embodiments the IIP policy may specify whether or not to transfer a session or login of the user and under what conditions.

In some embodiments the appliance can be configured to bind or make the association of one or more IIP addresses to an entity such as a user. For example in some embodiments the associations in IPLWDB are updated or maintained via bind and unbind commands via the appliance . In one embodiment the following command can be issued to the appliance via a command line interface CLI or GUI 

For example if an administrator of the appliance intends to associate the IIP addresses of 10.102 4 189 10.102.4.1 and 10.102.4.2 with a user nsroot then the administrator may issue the following commands 

In one embodiment the netmask value provides a mechanism for assigning a range of IIP addresses to a user. In some embodiments the netmask value is optional and the default is 255.255.255.255. For example the following commands are equivalent 

Likewise the administrator or other user may disassociate an IIP address with an entity such as a user via an unbind command. In some embodiments the unbind command may have similar format as the bind command. In one embodiment if the IIP address is active the bind or unbind command will not be processed. In other embodiments if the IIP address is active the appliance transmits a reset RST command to all the client and server connections associated with the active session and then proceeds to make any changes associated with the issued bind or unbind command. In another embodiment the appliance updates the associated client and server connections with any updated IIP address information. In one embodiment the appliance re establishes the associated client and server connections with the changed IIP address.

In some embodiments the appliance provides a mechanism and or technique for determining the IIP address of a user. In one embodiment the appliance is configured via a user domain name policy which provides information on specifying a user domain . In one embodiment the user domain policy specifies a domain suffix to be used in forming the user domain . For example the user domain policy in some embodiments may be specified by the following command 

In one embodiment the iipdnssuffix specifies a string such as a domain name that will be appended to the user id name to form a user domain name . The user id may be the login name of the user an alias or nickname of the user or any user identification associated with the user s profile. In one embodiment the domain suffix identifies the domain name of the network or network . In other embodiments the domain suffix may comprise a domain name or host name of the appliance . In yet other embodiments the domain suffix may be any desired predetermined or custom string for identifying the user domain name .

In the case of a user having multiple IIP addresses active concurrently the user domain name policy may specify an instance identifier or any other character or symbol to differentiate between a first instance and a second instance of a VPN session of the user. For example the policy may specify to include a number after the user id such as or  . In other embodiments the policy specifies to only associate or provide a single user domain name for a user. For example in one embodiment the user domain name is associated with the first session. In other embodiments the user domain name is associated with the most recent session.

Although the user domain policy is described as providing a domain suffix to a user identifier to form the user domain name the user domain policy may specify any portion of the user domain name . For the example the user domain policy may specify the format for the user identifier or which type of user id to use such as an identified portion of the user s profile. In some embodiments by default the domain suffix may be the same domain name as the network . In another embodiment the user domain policy may specify a format for or additions or modifications to the domain name of the network in providing the user domain name .

When a user logs in and gets assigned an IIP address the appliance stores a record associating the user id name or user domain name and IIP address . In some embodiments the appliance stores the record in DNS or a DNS cache on the appliance . In another embodiment the appliance stores the record in a DNS on server . In other embodiments the appliance stores the record in the IPLWDB . The appliance can query a DNS with the user domain name and obtain the assigned IIP address . A user logged into the appliance via SSL VPN get the IIP address of another user by using DNS instead of having to remember the IP address. For example a user on client can ping the IIP address of another user. The client agent can intercept such requests and query the DNS of the appliance to determine the IIP address assigned the user domain name. In some embodiments without logging into the appliance via SSLVPN a client can query the IIP address of a user by sending a DNS query request to the DNS of the appliance .

In some embodiments the client agent provide an interception or hooking mechanism for intercepting any requests for the local IP address of the client and returning or replying with an IIP address such as the IIP address assigned to the user. In some embodiments the hooking mechanism may include any of the mechanisms of the interceptor described above in conjunction with . In other embodiments the hooking mechanism may include any type and form of hooking mechanism such as application level hook procedure or function. In one embodiment and by way of example the hooking mechanism comprises any of the Windows API calls for setting a application hooking procedure such as via the SetWindowsHookEx API call. In some embodiments the SetWindowsHookEx function installs an application defined hook procedure into a hook chain.

Depending on the operating system of the client the client agent may use the corresponding APIs of the OS to install add modify or use a hook procedure to hook or intercept messages of an application. A hook procedure may be installed to monitor the system for certain types of events which are associated either with a specific thread or with all threads in the same space as the calling thread. In one embodiment a hook such as hooking mechanism is a point in the system message handling mechanism where an application such as the client agent can install a subroutine to monitor the message traffic in the system and process certain types of messages before the messages reach the target processing function. In some embodiments the hooking mechanism may intercept or hook any of the following function calls or messages of an application gethostbyname getaddrinfo and getsockname. In other embodiments the hooking mechanism may hook any of the Windows Socket API extensions such as WSAIoctl WSALookupServiceBegin WSALookupServiceNext and WSALookupServiceEnd.

In one embodiment the client agent transmits a request to the appliance to determine the IIP address of the host name intercepted by the hooking mechanism . In some embodiments the appliance looks up the corresponding IIP address of the host name of the client in a DNS such as DNS on appliance or DNS on a server. In other embodiments the client agent uses the user domain name of the user associated with the application to ping or DNS query the IIP address . In some embodiments the client agent transmits the local IP address of the client and the appliance queries the corresponding IIP address . In one embodiment the appliance stores the name of the client in association with the user and or IIP address in the IPLWDB . In other embodiments the client agent has cached the IIP address of the user or client and thus does not need to query the appliance . For example upon establishment of a SSL VPN connection the appliance may transmit the IIP address to the client . With the hooking mechanism instead of providing the client s local IP address the client s address on the first network the client agent provides the IIP address of the client the client s or user s address on the second network .

In some embodiments the hooking mechanism of the client agent is used to return the IIP address for supporting the transparent and seamless use of online collaboration tools via SSL VPN connections. In one embodiment the application is a NetMeeting application manufactured by the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. In some embodiments any of the applications may comprise any type of hosted service or products such as GoToMeeting provided by Citrix Online Division Inc. of Santa Barbara Calif. WebEX provided by WebEx Inc. of Santa Clara Calif. or Microsoft Office LiveMeeting provided by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. With the hooking mechanism providing the IIP address assigned to the client via the SSL VPN connection the application does not need to be modified to work as designed via the SSL VPN session. The hooking mechanism provides the IIP address of the client or user if the client instead of the local IP address when making a request to get the IP address of the client .

Referring now to an embodiment of steps of a method for assigning an IIP address to a user is depicted. In one embodiment the method is practiced to provide IIP address stickiness for a user. In some embodiments an SSL VPN user may login and logout of the appliance multiple times from different computers. For example the user may roam from computing device to computing device or switch from one location to another. In some example an SSL VPN user may be on a mobile device and have the network connectivity disrupted causing the device to re establish the SSL VPN connection. With the techniques depicted by method the SSL VPN user may get assigned the same IIP address for each of those sessions. In some embodiments the appliance may be configured with policies specifying what IIP address should be assigned to a user.

In brief overview of method at step the appliance designates a plurality of IIP address A N to a user such as an SSL VPN user from a pool of IIP addresses. At step the appliance receives a request from a client operated by the user to establish a connection via the appliance to a network such as an SSL VPN connection. At step the appliance assigns to the client or the user an IIP address on network from the IIP address pool . The appliance may make the assignment based on policy temporal information or the status of any of the designated IIP addresses A N for the user. For example in one embodiment the appliance assigns the most recently used IIP address of the user to the client . At step in some embodiments the appliance determines whether to provide a mapped IP or to transfer a session. For example if an inactive IIP address is not available for assigning to the user the appliance may opt to use a MIP address at step or to request the user to transfer an active session to the current request at step .

In further detail at step the appliance may designate or allocate any set of one or more IIP addresses A N for a user. In some embodiments the appliance designates one IIP address . In other embodiments the appliance designates up to a predetermined number of multiple IIP addresses A N for the user such as 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 15 20 or 26 IIP addresses. In one embodiment the multiple IIP addresses A N comprise a continuous range of IP addresses on network for example IP addresses 200.10.1.1 to 200.20.1.10. In another embodiment the multiple IIP addresses A N comprises any set of IP addresses on network that are not subsequent to each other. In yet another embodiment the multiple IIP addresses A N are any combination of subsequent IP address ranges and single or separate IP addresses.

In one embodiment the appliance obtains a set of internet protocol addresses from a DNS for the network accessed via the appliance . For example the appliance may obtain a set of IP addresses for the intranet from a DNS server or a RADIUS server . In another example the appliance may provide or act as a DNS and allocate the IP addresses for the intranet. In some embodiments one or more IIP addresses A N may be associated or designated with a user via a bind or similar command issued at the CLI or GUI of the appliance . In other embodiments the appliance may obtain from a DNS IP addresses A N on network s that are associated with a user. In some embodiments the appliance designates a portion of the free IIP pool to the user. In other embodiments the appliance may designate or reclaim a portion of the reclaim IIP pool to the user.

At step the user via client transmits a request to the appliance to establish a connection to the network . In some embodiments the appliance identifies the user from the request. In other embodiments the appliance identifies the user from receipt of login or authentication credentials. For example in some embodiments the user submits a user id and password via a URL or web page of the appliance . In one embodiment the client agent requests to establish a tunnel connection with the appliance using any type and form of tunneling protocol. In another embodiment the client agent requests to establish a virtual private network connection via the appliance to a network . For example the client agent may establish a virtual private network connection with the appliance to connect the client on the first network to a second network . In some embodiments the client agent establishes a SSL VPN connection with the appliance . In yet another embodiment the client agent establishes a tunnel or virtual private network connection using Transport Layer Secure TLS protocol. In one embodiment the client agent requests to establish a tunnel connection using the Common Gateway Protocol CGP manufactured by Citrix Systems Inc. of Ft. Lauderdale Fla.

At step the appliance in response to receiving the request from the user or the client assigns an IIP address on the second network from the designated set of IIP addresses A N of the user. In one embodiment the appliance determines the IIP address to assign based on an IIP policy . For example in some embodiments to maintain IIP stickiness the appliance via IIP policy determines the most recently used IIP address of the user. In other embodiments to maintain IIP stickiness the appliance via information tracked by the IPLWDB determines the most used IIP address of the user from the set of IIP addresses A N. In some embodiments in the case of one or more active SSL VPN sessions the appliance determines the next most recently used or most used IIP address of the user. In yet other embodiments the appliance determines an appropriate desired or policy driven IIP address to assign the user from the designated set of user IIP addresses A N by any combination of policy status of sessions associated with the user s IIP addresses A N and temporal information of sessions associated with the user s IIP addresses A N.

In one embodiment the appliance may use any sub pool or of the IP pool to assign an IIP address to the user. In some embodiment the free IIP pool may not have an available IIP address of the user. For example all the IIP addresses of the user are marked as active or already assigned to a session. As such in these embodiments the appliance may search the reclaim IIP pool for any IIP addresses of the user assigned but available to reclaim. In still another embodiment the appliance may search the transfer IIP pool for any IIP addresses of the user. In yet other embodiments the appliance may search any designated allocations or pools for group global or vServer IIP addresses for an IP address that may be designated and assigned for the user or otherwise provided as a mapped IP address. In some embodiments the appliance searches portions of the IP pool for IIP addresses of the user in an ordered or prioritized manner such as the free IIP pool first the reclaim IIP pool second and the transfer IIP pool third. In one embodiment the search order or priority may be specified by a policy .

In many embodiments the appliance provides a previously assigned IIP address of the user from the free IIP pool or the reclaim IIP pool . In some embodiments the appliance provides the user with the most recently or last assigned IIP address to provide IIP stickiness. However at step in some embodiments the appliance determines whether to provide a mapped IP or a transfer session . In some embodiments an IIP policy specifies whether to use a mapped IP or a transfer session in cases of the appliance not finding an available IIP address of the user from the free IIP pool and or the reclaimed IIP pool . In other embodiments an IIP policy may specify to use a Mapped IP in cases of the appliance not finding an inactive IIP address in any pool or an available IIP address in the free IIP pool . In one embodiment if the IIP policy specifies to use a Mapped IP at step then at step provides a Mapped IP instead of using an assigned IIP address .

In the cases of using a Mapped IP the appliance modifies any packets to and from the client with an IIP address of the network . For example instead of assigning the user a user designated IIP address the appliance may use any available IIP address of the IIP pool such as a globally available IIP address. The appliance may modify the packets transmitted from the client to have this mapped IP when transmitted from the appliance to a server . Also in some embodiments the appliance may modify packets transmitted from the server to the client to change the Mapped IP to the IP address of the client such as the IP address of the client on the first network . In some embodiments the appliance stores in the IPLWDB the association of the mapped IP to the user and or client .

In another embodiment if the IIP policy specifies to use a transfer session at step then at step the appliance initiates a transfer of an active session of the user. In one embodiment upon receiving by the appliance a request from a first client operated by a user to establish a VPN session the appliance may create a temporary VPN session with the client. In some embodiments the appliance may refuse to accept any data received via the temporary session until a new VPN session is created from temporary session. In other embodiments the temporary VPN session may be allocated less resources by the appliance than would be allocated to a standard VPN session. In another embodiment a temporary VPN session may not be assigned an IIP address or may otherwise be prevented from receiving data. In some embodiments the appliance may identify a number of properties associated with the existing session. In one embodiment after identifying an existing session the appliance may transmit a message to the user via the previously existing session indicating the current session attempt.

In some embodiments the appliance may transmit to the client of the user a request for information corresponding to whether to terminate the previous session. In some embodiments this request may comprise a web page which accepts user input. For example the web page may comprise an enumerated list of existing sessions with input means for the user to a select one or more sessions to be terminated. In other embodiments this request may comprise a communication to a client agent which then may respond on behalf of the user. In some embodiments this request may comprise a request for information corresponding to whether to terminate one or more of a plurality of previous sessions.

In one embodiment the request may comprise information relating to any of the properties of the existing session. In some embodiments this information may be displayed to the user along with the choice of whether to terminate the existing session. For example a web page may be displayed to the user stating you have a previously existing session which was opened July 2nd at 10 30 am do you wish to close In other embodiments this information may be transmitted to a client agent which may then make a determination whether to close a previously existing session based on the properties of the previously existing session. For example a client agent executing on the client making the new session request may determine to automatically terminate a previous session in the event that no applications are currently associated with the previous session.

In some embodiments the request may also comprise a request for information relating to whether the user would like to transfer data from a previous session to a current session. For example if a user was remotely executing an application the user may wish to resume the remote execution and the previous session or sessions associated with the remote execution using the current session. After transmitting from the appliance to the client a request for information corresponding to whether to terminate the previous session the appliance may receive from the client or the user a response comprising an indication to terminate the previous session. In still other embodiments the appliance may receive a response comprising a request to transfer data associated with a previous session to the current session. In these embodiments the appliance assigns the IIP address A of the previous session to the new session.

In the event the appliance receives a response comprising an indication not to terminate the previous session the appliance may refuse to allow the user access and terminate the temporary VPN session. In these embodiments the appliance maintains the association of the IIP addresses with the previous session and does not assign the IIP address to the new session. In other embodiments the appliance may create a new VPN session unrelated to any of the identified previous sessions. In these embodiments the appliance may assign an available IIP address from another entity such as group vServer or global or another user to the new VPN session.

The secondary appliance may establish a failover session. At step a failover condition of the primary appliance is detected. At step the secondary appliance receives a request from a client to establish a second SSL VPN session for the user. At step the secondary appliance assigns to the user and or client a propagated IIP address of the user.

In further details at step an application or a user on the client may request a SSL VPN connection from a first network to a second network such as to a server on network . In one embodiment the client agent transmits a request to the appliance to establish the SSL VPN session with the server . In some embodiments the appliance establishes a first transport layer connection with the client via client . In response to the request the appliance may establish a second transport layer connection with the server . In one case the appliance provides an SSL VPN session to the client via the first transport layer connection. In some embodiments the appliance may already have an established connection with a server. For example the appliance may have one or more pooled transport layer connections to the server . In some cases the client agent transmits a configuration command e.g. cfg to request and establish a SSL VPN session.

The appliance may assign or otherwise provide the user identified with the SSL VPN session with an IIP address . The appliance may use any of the systems and methods described herein to assign the IIP address such as any of the embodiments described in conjunction with and above. The appliance may assign an IIP address to a user from a plurality of IIP addresses based on policy temporal and or status information. For example the appliance may assign to the SSL VPN session a most recently or most frequently used IIP address . The appliance such as via session manager maintains the state of the IIP addresses used or assigned to the user. For example the IIP address assigned to the user may be identified as in the active state. The appliance may also track any temporal and client information associated with the user assigned IIP address.

Further to step the appliance may associate inherit or otherwise apply one or more policies to the SSL VPN session such as via session manager . In one embodiment the appliance associates or inherits one or more policies with the SSL VPN session based on the configuration of the policy engine at the time of the request and or establishment. In another embodiments the appliance associates or inherits one or more policies with the SSL VPN session based on executed policy or policy configuration commands upon the establishment of the SSL VPN session or any time thereafter.

The appliance such as via session manager may store and maintain information on the established SSL VPN session in one or more objects data structures tables and or files. Some portions of the session information may be static. For example the session information is stored upon establishment and not changed thereafter. In some cases portions of the session information may be dynamic. For example the session manager may store and maintain counters for auditing and or to hold statistics on the session such as bytes sent received and transfer rates. In some embodiments the appliance such as via session manager stores session information in a hash table. For example a session cookie may be hashed or used as a key to obtain information on a session in a table.

At step the primary appliance propagates information on the SSL VPN session and or IIP addresses to the secondary appliance . The primary appliance may transmit or communicate via the failover connection to the secondary appliance to provide any information on the SSL VPN session IIP address used for the session and or IIP addresses of the user. The primary appliance may communicate marshal or otherwise transfer the data from the one or more objects data structures or files to store and or maintain the session and or IIP address information.

The primary appliance may propagate the SSL VPN and or IIP address information at any time upon establishment of the session or any time thereafter. In one embodiment the primary appliance propagates the SSL VPN and or IIP address information in an synchronous manner. For example upon establishment of the SSL VPN session by the primary appliance the appliance propagates the information to the secondary appliance . In one embodiment the primary appliance propagates the information to the secondary appliance after the receipt of the configuration command e.g. cfg command from the client agent requesting establishment of the SSL VPN session. In other embodiments the primary appliance propagates the SSL VPN and or IIP address information in a asynchronous manner. For example the primary appliance may propagate the information based on a timeout loop.

The primary appliance may propagate SSL VPN and or IIP address information for each session asynchronously or synchronously. In some cases the primary appliance propagates SSL VPN and or IIP address information for multiple sessions. In one embodiment the propagation of multiple sessions and or IIP address information may occur subsequently to each other. In other embodiments the propagation of multiple session and or IIP address information may transmitted concurrently via one or more connections . In one case the propagation of multiple session and or IIP address information is multiplexed over a single connection .

The primary appliance may propagate any static session and or IIP address information once upon or after establishment of the SSL VPN session and or user assigned IIP address. The primary appliance may propagate any dynamically changed session and or IIP address information upon any changes to the session or IIP address information. In another case the primary appliance may propagate any dynamically changed session and or IIP address information upon a predetermined frequency or configured events.

Upon receipt of any propagated information from the primary appliance the secondary appliance may store the propagated information in any type and form of objects data structures tables and or files. The session manager may establish the SSL VPN session on the secondary appliance . The session manager may identify the session as not active. For example the session manager may put the backup or failover session on hold. The session manager may also establish one or more IIP addresses for a user based on the propagated information. The session manager may maintain the states of the IIP addresses based on the activity of the primary or secondary appliance and session of the user. For example the session manager may identify the propagated IIP address as on hold. In another example the appliance marks or identifies all the secondary IIP addresses on hold or inactive. In one embodiment the session manager activates an SSL VPN session and or IIP address of a user based on detection of a failover condition from the failover detector.

At step the primary appliance is detected in a state or condition to cause failover. The failover detector may detect a failover condition of the primary appliance . The failover detector may monitor the state or condition of the primary appliance on a predetermined frequency.

In one embodiment the client agent informs the failover detector and or secondary appliance of the state or condition of the appliance . In another embodiment the primary appliance such as via a first failover detector informs a second failover detector and or secondary appliance of the state or condition of the appliance .

The failover condition of the primary appliance may be for one or more SSL VPN sessions or for all sessions. In one embodiment the primary appliance may be in a failover state or condition with respect to a first SSL VPN session. In another embodiment the primary appliance may remain active and or operations for a second SSL VPN session. For example a first VIP server of the primary appliance may go down while a second VIP server remains active. As such the secondary appliance may provide backup or failover to all the sessions of the primary appliance or a portion of the sessions. In other embodiments a second backup appliance may provide failover services to another portion of the sessions of the primary appliance .

Upon detection of the failover condition the secondary appliance may change a state of any of the backup or failover sessions. For example the session manger may activate one or more sessions such as a session propagated from the primary appliance . The secondary appliance may change the state of any IIP addresses. For example the session manager may activate one or more IIP addresses. In some embodiments the secondary appliance changes the state of any session and or IIP address upon request to establish a session via the secondary appliance .

The appliance may use any type and form of address resolution protocol ARP to resolve any IIP addresses. In one embodiment the appliance uses a gratuitous ARP to resolve IIP addresses used by appliances. The appliance may transmit an ARP or gratuitous ARP request on a predetermined time period or frequency. The appliance may transmit an ARP or gratuitous ARP request based on a detection event of the failover detector . In some embodiments the appliance transmit san ARP or gratuitous ARP request based any type and form of scheduling algorithm such as a staggered yield CPU algorithm. Based on the results of the ARP requests the appliance may activate one or more IIP addresses.

At step the client establishes or obtains SSL VPN session connectivity via the secondary appliance . In one embodiment the client agent detects or otherwise determines the primary appliance is not operational or otherwise no longer servicing or providing the session. The client is configured and constructed to transmit a request to the secondary appliance to establish or re establish the session. In some embodiments the client agent re establishes the connection and or session using a host name or an IP address of the primary appliance. With the failover detected the secondary appliance may listen and respond to the IP address or host name. In another embodiment the failover detector or secondary appliance informs the client agent to use the secondary appliance to continue or re establish the session with the secondary appliance . In yet another embodiment the client and or client agent continues to use the session after failover. The secondary appliance seamlessly and or transparently continues to provide or resume the session.

At step the secondary appliance assigns to the user for the SSL VPN session an IIP address assigned to the user such as the IIP address assigned during the SSL VPN session provided by the primary appliance . The appliance provides IIP stickiness for the user during the failover as the session is provided by the backup or secondary appliance . The appliance may use any of the systems and methods described in conjunction to assign or designate IIP addresses to a user or client based on the propagated IIP address information received from the primary appliance .

In some cases the secondary appliance may assign to the user or client a most recently used IIP address. In another cases the secondary appliance may assign to the user or client a least recently used IIP address. In some embodiments the secondary appliance assigns to the user or client the most used or one of the most used IIP addresses of the user or client. In some embodiments the secondary appliance determines the propagated IIP address to assign to the user or client responsive to one or more policies of a policy engine. The secondary appliance may choose an inactive IIP address and make the IIP address active for assigning to the user or client. The second appliance may responsive to a policy specify a domain name suffix to append to an identifier of the user to provide a user domain name for the IIP address.

Referring now to an embodiment of example IIP propagation scenarios during session failover are depicted. In some cases the stickiness of IIP addresses of a user may become out of sync due to SSL VPN session deletion propagation failure. For example the IIP address stickiness may not be maintained in the primary appliances but exists in the secondary appliance. The appliance includes a restoration mechanism to restore the appropriate IIP address stickiness in such situations.

In view of Example 1 of the system may include two authenticated authorized and audited users u and u. These users may be associated or bound to a group g . Group g may have one IIP address bound or associated with it. Initially the users u and u may not have an IIP address bound to the user. In following the transaction of the Example 1 diagram the user u at T may establish a SSL VPN session with the primary and be assigned the IIP address of the group. Using the techniques described herein the SSL VPN session and IIP address is propagated at T from the primary appliance to the secondary appliance. The user may logout disconnect or otherwise terminate the session in the primary appliance . The primary appliance may delete the session also at T. The propagation of the deleted session may fail at T leaving the secondary appliance having the propagated first session of the user and associated IIP address. At this point the secondary and primary appliances are out of synch with respect to the SSL VPN session and or the IIP address. At T the user logins into the primary appliance and gets the same IIP address and the session and IIP address information is propagated to the secondary appliance.

In view of the above example and in one embodiment the restorer determines the out of sync states of the session and or IIP address between the secondary and primary appliance. The restorer may deleted the earlier session propagated at T and restore the appropriate stickiness. For example the restore may delete the IIP address from the secondary appliance. In another example the restorer may change the state of the IIP address from active to inactive or some other non active state designator.

In another Example of Example 2 depicted in the user u establishes at T a session with the primary appliance and is assigned a IIP address. At T the primary appliance propagates the session and IIP address information to the secondary appliance . At T the user u may log out. The propagation from the primary appliance to secondary appliance may fail. For example the session of user u which was terminated may be deleted by the primary appliance. At T the user u may establish or re establish a session with the primary appliance and reclaim or be assigned the IIP address. The primary appliance may propagate to the secondary appliance information on this session of u and the assigned IIP address to u. In one embodiment the user u may already be assigned the IIP address via the secondary. This may create an IIP address conflict.

In view of this second example the secondary appliance and or restorer may determine if the propagated IIP address is active in the secondary appliance. If the IIP address is active then either the session of u on the primary appliance or the session of u on the secondary appliance may be deleted or otherwise deactivated. Then the appliance having the remaining session may reclaim and continue to use the IIP

Referring now to an embodiment of steps of a method for performing end point authorization or re authorization during appliance failover of an SSL VPN session is depicted. Using the techniques discussed herein the secondary appliance performs end point re authorization on the client upon failover although the client may have been authorized via the primary appliance . In view of the systems and methods described herein in conjunction with and the appliance may use client security strings to perform end point authorization. Via the values of one or more client security strings the appliance determines if the client has attributes that meet a predetermined policy for authorization. Depending on the values returned by the client via client agent the appliance determined whether or not to authorize the client to connect and establish an SSL VPN session via the appliance.

As part of the session data and information the appliance such as via session manager may store maintain or track the values of the client security strings used to perform end point detection and authorization. In some embodiments these client security string values or end point authorization values are not propagated from the primary appliance to the secondary appliance. In other embodiments any client security string values propagated to a secondary appliance may become out of sync or stale. In other cases the values for the client security strings would change if re obtained or detected from the client. For example one or more attributes or characteristics of the client may have changed between the client s establishment of the session with the appliance and the failover. The client may go through one or more software upgrades or de installs between SSL VPN session login and the occurrence of a failover. The attributes of the client may be such that the values of the client security string may not allow the client to be authorized in accordance with policy.

The embodiment of steps of method in depict a technique for end point detection and authorization to address the issue with security during failover based on possible or actual changes to client attributes that may impact client security strings applied to the transferred session. In brief overview of method at step the primary performs end point authorization using client security strings and establishes an SSL VPN session with a user. The user may be assigned an IIP address. At step the primary appliance propagates the SSL VPN session information including client security string expressions to the secondary appliance . At step a failover condition of the primary appliance is detected. At step the secondary appliance provides SSL VPN session to the client based on propagated session information. At step the secondary appliance places the transferred or failover SSL VPN session on hold until end point detection and authorization is performed on the client. At step the secondary appliance transmits the propagated client security string s to the client. The client returns values for the client security strings. The secondary appliance determines whether or not to authorized the client for access to the network or server via the SSL VPN session. At step if the client is authorized the secondary appliance activates the SSL VPN session. Otherwise the secondary appliance maintains the session on hold deactivates or otherwise deletes the session.

In further details at step an application or a user on the client may request a SSL VPN connection from a first network to a second network such as to a server on network . As discussed above in connection with step of the client agent may establish a connection with the primary appliance . The client agent may transmit a request to establish an SSL VPN session to a server or the network via the appliance . The appliance may associate inherit or otherwise apply one or more policies to the session or connection request from the client such as any type and form of end point authorization policy. In response to the request the appliance in accordance with policy may perform any type and form of end point detection and authorization. In some embodiments the appliance performs any of the end point detection and authorization techniques using client security strings described above in connection with and .

Using the client security string techniques described herein the appliance based on policy transmits a client security string for evaluation to the client agent . For example a client security string may in one embodiment be expressed in the form of 

The client agent evaluates the one or more client security strings and transmits values for the strings to the appliance . Based on the policy configuration the appliance determines whether or not the client is authorized to establish the SSL VPN session. If the client is authorized the appliance establishes and allows the SSL VPN session to be used by the client . Otherwise the appliance may deny or drop the client s request for access via an SSL VPN session.

The appliance such as via session manager may store and maintain information on the established SSL VPN session including any IIP address information in one or more objects data structures tables and or files. The appliance may store and maintain information on the client security strings applied to the established SSL VPN session and any values thereof In some embodiments the appliance tracks the client security strings used for the session via any pointing or indexing to the applicable policies of the policy engine .

At step the primary appliance propagates information on the SSL VPN session and or client security strings to the secondary appliance . The primary appliance may transmit or communicate via the failover connection to the secondary appliance to provide any information on the SSL VPN session IIP addresses associated with the session and or the client security strings applied or used for the session. The primary appliance may communicate or transfer the data from the one or more objects data structures or files to store and or maintain the session and or IIP address information.

The primary appliance may propagate the SSL VPN and or client security string information at any time upon establishment of the session or any time thereafter. In one embodiment the primary appliance propagates the SSL VPN and or client security string information in an asynchronous manner. For example upon establishment of the SSL VPN session by the primary appliance the appliance propagates the information to the secondary appliance . In one embodiment the primary appliance propagates the information to the secondary appliance after the receipt of the configuration command e.g. cfg command from the client agent requesting establishment of the SSL VPN session. In other embodiments the primary appliance propagates the SSL VPN and or client security string information in an asynchronous manner. For example the primary appliance may propagate the information based on a timeout loop.

The primary appliance may propagate SSL VPN and or IIP address information for each session asynchronously or synchronously. In some cases the primary appliance propagates SSL VPN and or client security string information for multiple sessions. In one embodiment the propagation of multiple sessions and or IIP address information may occur subsequently to each other. In other embodiments the propagation of multiple session and or client security string information may transmitted concurrently via one or more connections . In one case the propagation of multiple session and or IIP address information is multiplexed over a single connection .

The primary appliance may propagate any policies including the client security strings to the secondary appliance. The primary appliance may propagate the policies to the secondary appliance upon appliance startup policy configuration or binding of the policy to a user session or other entity. In another case the primary appliance may propagate any changed client security string information upon a predetermined frequency or configured events.

Upon receipt of any propagated information from the primary appliance the secondary appliance may store the propagated information in any type and form of objects data structures tables and or files. The session manager may establish the SSL VPN session on the secondary appliance . The session manager may identify the session as not active. For example the session manager may put the backup or failover session on hold. The session manager may also associate the propagated client string information for the session based on the propagated information. In another embodiment the secondary appliance inherits or associates the client security strings from one or more policies of the policy engine of the secondary appliance associated or bound to the session.

At step the primary appliance is detected in a state or condition to cause failover and at step the second appliance provides SSL VPN session connectivity for the client. As described in conjunction with and steps and the secondary appliance uses the propagated information to re establish an SSL VPN session for the client . For example the client agent establishes the SSL VPN session with the secondary appliance instead of the failed primary appliance. The secondary appliance claims the transferred SSL VPN session and continues the SSL VPN session for the client. In one embodiment the user requests to establish the SSL VPN session via another client.

At step the secondary appliance places or identifies the transferred propagated or established SSL VPN session as on hold or otherwise not active or available for use. The secondary appliance may determine that the session has one or more end point authorization policies or client security strings associated with the session. In one embodiment the secondary appliance determines the failed appliance propagated client security information for the session. In some embodiments the secondary appliance determines to place the session on hold responsive to a policy. In yet another embodiment the secondary appliance determines to place the session on hold based on the type of client security string. In other embodiments the secondary appliance determines to place the session on hold based on the value of the client security string detected via the primary appliance and propagated to the secondary appliance. In one embodiment the secondary appliance automatically places the SSL VPN session on hold until the client is re authorized.

At step the secondary appliance performs end point detection and authorization on the client for the transferred SSL VPN session. In one embodiment the secondary appliance transmits the propagated client security string s to the client agent for evaluation. In some embodiment the secondary appliance transmits to the client agent one client security string from a plurality of propagated client security strings. In some cases the secondary appliance determines which of the propagated client security strings to obtain updated values or to verify the values from the client upon failover. In one case the secondary appliance may determine that is not required or desired to check the value of a client security string after failover. For example the secondary appliance may determine the value of the client security string may not have changed or is not likely to have changes.

In another embodiment the secondary appliance transmits the client security string from any inherited policies or polices bound to the user or session. In some embodiments the secondary appliance transmits additional client security string in conjunction with the propagated client security strings. In one embodiment the secondary appliance modifies one or more propagated client security strings or any portions thereof by policy or otherwise. In one embodiment the secondary appliance combines the propagated client security strings with one or more client security strings imposed on the session by the secondary appliance via policy or otherwise.

Further to step the secondary appliance receives from the client agent an evaluation of the one or more transmitted client security strings. The secondary appliance checks validates or otherwise compares these values to acceptable values indicated by one or more policies of the policy engine. The comparison to values specified via policy determines whether or not the client is authorized for access. The values of the client attributes determined via evaluation of the client security string may or may not be acceptable in accordance with policy. In another embodiment the result of evaluation of the client security string or series of client security strings determines whether or not the client is authorized for access. In some embodiments the secondary appliance performs evaluation of at least a portion of the expression of a plurality of client security strings to determine authorization of the client.

At step the secondary appliance determines to activate or not activate the transferred SSL VPN session based on the results of end point detection and authorization of the client. If after appliance failover the client is re authorized in accordance with policy such as via client security strings the secondary appliance activates the SSL VPN session put on hold. In one embodiment the session manager responsive to the policy engine and end point authorization changes the state of the SSL VPN session to active. In another embodiment the secondary appliance re authenticates the user in addition to authorizing the client. The secondary appliance may activate the SSL VPN session based on re authentication of the user and re authorization of the client.

If after appliance failover the client is not re authorized in accordance with policy such as failing to provide acceptable values for the client security strings the secondary appliance does not activate the SSL VPN session placed on hold. In one embodiment the secondary appliance such as via session manager maintains the SSL VPN session on hold. In another embodiment the secondary appliance such as via session manager changes the state of the SSL VPN session to invalid inactive or not authorized. In some embodiments the secondary appliance such as via session manager deletes the SSL VPN session. In another embodiment the secondary appliance de establishes the SSL VPN session. In one embodiment the secondary appliance drops or disconnects the connection with the client responsive to the client failing end point authorization. In some embodiments the secondary appliance activates the session but limits the user s access based on the results of the end point detection such as by placing the user in a quarantined access group.

In view of the structure functions and operations during failover as described in the appliance may perform any of the steps of method and method in any combination. As such in some embodiments the appliance may provide both IIP address stickiness for users during failover as well as end point re authorization. In this manner the systems and method of the appliance described herein provide a seamless and or transparent failover solution that provides continued and or additional security measures.
