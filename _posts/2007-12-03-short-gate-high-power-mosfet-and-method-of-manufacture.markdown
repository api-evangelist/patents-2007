The present invention was developed with Government support under contract number FA8650 04 2 2410 awarded by the U.S. Air Force. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to a short gate high power MOSFET and a method of making a short gate high power UMOSFET.

In silicon carbide SiC MOSFETs metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor inversion channel mobility is dramatically lower than in silicon based MOSFETs. The relatively poor inversion channel mobility is due in large part to the gate oxidation process whereby a rough interface between the gate oxide and the underlying silicon carbide is formed. Defects which occur at the gate oxide silicon carbide interface due to the rough interface reduce channel mobility.

A common approach to improving inversion channel mobility of silicon carbide MOSFETs focuses on reducing channel length so that the distance traveled by carriers within the inversion channel underneath the gate is as short as possible. However a problem encountered with this approach is that as channel length is reduced breakdown voltage of the MOSFET device becomes limited. If the channel length is too short the channel may open responsive to a high voltage applied to the drain even without a necessary voltage applied to the gate to thus force the device into an on state when it should be off. This is commonly referred to as a short channel effect or an early turn on effect. A need thus exists to protect the channel of the device from excessive drain voltage so as to prevent short channel effects such as the early turn on effect. Key aspects of short channel MOSFET design thus include limiting the impact of low channel mobility by reducing the length of the conduction path at the MOS interface while at the same time preventing short channel effects.

The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather the embodiments as described are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the concept of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings the shape and thickness of the elements and layers may be exaggerated for clarity and are not necessarily drawn to scale. Also like reference numbers are used to refer to like elements throughout the application. Description of well known methods and materials are omitted. Also this application may include aspects or features described in copending application Ser. No. 11 855 595 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

As shown in substrate includes a first main or upper surface and a second main or bottom surface opposing first main surface . First and second main surfaces and may be characterized as front and back sides of substrate whereby devices are disposed on or over first main surface . In this embodiment as described substrate is silicon carbide SiC having n type conductivity and a thickness of about 300 to 500 m or about 400 m. More particularly although not shown in detail substrate includes an uppermost epilayer having a thickness in a range of about 5 m 30 m and a dopant concentration of at least about 10 cm. The epilayer is disposed on a base substrate having a standard thickness of at least 350 m and a high dopant concentration of at least about 10 cm. Substrate may be doped with an n type impurity such as nitrogen or phosphorous. Substrate however should not necessarily be limited as silicon carbide or as having n type conductivity but may be other materials such as silicon or gallium nitride GaN . Moreover as noted above substrate should not necessarily be limited as a single epitaxial layer on a single base substrate layer of silicon carbide or other substrate material but may in general be a growth substrate with plural epitaxial layers grown thereon.

As further shown in p type region is shown as extending from upper surface of substrate into substrate . Region may have a thickness or depth in the vertical or y direction or about 0.4 m and may be doped with a p type impurity such as aluminum boron or beryllium. Region may have a dopant profile that is graded in a vertical or y direction as having a dopant concentration of at least about 10 cmnear upper surface and a somewhat lower dopant concentration of at least about 10 cmnear the bottom of region . As should be understood in view of region extends along the z direction. Incidentally it should be understood that grading of the dopant concentration enables shaping of the depletion profile which can help limit the depletion of channel regions between neighboring regions to thus optimize resistance. However region should not necessarily be limited as having a dopant profile that is graded in the vertical direction but may have a substantially uniform dopant concentration.

As further shown in n type silicon carbide layer is disposed on an entirety of upper surface of substrate and also covering upper surface of region . Layer may be epitaxially grown and may have a total thickness of at least about 0.7 m. More particularly although not shown in detail layer may consist of multilayers to have a dopant profile that is graded in the vertical or y direction. For example layer may include a first sublayer having a dopant concentration of about 10 cmand a thickness of about 0.2 m on substrate and region and a second sublayer having a dopant concentration of about 10 cmand a thickness of about 0.5 m on the first sublayer. However layer should not necessarily be limited as merely having two sublayers as described but may in general be a single growth layer of substantially uniform dopant concentration or may consist of more than two sublayers. The doping concentration and profile of layer will determine the threshold characteristics of the device. A too high concentration or a too thick layer will result in a device with normally on characteristics.

Layer in includes a first trench in an upper portion thereof over region extending from upper surface of layer whereby trench bottom of first trench is within layer . Portion of layer is intermediate or between trench bottom of first trench and upper surface of region . First trench includes trench corner . A narrow second trench extends from trench bottom of first trench through intermediate portion of layer and exposes upper surface of region . Second trench is in a substantially central region of trench . Layer further includes n type source contact area disposed within intermediate portion as extending from trench bottom of first trench to upper surface of region and as immediately surrounding second trench . Source contact area may have a dopant concentration of at least about 10 cm. Although not particularly shown in the plan view of first and second trenches and and source contact area extend along the z direction.

The structure shown in also includes a pair of gate sections disposed over trench bottom at peripheral areas of first trench as covering respective sidewalls of first trench . In this embodiment gate sections are polysilicon having a thickness in the vertical or y direction of about 0.5 m and may be doped with boron or aluminum. Gate oxide having a thickness in a range of about 50 100 nm is disposed as on an entirety of upper surface of layer the sidewalls of first trench and portions of trench bottom of first trench . Gate oxide is intermediate between gate sections and layer . It should be understood that gate sections are disposed as having minimal overlap with source contact area .

As further shown in field dielectric such as silicon nitride is disposed over the entirety of the substrate particularly as over gate oxide and gate sections . Field dielectric may have a thickness in the vertical or y direction of about 1 m. Source contact having a thickness of about 1 m is disposed over the entirety of upper surface of field dielectric and includes extension that extends through via within field dielectric to be in contact with upper surface of source contact area and through second trench to be in contact with upper surface of region . Source contact may be a multilayer including a nickel or titanium layer stacked on an aluminum layer. In the alternative source contact may be a single layer of titanium aluminum or other materials or a multilayer having more than two layers. The structure also includes drain contact on lower or second surface of substrate . Drain contact may also be a multilayer including a nickel or titanium layer stacked on an aluminum layer but may in the alternative be a single layer of nickel titanium or other materials or a multilayer having more than two layers. Also field dielectric may be other materials such as silicon dioxide instead of silicon nitride.

As shown in the plan view of gate includes gate sections which extend along the z direction shown in . Extension of source contact extends downward in the vertical or y direction between gate sections to be in contact with first contact area and region . That is main gate contact includes multiple gate sections which may hereinafter be referred to as gate contact fingers and main source contact includes multiple source contact extensions which may hereinafter be referred to as source contact fingers . Gate contact fingers and source contact fingers extend substantially parallel with respect to each other along the z direction. As noted previously first and second trenches and not shown in also extend along the z direction substantially along the entire length of gate contact fingers and source contact fingers . Multiple regions are shown by dotted lines in and are disposed respectively under a pair of gate contact fingers and a corresponding source contact finger . As may be appreciated in view of each region extends widthwise underneath a corresponding first trench not shown along the horizontal or x direction substantially beyond the corresponding gate contact fingers and the corresponding corners of the first trench . Regions are disposed in a grid like manner and also extend lengthwise in the z direction under the first and second trenches and . The semiconductor device as shown in may thus be disposed as part of a multi cell MOSFET design.

It should be understood that even though only three corresponding sets of gate contact fingers and source contact finger with corresponding regions are shown in the number of respective sets of gate contact fingers and source contact finger should not be limited as shown in . Such a grid MOSFET device may include various multiple contact fingers and regions within the spirit and scope of the invention. Also it should be understood that the shape of main gate contact the shape of regions and the distances between source contact fingers and gate contact fingers may be exaggerated for clarity. Also for the sake of clarity gate oxide and field dielectric are not shown in .

Operation of the semiconductor device of this embodiment will now be described hereinafter with reference to . As described previously to reduce the impact of poor channel mobility the device is designed to have a very short gate length in the horizontal or x direction particularly in a range of about 0.3 m to 1.5 m. However in order to realize such a short channel region the gate must be protected from high electric fields that result from high drain voltages. In this embodiment the device is protected from such high electric fields by region .

In detail upon application of a positive potential to gate sections shown in through gate contact an inversion layer is formed in intermediate portion which may hereinafter be referred to as a channel under gate sections . The inversion layer within channel carries current from source contact area as applied from source contact substantially in the horizontal or x direction over region . The current subsequently flows in the vertical or y direction through substrate out drain contact . The device operates as a vertical MOSFET. The inversion layer is generated at both lateral sides of second trench within channel so that current flows from source contact through layer along both the left and right sides of second trench . During such a normal on state as described there is minimal potential drop within the device and the associated electric field is minimal.

To turn off the device of a ground or negative potential is applied to gate sections the value of which depends on the threshold of the device. As a result carriers electrons are not attracted to the interface between channel and gate oxide under gate sections . The inversion layer within channel thus no longer exists and vertical flow of current across channel thus stops.

In a conventional MOSFET structure of trench design that does not include a buried region such as region as shown in of the present application immediately after the device is turned off by application of ground or negative potential to the gate a large potential is present at the drain contact and a relatively low or zero potential is present at the source contact. Under such conditions a high electric field is concentrated at the corners of the trench of the conventional MOSFET. The high electric field stresses the gate oxide within the trench resulting in the occurrence of short channel effects and or device failure.

In the semiconductor device of the embodiment in of the present application region limits the electric field that penetrates to corner of trench . In greater detail at trench corner of first trench the MOSFET transitions from an on state with steady flow of electrons and very little potential difference across the device vertically to an off state where suddenly the supply of electrons across channel has been turned off. When the MOSFET is turned off the supply of electrons is removed. The depletion region begins to extend along intermediate portion with an associated potential drop across this corresponding region. As the depletion region extends laterally in the horizontal or x direction the potential drop increases such that in the off state the full applied potential is dropped across the device. However region in the device of separates gate sections from the highest electric field. The majority of the potential drop is taken up between region and drain contact . If region was not present there would be a large potential drop between gate sections and drain contact . This would result in a high electric field at corner of first trench . However because region is present in the structure shown in and is tied to a low potential at source contact a large potential drop does not exist between gate sections and upper surface of region and thus the electric field present at trench corner is relatively low. There is a larger potential drop between the bottom of region and drain contact resulting in a relatively larger electric field therebetween. However this relatively larger electric field is shielded from trench corner by region . Region can thus be characterized as splitting the potential realized across the structure.

A method of making a semiconductor device as shown in will now be described with respect to . It should be understood that this description will be presented with reference to cross sections of the device taken along section line in . Moreover this description follows wherein the semiconductor layers are silicon carbide substrate and layer have n type conductivity and region has p type conductivity. However one of ordinary skill should understand that the semiconductor layers may be other materials such as silicon noted previously for example and that conductivity type may be reversed. The description that follows thus should not be construed as limiting.

With reference to although not shown in detail and as described previously silicon carbide substrate is provided as including an epilayer on a base substrate The epilayer has a thickness in a range of about 5 m 30 m with a dopant concentration in a range of at least about 10 cm. The base substrate has a standard thickness of at least about 350 m with a dopant concentration in a range of at least 10 cm. The epilayer thickness and dopant concentration are selected based on the blocking voltage desired for the device. The epilayer may be epitaxially grown on the base substrate using well known techniques such as metal organic chemical vapor deposition MOCVD to form substrate which is shown in as including upper surface and an opposite bottom surface . Nitrogen or phosphorous may be used as the n type dopants.

To form p type region an oxide layer is first deposited on upper surface of substrate using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD or a low pressure CVD LPCVD process. The oxide layer is then patterned using well known photolithography to form oxide mask as shown in . Ion implantation is then carried out using oxide mask to form p type region within substrate . Region may be formed as having a depth of about 0.4 m from upper surface of substrate . Aluminum boron or beryllium may be used as the p type dopant. Ion implantation may be carried out so that region may have a dopant profile that is graded in the vertical or y direction. For example although not shown in an upper portion of region may have a dopant concentration of at least about 10 cm and a lower portion of region may have a dopant concentration of at least about 10 cm. Subsequent ion implantation the structure is annealed at a temperature of about 1600 C. for about at least 5 minutes for example to activate the impurities implanted therein. Mask is subsequently removed.

Referring to after removal of mask shown in n type layer having upper surface is epitaxially regrown on the upper part of the structure by MOCVD for example as particularly on upper surface of substrate and upper surface of region . Layer may be epitaxially regrown to have a dopant profile that is graded in the vertical or y direction. For example although not shown in detail in layer may be epitaxially grown to have a total thickness of about 0.7 m as including a first sublayer on substrate region that has a dopant concentration of about 10 cmand a thickness of about 0.2 m and a second sublayer that has a dopant concentration of about 10 cmand a thickness of about 0.5 m on the first sublayer. It should be understood that the respective thicknesses and dopant concentrations of the sublayers are exemplary only and may be selected according to design preference. Moreover although described as having a graded dopant profile in view of the sublayers layer may in the alternative be epitaxially regrown as having substantially uniform concentration.

Referring to subsequent epitaxial regrowth of layer shown in an oxide layer is deposited on upper surface of layer by MOCVD for example. The oxide layer is patterned using well known photolithography to form oxide mask that exposes a portion of upper surface of layer above region . Layer is subsequently etched using mask and a dry etching technique such as reactive ion etching RIE to form first trench having trench bottom within layer . First trench may have a depth of about 0.5 m from upper surface of layer to trench bottom for example. As shown intermediate portion of layer remains between trench bottom and upper surface of region . Subsequent to the etching ion implantation is carried out using mask to set the final n type dopant concentration of intermediate portion that will form the channel under gate sections shown in . This final dopant concentration of intermediate portion that will be disposed under gate sections is set to about 5 10 cm. The concentration accuracy achieved using implantation is superior to epitaxy and the ability to adjust the final doping level in region by implantation allows very accurate control of the threshold voltage of the device.

With reference to after the ion implantation as described with respect to a silicon nitride layer is regrown on the entirety of the structure using well known techniques such as Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition PECVD . As shown silicon nitride layer covers the upper surface of oxide mask the side surfaces of oxide mask above first trench and the sidewalls and trench bottom of first trench . The thickness of layer will determine the final active channel length and is chosen according to the high voltage design of the device. For example layer may have a thickness of about 0.3 to 1.5 microns. Alternative dielectric materials such as silicon dioxide may be used dependent on the required implantation profile.

With reference to after formation of silicon nitride layer as shown in layer is anisotropically etched using an RIE process to remove portions of layer from the upper surface of oxide mask and from a central region of trench bottom . Due to the anisotropic nature of the etch portions of layer remain as spacers covering the side surfaces of oxide mask and the sidewalls of first trench and on peripheral portions of trench bottom near the sidewalls of first trench . Thereafter another n type ion implantation is carried out using spacers and oxide mask to form n type source contact area within layer below the central region of trench bottom between spacers . The dopant concentration of source contact area is at least about 10 cm.

It should be understood that the above noted etching of silicon nitride layer to form spacers as described with respect to defines the gate length of gate sections shown in . That is the gate length of gate sections in is bounded by source contact area whereby the extent of source contact area in the horizontal or x direction is very accurately controlled by the growth and subsequent anisotropic etching of silicon nitride layer . The gate length is thus defined by the growth of layer so that a short gate length in a range of about 0.3 to 1.5 m that would otherwise be less easily achieved using standard photolithography techniques used in power device manufacture.

With reference to after the implantation as described with respect to spacers and oxide mask are removed by wet etching using hydrofluoric acid for example. The structure is then annealed at a low temperature of at least about 1200 C. to activate the impurities within source contact area . Thereafter gate oxide having a thickness in a range of about 50 100 nm is grown by thermal oxidation at a temperature greater than about 1000 C. Gate oxidation covers an entirety of the structure as shown in as particularly on upper surface of layer on the sidewalls of first trench and on trench bottom . Gate oxide thus covers both intermediate portion channel and source contact area . A post oxidation anneal in nitrous oxide NO or NO may be carried out to improve oxide quality. Alternatively a combination of thin thermally grown oxide may be combined with a deposited gate oxide formed using a technique such as Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition LPCVD .

With reference to after formation of gate oxide as described with respect to a gate layer that may be polycrystalline silicon having a thickness corresponding to the chosen channel length i.e. largely equal to or greater than that of the silicon nitride later is deposited on the entirety of gate oxide using an LPCVD process at a temperature of about 650 C. Gate layer may be doped using boron or aluminum.

With reference to after formation of gate layer shown in gate layer is anisotropically etched using an RIE process to remove portions of gate layer from the top of gate oxide above upper surface of layer and from the central region of trench bottom above source contact area . Due to the anisotropic nature of the etch portions of gate layer remain as gate sections on gate oxide covering side surfaces of first trench and over peripheral portions of trench bottom near the sidewalls of first trench . Gate sections respectively have a gate length in the vertical or x direction in a range of about 0.3 to 1.5 m.

With reference to after etching as described with respect to a resist layer is subsequently formed over the entirety of the structure particularly as on gate oxide over upper surface of layer on gate sections and on gate oxide within first trench over source contact area . The resist layer is subsequently patterned using well known photolithography to form resist mask having a narrow opening that exposes gate oxide on trench bottom over source contact area . A dry etch such as RIE is subsequently carried out using resist mask to etch and remove exposed gate oxide and to etch and remove source contact area under the removed portion of gate oxide . A narrow second trench is thus formed through gate oxide and source contact area to expose upper surface of region . Resist mask is subsequently removed.

With reference to after removal of resist mask shown in another resist layer is subsequently formed on the entirety of the structure as particularly on gate oxide over upper surface of layer on gate sections within first trench on gate oxide and within second trench on upper surface of region . This resist layer is subsequently patterned using well known photolithography to form resist mask which includes a narrow opening that exposes upper surface of region and portions of gate oxide over source contact area . A very short controlled etch is subsequently carried out using resist mask to remove exposed gate oxide over source contact area . Thus upper surfaces of source contact area are exposed for subsequent contact metallization. The resist mask is subsequently used in a lift off process whereby a thin layer of metal such as nickel or titanium tungsten having a thickness of about 100 nm is deposited onto upper surfaces of source contact area and within second trench on upper surface of region . A thin layer of metal such as nickel or titanium tungsten having a thickness of about 100 nm not shown in is also deposited onto the back surface of the substrate as a preliminary drain contact layer. The structure is then annealed at a temperature of 950 C. to form ohmic metal contact . Resist mask is thereafter removed.

With reference to after removal of resist mask shown in field dielectric layer which may be silicon nitride having a thickness of about 1 m is deposited over the entirety of the surface of the structure using PECVD for example. Field dielectric layer is particularly deposited on gate oxide over upper surface of layer on gate sections and within first and second trenches and on metal contact and gate oxide .

With reference to after formation of field dielectric layer as described with respect to a resist layer is subsequently formed on an entirety of upper surface of field dielectric layer . The resist layer is subsequently patterned using well known photolithography to form resist mask as having a narrow opening aligned over metal contact . A dry etch such as RIE is then carried out using resist mask to remove field dielectric layer and to thus form trench that exposes metal contact . Resist mask is then removed.

With reference to after removal of resist mask as shown in a metal layer is subsequently deposited over the entirety of the surface of the structure as particularly on upper surface of field dielectric and to fill trench on metal contact . The metal layer may be a single metal layer of aluminum for instance but in the alternative may be a multilayer stack including titanium and aluminum sublayers. The metal layer as deposited on upper surface of field dielectric layer may have a thickness of about 1 m. Source contact is thus formed as including metal contact not shown in and source finger . The device is completed by depositing drain contact on the preliminary drain contact layer deposited on bottom surface of substrate wherein drain contact may also be a single metal layer of titanium or aluminum for instance but in the alternative may be a multilayer stack including titanium and aluminum sublayers.

Although the present invention has been described in detail the scope of the invention should not be limited by the corresponding description and figures. Although not specifically highlighted the crystal type of the silicon carbide described in this invention is assumed to be 4H however alternate crystal polytypes such as 6H 15R and 3C may also be used without impacting the design or method of operation of the device described. The orientation of the crystal is such that the epitaxial layers are grown on the Si face of the crystal but alternatively may also be grown on the C face . Also the concepts described above should be applicable as well for the case where the conductivity types of substrate and layer are reversed to be p type and the conductivity type of region is reversed to be n type. In this alternative case the potentials as applied to the gate contact the source contact and the drain contact would be inverted as would be understood by one of ordinary skill. These various changes and modifications of the embodiments as would become apparent to one of ordinary skill should be considered as within the spirit and scope of the invention.
